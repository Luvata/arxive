      <title>Recurrence Meets Transformers for Universal Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged. Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents. In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets.

      <title>Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

      <title>PromptGuard: An Orchestrated Prompting Framework for Principled Synthetic Text Generation for Vulnerable Populations using LLMs with Enhanced Safety, Fairness, and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning. VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting, Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation, and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory, and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets, establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.</description>

      <title>Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection (OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%), demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios. The implementation of Beta-SOD is available at: https://github.com/waqar3411/Beta-SOD</description>

      <title>SFD-Mamba2Net: Strcture-Guided Frequency-Enhanced Dual-Stream Mamba2 Network for Coronary Artery Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures, which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies. Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures, suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception (PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.</description>

      <title>Live(r) Die: Predicting Survival in Colorectal Liver Metastasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis. SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers, delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable outcome prediction in CRLM.</description>

      <title>Discovering Divergent Representations between Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon (Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models, finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American people in media professions.

      <title>An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications. One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and sun glint areas in the images.</description>

      <title>CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However, their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of transformers for small-scale vision.

      <title>iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch) datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios, scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>UltrON: Ultrasound Occupancy Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel- or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations, overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity. Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D reconstruction.

      <description>arXiv:2509.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$ faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.</description>

      <title>E-MLNet: Enhanced Mutual Learning for Universal Domain Adaptation with Sample-Specific Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet) use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization (OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet), which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of 31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused adaptation strategy.</description>

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale, high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000 images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency; low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems.</description>

      <title>VoxelFormer: Parameter-Efficient Multi-Subject Visual Decoding from fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in fMRI-based visual decoding have enabled compelling reconstructions of perceived images. However, most approaches rely on subject-specific training, limiting scalability and practical deployment. We introduce \textbf{VoxelFormer}, a lightweight transformer architecture that enables multi-subject training for visual decoding from fMRI. VoxelFormer integrates a Token Merging Transformer (ToMer) for efficient voxel compression and a query-driven Q-Former that produces fixed-size neural representations aligned with the CLIP image embedding space. Evaluated on the 7T Natural Scenes Dataset, VoxelFormer achieves competitive retrieval performance on subjects included during training with significantly fewer parameters than existing methods. These results highlight token merging and query-based transformers as promising strategies for parameter-efficient neural decoding.</description>

      <title>Integrating Anatomical Priors into a Causal Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses, particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches. Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature. This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Medical Image Understanding with Pretraining Aided by 2D Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks, potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets, and pre-trained models will be available at https://github.com/Qybc/Med3DInsight.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Human-Object Interaction Action Recognition Using Scene Information and Multi-Task Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses. However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%, outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by 2.75%.</description>

      <title>IRDFusion: Iterative Relation-Map Difference guided Feature Fusion for Multispectral Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel, specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion. IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/61s61min/IRDFusion.git.</description>

      <title>SQAP-VLA: A Synergistic Quantization-Aware Pruning Framework for High-Performance Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured, training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline, where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93 speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the original model.</description>

      <title>S-BEVLoc: BEV-based Self-supervised Framework for Large-scale LiDAR Global Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization. Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features, and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort for supervised approaches.</description>

      <title>FPI-Det: a face--phone Interaction Dataset for phone-use detection and understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors, providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes, occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at https://github.com/KvCgRv/FPI-Det.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Hierarchical Plant Segmentation via Foundation Segmentation Models and Text-to-image Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However, segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods. Implementations are available at https://github.com/JunhaoXing/ZeroPlantSeg.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic Framework for Robust Text-based Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images, and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ALL-PET: A Low-resource and Low-shot PET Foundation Model in the Projection Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource, low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain. ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations. First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over 200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments, ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Topology Estimation of 2D Image Data via Neural Networks and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling alternative to PH under structural noise.</description>

      <title>Objectness Similarity: Capturing Object-Level Fidelity in 3D Scene Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality, leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify advancements in this field. The code is available at https://github.com/Objectness-Similarity/OSIM.</description>

      <title>Video Understanding by Design: How Datasets Shape Architectures and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span, hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding.</description>

      <title>OCELOT 2023: Cell Detection from Cell-Tissue Interaction Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</description>

      <title>RT-DETR++ for UAV Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++, which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge Noise Mitigation Framework for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers. Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy. First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CWSSNet: Hyperspectral Image Classification Enhanced by Wavelet Domain Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However, although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics. To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as the research area to perform ground object classification research. A classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%, and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies, vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level, indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Ideal and Real-world Evaluation: Benchmarking AI-Generated Image Detection in Challenging Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image synthesis has posed new challenges to digital security and media credibility. Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated images. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection methods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on human adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dark-ISP: Enhancing RAW Image Processing for Low-Light Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.</description>

      <title>VQualA 2025 Challenge on Visual Quality Comparison for Large Multimodal Models: Methods and Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the VQualA 2025 Challenge on Visual Quality Comparison for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), hosted as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshop on Visual Quality Assessment. The challenge aims to evaluate and enhance the ability of state-of-the-art LMMs to perform open-ended and detailed reasoning about visual quality differences across multiple images. To this end, the competition introduces a novel benchmark comprising thousands of coarse-to-fine grained visual quality comparison tasks, spanning single images, pairs, and multi-image groups. Each task requires models to provide accurate quality judgments. The competition emphasizes holistic evaluation protocols, including 2AFC-based binary preference and multi-choice questions (MCQs). Around 100 participants submitted entries, with five models demonstrating the emerging capabilities of instruction-tuned LMMs on quality assessment. This challenge marks a significant step toward open-domain visual quality reasoning and comparison and serves as a catalyst for future research on interpretable and human-aligned quality evaluation systems.</description>

      <title>MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities: coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.</description>

      <title>Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.</description>

      <title>CoAtNeXt:An Attention-Enhanced ConvNeXtV2-Transformer Hybrid Model for Gastric Tissue Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets, HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved 96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89% AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07% precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature. Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Dental AI: A Multimodal Benchmark and Instruction Dataset for Panoramic X-ray Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model, benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/isbrycee/OralGPT.</description>

      <title>DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order. However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy. Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t. absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Unified Start, Personalized End: Progressive Pruning for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87% across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical application.</description>

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each task.</description>

      <title>Modality-Agnostic Input Channels Enable Segmentation of Brain lesions in Multimodal MRI with Sequences Unavailable During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged, MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information. This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities, and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple, thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI, DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training, while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

      <title>Model-Agnostic Open-Set Air-to-Air Visual Object Detection for Reliable UAV Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Object-Centric Representations in SAR Images with Multi-Level Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features. Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations, regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.</description>

      <title>Can Multimodal LLMs See Materials Clearly? A Multimodal Benchmark on Materials Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information, revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising 1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/MatCha.</description>

      <title>You Share Beliefs, I Adapt: Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance. Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios. Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.</description>

      <title>Image Recognition with Vision and Language Embeddings of VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/gonikisgo/bmvc2025-vlm-image-recognition.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Customized Fashion Design with Image-into-Prompt benchmark and dataset from LMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI evolves the execution of complex workflows in industry, where the large multimodal model empowers fashion design in the garment industry. Current generation AI models magically transform brainstorming into fancy designs easily, but the fine-grained customization still suffers from text uncertainty without professional background knowledge from end-users. Thus, we propose the Better Understanding Generation (BUG) workflow with LMM to automatically create and fine-grain customize the cloth designs from chat with image-into-prompt. Our framework unleashes users' creative potential beyond words and also lowers the barriers of clothing design/editing without further human involvement. To prove the effectiveness of our model, we propose a new FashionEdit dataset that simulates the real-world clothing design workflow, evaluated from generation similarity, user satisfaction, and quality.

      <title>Exploring Pre-training Across Domains for Few-Shot Surgical Skill Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA. In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones, achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28% in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation.

      <title>Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Texture-aware Intrinsic Image Decomposition with Model- and Learning-based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect. We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce superior results to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-play Diffusion Models for Image Compressive Sensing with Data Consistency Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation, subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding, limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm 0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute neurological conditions.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Integrated-Circuit Defect Segmentation via Image-Intrinsic Normality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training. Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Clinical and Class-Agnostic Features for Reliable Few-Shot Adaptation under Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift.

      <title>FS-Diff: Semantic guidance and clarity-aware simultaneous multimodal image fusion and super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions, the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted, with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images. Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics in the fused images.

      <title>Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns, i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data. These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled. Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space. Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in https://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.</description>

      <title>FlexiD-Fuse: Flexible number of inputs multi-modal medical image fusion based on diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Glioma Segmentation on Sub-Saharan MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity, our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80 for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture, approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and accessible medical imaging solutions.</description>

      <title>OpenFake: An Open Dataset and Platform Toward Large-Scale Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models. Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from sophisticated misinformation threats.</description>

      <title>Improving Human Motion Plausibility with Body Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn, driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics, while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement. Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.</description>

      <title>Region-Wise Correspondence Prediction between Manga Line Art Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for real-world manga applications.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network for Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1) Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data. Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.</description>

      <title>DualTrack: Sensorless 3D Ultrasound needs Local and Global Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction. The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone (e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory. Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions, outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error below 5 mm.</description>

      <title>Improving Video Diffusion Transformer Training by Multi-Feature Fusion and Alignment from Self-Supervised Vision Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results are available on our project page: https://align4gen.github.io/align4gen/</description>

      <title>InterAct: Advancing Large-Scale Versatile 3D Human-Object Interaction Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81 hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this area, the dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.</description>

      <title>Invisible Attributes, Visible Biases: Exploring Demographic Shortcuts in MRI-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks. Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at https://github.com/acharaakshit/ShortMR</description>

      <title>PeftCD: Leveraging Vision Foundation Models with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples, and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/PeftCD.</description>

      <title>Visual Grounding from Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data. Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes -- appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects -- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding, enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.</description>

      <title>Kling-Avatar: Grounding Multimodal Instructions for Cascaded Long-Duration Avatar Animation Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</description>

      <title>Measuring Epistemic Humility in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above" option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection, HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at https://github.com/maifoundations/HumbleBench.</description>

      <title>Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE, a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation, where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.</description>

      <title>Geometric Neural Distance Fields for Learning Human Motion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods, our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations, respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce: (i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out" realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to partial 2D / 3D observations.</description>

      <title>Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models, proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior expert-crafted alternative.</description>

      <title>SpatialVID: A Large-Scale Video Dataset with Spatial Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale, diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes, camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses, depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video and 3D vision research community.</description>

      <title>FLUX-Reason-6M &amp; PRISM-Bench: A Million-Scale Text-to-Image Reasoning Dataset and Comprehensive Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page: https://flux-reason-6m.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>DeepTV: A neural network approach for total variation minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05569v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular. In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>CameraVDP: Perceptual Display Assessment with Uncertainty Estimation via Camera and Visual Difference Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals for VDP quality scores.</description>

      <title>Value bounds and Convergence Analysis for Averages of LRP attributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Deep Learning-Based Scatter Estimation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods. Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations (FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to 4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times 10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and 12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.</description>

      <title>Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors, highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor. These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Mind Meets Space: Rethinking Agentic Spatial Intelligence from a Neuroscience-inspired Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments. Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end, we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments. We hope this work will benefit the research community with a neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page can be found at Github.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pareto-Optimal Token Merging for Edge Transformer Models in Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Statistical Similarity Trap in Extreme Convection Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a "Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare, high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition, physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3) architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task, with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather preparedness.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Structural Recovery Parameters Enhance Prediction of Visual Outcomes After Macular Hole Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH) patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features. Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables, OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy across all timepoints (mean Dice &gt; 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as significant BCVA predictors (P &lt; 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as 0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.</description>

      <title>Virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology of bone implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>OmniEVA: Embodied Versatile Planner via Task-Adaptive 3D-Grounded and Embodiment-aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding, reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making. Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks, including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile planning capabilities.

      <title>In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF, all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework, termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second, we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Accelerated Microstructure Imaging: A SHAP-Guided Protocol on the Connectome 2.0 scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time. However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast, and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.</description>

      <title>ObjectReact: Learning Object-Relative Control for Visual Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative" approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level "WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world indoor environments.

      <title>Graph Alignment via Dual-Pass Spectral Encoding and Latent Space Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.</description>

      <title>DiFlow-TTS: Discrete Flow Matching with Factorized Speech Tokens for Low-Latency Zero-Shot Text-To-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample, requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness, prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to 25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Dexplore: Scalable Neural Control for Dexterous Manipulation from Reference-Scoped Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale, contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>Total Disentanglement of Font Images into Style and Character Class Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a total disentanglement of font images. Total disentanglement is a neural network-based method for decomposing each font image nonlinearly and completely into its style and content (i.e., character class) features. It uses a simple but careful training procedure to extract the common style feature from all `A'-`Z' images in the same font and the common content feature from all `A' (or another class) images in different fonts. These disentangled features guarantee the reconstruction of the original font image. Various experiments have been conducted to understand the performance of total disentanglement. First, it is demonstrated that total disentanglement is achievable with very high accuracy; this is experimental proof of the long-standing open question, ``Does `A'-ness exist?'' Hofstadter (1985). Second, it is demonstrated that the disentangled features produced by total disentanglement apply to a variety of tasks, including font recognition, character recognition, and one-shot font image generation.

      <description>arXiv:2404.02353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning models are incredibly data-hungry and require very large labeled datasets for supervised learning. As a consequence, these models often suffer from overfitting, limiting their ability to generalize to real-world examples. Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic images based on textual inputs. Leveraging the substantial datasets used to train these diffusion models, we propose a technique to utilize generated images to augment existing datasets. This paper explores various strategies for effective data augmentation to improve the out-of-domain generalization capabilities of deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual OCR and information extraction from receipts remains challenging, particularly for complex scripts like Arabic. We introduce \dataset, a comprehensive dataset designed for Arabic-English receipt understanding comprising 20,000 annotated receipts from diverse retail settings, 30,000 OCR-annotated images, and 10,000 item-level annotations, and a new Receipt QA subset with 1265 receipt images paired with 40 question-answer pairs each to support LLM evaluation for receipt understanding. The dataset captures merchant names, item descriptions, prices, receipt numbers, and dates to support object detection, OCR, and information extraction tasks. We establish baseline performance using traditional methods (Tesseract OCR) and advanced neural networks, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness for processing complex, noisy real-world receipt layouts. Our publicly accessible dataset advances automated multilingual document processing research (see https://github.com/Update-For-Integrated-Business-AI/CORU ).</description>

      <title>Automatic infant 2D pose estimation from videos: comparing seven deep neural network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic markerless estimation of infant posture and motion from ordinary videos carries great potential for movement studies "in the wild", facilitating understanding of motor development and massively increasing the chances of early diagnosis of disorders. There is rapid development of human pose estimation methods in computer vision thanks to advances in deep learning and machine learning. However, these methods are trained on datasets that feature adults in different contexts. This work tests and compares seven popular methods (AlphaPose, DeepLabCut/DeeperCut, Detectron2, HRNet, MediaPipe/BlazePose, OpenPose, and ViTPose) on videos of infants in supine position and in more complex settings. Surprisingly, all methods except DeepLabCut and MediaPipe have competitive performance without additional finetuning, with ViTPose performing best. Next to standard performance metrics (average precision and recall), we introduce errors expressed in the neck-mid-hip (torso length) ratio and additionally study missed and redundant detections, and the reliability of the internal confidence ratings of the different methods, which are relevant for downstream tasks. Among the networks with competitive performance, only AlphaPose could run close to real time (27 fps) on our machine. We provide documented Docker containers or instructions for all the methods we used, our analysis scripts, and the processed data at https://hub.docker.com/u/humanoidsctu and https://osf.io/x465b/.</description>

      <title>Attention-Guided Multi-scale Interaction Network for Face Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, CNN and Transformer hybrid networks demonstrated excellent performance in face super-resolution (FSR) tasks. Since numerous features at different scales in hybrid networks, how to fuse these multiscale features and promote their complementarity is crucial for enhancing FSR. However, existing hybrid network-based FSR methods ignore this, only simply combining the Transformer and CNN. To address this issue, we propose an attention-guided Multiscale interaction network (AMINet), which incorporates local and global feature interactions, as well as encoder-decoder phase feature interactions. Specifically, we propose a Local and Global Feature Interaction Module (LGFI) to promote the fusion of global features and the local features extracted from different receptive fields by our Residual Depth Feature Extraction Module (RDFE). Additionally, we propose a Selective Kernel Attention Fusion Module (SKAF) to adaptively select fusions of different features within the LGFI and encoder-decoder phases. Our above design allows the free flow of multiscale features from within modules and between the encoder and decoder, which can promote the complementarity of different scale features to enhance FSR. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our method consistently performs well with less computational consumption and faster inference.</description>

      <title>IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00827v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.VLJailbreakBench is publicly available at https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench.</description>

      <title>The Oxford Spires Dataset: Benchmarking Large-Scale LiDAR-Visual Localisation, Reconstruction and Radiance Field Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a large-scale multi-modal dataset captured in and around well-known landmarks in Oxford using a custom-built multi-sensor perception unit as well as a millimetre-accurate map from a Terrestrial LiDAR Scanner (TLS). The perception unit includes three synchronised global shutter colour cameras, an automotive 3D LiDAR scanner, and an inertial sensor - all precisely calibrated. We also establish benchmarks for tasks involving localisation, reconstruction, and novel-view synthesis, which enable the evaluation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) methods, Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-view Stereo (MVS) methods as well as radiance field methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting. To evaluate 3D reconstruction the TLS 3D models are used as ground truth. Localisation ground truth is computed by registering the mobile LiDAR scans to the TLS 3D models. Radiance field methods are evaluated not only with poses sampled from the input trajectory, but also from viewpoints that are from trajectories which are distant from the training poses. Our evaluation demonstrates a key limitation of state-of-the-art radiance field methods: we show that they tend to overfit to the training poses/images and do not generalise well to out-of-sequence poses. They also underperform in 3D reconstruction compared to MVS systems using the same visual inputs. Our dataset and benchmarks are intended to facilitate better integration of radiance field methods and SLAM systems. The raw and processed data, along with software for parsing and evaluation, can be accessed at https://dynamic.robots.ox.ac.uk/datasets/oxford-spires/.</description>

      <title>EgoAgent: A Joint Predictive Agent Model in Egocentric Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning an agent model that behaves like humans-capable of jointly perceiving the environment, predicting the future, and taking actions from a first-person perspective-is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Existing methods typically train separate models for these abilities, which fail to capture their intrinsic relationships and prevent them from learning from each other. Inspired by how humans learn through the perception-action loop, we propose EgoAgent, a unified agent model that simultaneously learns to represent, predict, and act within a single transformer. EgoAgent explicitly models the causal and temporal dependencies among these abilities by formulating the task as an interleaved sequence of states and actions. It further introduces a joint embedding-action-prediction architecture with temporally asymmetric predictor and observer branches, enabling synergistic optimization across all three capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/zju3dv/EgoAgent.</description>

      <title>ForestSplats: Deformable transient field for Gaussian Splatting in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged, showing real-time rendering speeds and high-quality results in static scenes. Although 3D-GS shows effectiveness in static scenes, their performance significantly degrades in real-world environments due to transient objects, lighting variations, and diverse levels of occlusion. To tackle this, existing methods estimate occluders or transient elements by leveraging pre-trained models or integrating additional transient field pipelines. However, these methods still suffer from two defects: 1) Using semantic features from the Vision Foundation model (VFM) causes additional computational costs. 2) The transient field requires significant memory to handle transient elements with per-view Gaussians and struggles to define clear boundaries for occluders, solely relying on photometric errors. To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel approach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware mask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across unconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from transient distractors without VFM. We designed the transient field to be deformable, capturing per-view transient elements. Furthermore, we introduce a superpixel-aware mask that clearly defines the boundaries of occluders by considering photometric errors and superpixels. Additionally, we propose uncertainty-aware densification to avoid generating Gaussians within the boundaries of occluders during densification. Through extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that ForestSplats outperforms existing methods without VFM and shows significant memory efficiency in representing transient elements.</description>

      <title>Parasite: A Steganography-based Backdoor Attack Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has gained significant attention as one of the most successful image generation models, which can generate high-quality images by iteratively sampling noise. However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks. In addition, in the ablation study, we discuss the influence of different hiding coefficients on the attack results. You can find our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Parasite-1715/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DEEVISum (Distilled Early Exit Vision language model for Summarization), a lightweight, efficient, and scalable vision language model designed for segment wise video summarization. Leveraging multi modal prompts that combine textual and audio derived signals, DEEVISum incorporates Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation (MSKD) and Early Exit (EE) to strike a balance between performance and efficiency. MSKD offers a 1.33% absolute F1 improvement over baseline distillation (0.5%), while EE reduces inference time by approximately 21% with a 1.3 point drop in F1. Evaluated on the TVSum dataset, our best model PaLI Gemma2 3B + MSKD achieves an F1 score of 61.1, competing the performance of significantly larger models, all while maintaining a lower computational footprint. We publicly release our code and processed dataset to support further research.</description>

      <title>Combating Falsification of Speech Videos with Live Optical Signatures (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-profile speech videos are prime targets for falsification, owing to their accessibility and influence. This work proposes VeriLight, a low-overhead and unobtrusive system for protecting speech videos from visual manipulations of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike the predominant purely digital falsification detection methods, VeriLight creates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all video recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures encode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including the speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to prevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and validated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key elements of VeriLight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact (i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on locality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds $&gt;$200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live. Experiments on extensive video datasets show VeriLight achieves AUCs $\geq$ 0.99 and a true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified videos. Further, VeriLight is highly robust across recording conditions, video post-processing techniques, and white-box adversarial attacks on its feature extraction methods. A demonstration of VeriLight is available at https://mobilex.cs.columbia.edu/verilight.</description>

      <title>GAPrompt: Geometry-Aware Point Cloud Prompt for 3D Vision Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained 3D vision models have gained significant attention for their promising performance on point cloud data. However, fully fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is computationally expensive and storage-intensive. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, which focus primarily on input token prompting, struggle to achieve competitive performance due to their limited ability to capture the geometric information inherent in point clouds. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometry-Aware Point Cloud Prompt (GAPrompt) that leverages geometric cues to enhance the adaptability of 3D vision models. First, we introduce a Point Prompt that serves as an auxiliary input alongside the original point cloud, explicitly guiding the model to capture fine-grained geometric details. Additionally, we present a Point Shift Prompter designed to extract global shape information from the point cloud, enabling instance-specific geometric adjustments at the input level. Moreover, our proposed Prompt Propagation mechanism incorporates the shape information into the model's feature extraction process, further strengthening its ability to capture essential geometric characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GAPrompt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods and achieves competitive results compared to full fine-tuning on various benchmarks, while utilizing only 2.19% of trainable parameters. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-GAPrompt.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are typical complex intelligent systems with artificial intelligence at their core. However, perception methods based on deep learning are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in security accidents. How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D domains, which simultaneously optimizes texture maps in 2D image and 3D mesh spaces to better address intra-class diversity and real-world environmental variations. The framework includes a novel realistic enhanced adversarial module, with time-space and relighting mapping pipeline that adjusts illumination consistency between adversarial patches and target garments under varied viewpoints. Building upon this, we develop a realism enhancement mechanism that incorporates non-rigid deformation modeling and texture remapping to ensure alignment with the human body's non-rigid surfaces in 3D scenes. Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead the target detection model. Specifically, our method achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 70.13% on YOLOv12 in physical scenarios, significantly outperforming existing methods such as T-SEA (21.65%) and AdvTexture (19.70%). Moreover, the proposed method maintains stable ASR across multiple viewpoints and distances, with an average attack success rate exceeding 90% under both frontal and oblique views at a distance of 4 meters. This confirms the method's strong robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting conditions, and real-world distances.

      <title>MM-Prompt: Cross-Modal Prompt Tuning for Continual Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Visual Question Answering (CVQA) based on pre-trained models(PTMs) has achieved promising progress by leveraging prompt tuning to enable continual multi-modal learning. However, most existing methods adopt cross-modal prompt isolation, constructing visual and textual prompts separately, which exacerbates modality imbalance and leads to degraded performance over time. To tackle this issue, we propose MM-Prompt, a novel framework incorporating cross-modal prompt query and cross-modal prompt recovery. The former enables balanced prompt selection by incorporating cross-modal signals during query formation, while the latter promotes joint prompt reconstruction through iterative cross-modal interactions, guided by an alignment loss to prevent representational drift. Extensive experiments show that MM-Prompt surpasses prior approaches in accuracy and knowledge retention, while maintaining balanced modality engagement throughout continual learning.</description>

      <title>TESSER: Transfer-Enhancing Adversarial Attacks from Vision Transformers via Spectral and Semantic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial transferability remains a critical challenge in evaluating the robustness of deep neural networks. In security-critical applications, transferability enables black-box attacks without access to model internals, making it a key concern for real-world adversarial threat assessment. While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong adversarial performance, existing attacks often fail to transfer effectively across architectures, especially from ViTs to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or hybrid models. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TESSER} -- a novel adversarial attack framework that enhances transferability via two key strategies: (1) \textit{Feature-Sensitive Gradient Scaling (FSGS)}, which modulates gradients based on token-wise importance derived from intermediate feature activations, and (2) \textit{Spectral Smoothness Regularization (SSR)}, which suppresses high-frequency noise in perturbations using a differentiable Gaussian prior. These components work in tandem to generate perturbations that are both semantically meaningful and spectrally smooth. Extensive experiments on ImageNet across 12 diverse architectures demonstrate that TESSER achieves +10.9\% higher attack succes rate (ASR) on CNNs and +7.2\% on ViTs compared to the state-of-the-art Adaptive Token Tuning (ATT) method. Moreover, TESSER significantly improves robustness against defended models, achieving 53.55\% ASR on adversarially trained CNNs. Qualitative analysis shows strong alignment between TESSER's perturbations and salient visual regions identified via Grad-CAM, while frequency-domain analysis reveals a 12\% reduction in high-frequency energy, confirming the effectiveness of spectral regularization.</description>

      <title>Hallo4: High-Fidelity Dynamic Portrait Animation via Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating highly dynamic and photorealistic portrait animations driven by audio and skeletal motion remains challenging due to the need for precise lip synchronization, natural facial expressions, and high-fidelity body motion dynamics. We propose a human-preference-aligned diffusion framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce direct preference optimization tailored for human-centric animation, leveraging a curated dataset of human preferences to align generated outputs with perceptual metrics for portrait motion-video alignment and naturalness of expression. Second, the proposed temporal motion modulation resolves spatiotemporal resolution mismatches by reshaping motion conditions into dimensionally aligned latent features through temporal channel redistribution and proportional feature expansion, preserving the fidelity of high-frequency motion details in diffusion-based synthesis. The proposed mechanism is complementary to existing UNet and DiT-based portrait diffusion approaches, and experiments demonstrate obvious improvements in lip-audio synchronization, expression vividness, body motion coherence over baseline methods, alongside notable gains in human preference metrics.

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Diffusion and Reinforcement Learning for Joint Plane Localization and Anomaly Diagnosis in 3D Ultrasound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Congenital uterine anomalies (CUAs) can lead to infertility, miscarriage, preterm birth, and an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

      <title>An Improved U-Net Model for Offline handwriting signature denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials. However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical support for signature analysis and recognition.</description>

      <title>JAX-IK: Real-Time Inverse Kinematics for Generating Multi-Constrained Movements of Virtual Human Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK, and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods.

      <title>GEMINUS: Dual-aware Global and Scene-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework featuring a Global Expert and a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, equipped with a Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router, GEMINUS achieves both adaptability and robustness across diverse scenarios. GEMINUS outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even with only monocular vision input.

      <title>VFlowOpt: A Token Pruning Framework for LMMs with Visual Information Flow-Guided Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically, we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning, thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs. Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache memory and 3.8 times faster inference.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Training for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of \textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression \textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80 million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller}, the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further research building upon our contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Objective: To address the inability of single-model architectures to perform simultaneous analysis of complex glomerular ultrastructures, we developed Glo-UMF, a unified multi-model framework integrating segmentation, classification, and detection to systematically quantify key ultrastructural features. Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features. This framework ensures robust generalization and clinical applicability, demonstrating significant potential as an efficient auxiliary tool in glomerular pathological analysis.</description>

      <title>S$^2$-Guidance: Stochastic Self Guidance for Training-Free Enhancement of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks, effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its strong long-range dependency modelling ability. \textcolor{blue}{However, its large model size and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and performance in downstream vision tasks, we propose an efficient ViT model with sparse attention (dubbed SAEViT) and convolution blocks. Specifically, a Sparsely Aggregated Attention (SAA) module has been proposed to perform adaptive sparse sampling and recover the feature map via deconvolution operation,} which significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and redistribution, which mitigates the redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks (FFN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively, demonstrating a lightweight solution for fundamental vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Drawing2CAD: Sequence-to-Sequence Learning for CAD Generation from Vector Drawings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18733v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.</description>

However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.</description>

      <title>Improving Alignment in LVLMs with Debiased Self-Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets, human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.</description>

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging: autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training, achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training, the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full attention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.</description>

      <title>Missing Fine Details in Images: Last Seen in High Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, generated images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information during optimization, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Moreover, we integrate our frequency-preserving latent embeddings into a SOTA latent diffusion model, resulting in sharper and more realistic image generation. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image synthesis, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-BIND-T: Improved and Temporally Consistent Sensor Modality Translation and Fusion for Robotic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latent representations, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windowed temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</description>

      <title>TinyDef-DETR: A DETR-based Framework for Defect Detection in Transmission Lines from UAV Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated defect detection from UAV imagery of transmission lines is a challenging task due to the small size, ambiguity, and complex backgrounds of defects. This paper proposes TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed to achieve accurate and efficient detection of transmission line defects from UAV-acquired images. The model integrates four major components: an edge-enhanced ResNet backbone to strengthen boundary-sensitive representations, a stride-free space-to-depth module to enable detail-preserving downsampling, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention mechanism to jointly model global context and local cues, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve the localization of small and difficult targets. Together, these designs effectively mitigate the limitations of conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves superior detection performance and strong generalization capability, while maintaining modest computational overhead. The accuracy and efficiency of TinyDef-DETR make it a suitable method for UAV-based transmission line defect detection, particularly in scenarios involving small and ambiguous targets.</description>

      <title>Focusing by Contrastive Attention: Enhancing VLMs' Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</description>

      <title>3D and 4D World Modeling: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data, they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions, introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen), occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges, and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and foundational reference for advancing the field.

      <title>VRAE: Vertical Residual Autoencoder for License Plate Denoising and Deblurring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance. The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the representation learning process, enabling better general information preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders. Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20%, reduces NMSE by around 50%, and enhances SSIM by 1%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly 1% in parameters.</description>

      <title>MESH -- Understanding Videos Like Human: Measuring Hallucinations in Large Video Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions. Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects in longer videos.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Medical Image Segmentation by Modeling Evidential Calibrated Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce DEviS, an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging subjective logic theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable calibrated uncertainty penalty. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>UnsafeBench: Benchmarking Image Safety Classifiers on Real-World and AI-Generated Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of text-to-image models and concerns about their misuse, developers are increasingly relying on image safety classifiers to moderate their generated unsafe images. Yet, the performance of current image safety classifiers remains unknown for both real-world and AI-generated images. In this work, we propose UnsafeBench, a benchmarking framework that evaluates the effectiveness and robustness of image safety classifiers, with a particular focus on the impact of AI-generated images on their performance. First, we curate a large dataset of 10K real-world and AI-generated images that are annotated as safe or unsafe based on a set of 11 unsafe categories of images (sexual, violent, hateful, etc.). Then, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of five popular image safety classifiers, as well as three classifiers that are powered by general-purpose visual language models. Our assessment indicates that existing image safety classifiers are not comprehensive and effective enough to mitigate the multifaceted problem of unsafe images. Also, there exists a distribution shift between real-world and AI-generated images in image qualities, styles, and layouts, leading to degraded effectiveness and robustness. Motivated by these findings, we build a comprehensive image moderation tool called PerspectiveVision, which improves the effectiveness and robustness of existing classifiers, especially on AI-generated images. UnsafeBench and PerspectiveVision can aid the research community in better understanding the landscape of image safety classification in the era of generative AI.</description>

      <title>Sigma Flows for Image and Data Labeling and Learning Structured Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the sigma flow model for the prediction of structured labelings of data observed on Riemannian manifolds, including Euclidean image domains as special case. The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework for image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi about 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by the authors.
  The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic energies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical manifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A specific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the Riemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the approach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this dependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can be learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity of the sigma flow model and prediction performance.
  Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks generated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which highlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the use of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of scientific machine learning.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simplicity and Sophistication using GLinear: A Novel Architecture for Enhanced Time Series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is an important application across many fields. There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, \textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictors (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being data efficient, outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF while being competitive in others. We hope that the proposed GLinear model opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

      <title>SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.</description>

      <title>V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

      <title>Shaken, Not Stirred: A Novel Dataset for Visual Understanding of Glasses in Human-Robot Bartending Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Datasets for object detection often do not account for enough variety of glasses, due to their transparent and reflective properties. Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue for robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. This paper introduces a novel method for acquiring real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset GlassNICOLDataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The dataset consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches. In addition, we deploy our baseline model in an embodied agent approach to the NICOL platform, on which it achieves a success rate of 81% in a human-robot bartending scenario.</description>

      <title>ABS-Mamba: SAM2-Driven Bidirectional Spiral Mamba Network for Medical Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-modal medical image translation requires ha-rmonizing global anatomical semantics and local structural fidelity, a challenge complicated by intermodality information loss and structural distortion. We propose ABS-Mamba, a novel architecture integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for organ-aware semantic representation, specialized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for preserving modality-specific edge and texture details, and Mamba's selective state-space modeling for efficient long- and short-range feature dependencies. Structurally, our dual-resolution framework leverages SAM2's image encoder to capture organ-scale semantics from high-resolution inputs, while a parallel CNNs branch extracts fine-grained local features. The Robust Feature Fusion Network (RFFN) integrates these epresentations, and the Bidirectional Mamba Residual Network (BMRN) models spatial dependencies using spiral scanning and bidirectional state-space dynamics. A three-stage skip fusion decoder enhances edge and texture fidelity. We employ Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA+) fine-tuning to enable precise domain specialization while maintaining the foundational capabilities of the pre-trained components. Extensive experimental validation on the SynthRAD2023 and BraTS2019 datasets demonstrates that ABS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering high-fidelity cross-modal synthesis that preserves anatomical semantics and structural details to enhance diagnostic accuracy in clinical applications.

      <title>Imagine, Verify, Execute: Memory-guided Agentic Exploration with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However, their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute), an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes, predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Spec2VolCAMU-Net: A Spectrogram-to-Volume Model for EEG-to-fMRI Reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) decoders that strain memory and stability. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modelling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings.

      <description>arXiv:2506.24074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial computer vision techniques have the potential to improve the diagnostic performance of colonoscopy. However, the lack of 3D colonoscopy datasets for training and validation hinders their development. This paper introduces C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences totaling 169,371 frames were captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments. Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, diffuse maps, six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage map, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses. Lastly, the dataset includes 15 videos with colon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2 emulates diverse and challenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms, including fecal debris, mucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope lens, en-face views, and fast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2 will allow for more robust and representative development and evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms. Project Page - https://durrlab.github.io/C3VDv2/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis. Our code is available at GitHub.</description>

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries) to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient, next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12 independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20 external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI, IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening) cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).</description>

      <title>Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. Many methods address complex spectral variability; yet large-scale distortions to the scale of the observed pixel signatures due to topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. Because of this, correcting these variations can offer significant advantages in real-world GIS applications. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By estimating and correcting these distortions to the scale of the pixel signatures, the algorithm produces pixel signatures with minimal distortions in scale. Since these distortions in scale (which hinder the performance of many unmixing methods) are greatly minimized in the output provided by the proposed method, the abundance estimation of the unmixing algorithms is significantly improved. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe and correct for scale variability and provide extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a wide range of state-of-the-art unmixing methods on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, achieving error reductions of around 50%, even for algorithms specifically designed to handle spectral variability. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing with existing methods. The algorithm's generality, consistent impact, and significant influence highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</description>

      <title>Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning for Medical Image Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image analysis often faces significant challenges due to limited expert-annotated data, hindering both model generalization and clinical adoption. We propose an expert-guided explainable few-shot learning framework that integrates radiologist-provided regions of interest (ROIs) into model training to simultaneously enhance classification performance and interpretability. Leveraging Grad-CAM for spatial attention supervision, we introduce an explanation loss based on Dice similarity to align model attention with diagnostically relevant regions during training. This explanation loss is jointly optimized with a standard prototypical network objective, encouraging the model to focus on clinically meaningful features even under limited data conditions. We evaluate our framework on two distinct datasets: BraTS (MRI) and VinDr-CXR (Chest X-ray), achieving significant accuracy improvements from 77.09% to 83.61% on BraTS and from 54.33% to 73.29% on VinDr-CXR compared to non-guided models. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirm that expert-guided training consistently aligns attention with diagnostic regions, improving both predictive reliability and clinical trustworthiness. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating expert-guided attention supervision to bridge the gap between performance and interpretability in few-shot medical image diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Adapting Vision-Language Models for Neutrino Event Classification in High-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa 3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events. Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance, interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.</description>
