      <title>PAE: LLM-based Product Attribute Extraction for E-Commerce Fashion Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product attribute extraction is an growing field in e-commerce business, with several applications including product ranking, product recommendation, future assortment planning and improving online shopping customer experiences. Understanding the customer needs is critical part of online business, specifically fashion products. Retailers uses assortment planning to determine the mix of products to offer in each store and channel, stay responsive to market dynamics and to manage inventory and catalogs. The goal is to offer the right styles, in the right sizes and colors, through the right channels. When shoppers find products that meet their needs and desires, they are more likely to return for future purchases, fostering customer loyalty. Product attributes are a key factor in assortment planning. In this paper we present PAE, a product attribute extraction algorithm for future trend reports consisting text and images in PDF format. Most existing methods focus on attribute extraction from titles or product descriptions or utilize visual information from existing product images. Compared to the prior works, our work focuses on attribute extraction from PDF files where upcoming fashion trends are explained. This work proposes a more comprehensive framework that fully utilizes the different modalities for attribute extraction and help retailers to plan the assortment in advance. Our contributions are three-fold: (a) We develop PAE, an efficient framework to extract attributes from unstructured data (text and images); (b) We provide catalog matching methodology based on BERT representations to discover the existing attributes using upcoming attribute values; (c) We conduct extensive experiments with several baselines and show that PAE is an effective, flexible and on par or superior (avg 92.5% F1-Score) framework to existing state-of-the-art for attribute value extraction task.</description>

      <title>BIOSCAN-CLIP: Bridging Vision and Genomics for Biodiversity Monitoring at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring biodiversity is crucial for understanding ecosystem health. While prior works have developed machine learning models for the taxonomic classification of photographic images and DNA separately, in this work, we introduce a multimodal approach combining both, using CLIP-style contrastive learning to align images, DNA barcodes, and textual data in a unified embedding space. This allows for accurate classification of both known and unknown insect species without task-specific fine-tuning, leveraging contrastive learning for the first time to fuse DNA and image data. Our method surpasses previous single-modality approaches in accuracy by over 11% on zero-shot learning tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in biodiversity studies.</description>

      <title>BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Here, we develop BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent achieves an average of 18% improvement in detecting desired phenotypes across five datasets, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' capabilities.</description>

      <title>The Economic Implications of Large Language Model Selection on Earnings and Return on Investment: A Decision Theoretic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting language models in business contexts requires a careful analysis of the final financial benefits of the investment. However, the emphasis of academia and industry analysis of LLM is solely on performance. This work introduces a framework to evaluate LLMs, focusing on the earnings and return on investment aspects that should be taken into account in business decision making. We use a decision-theoretic approach to compare the financial impact of different LLMs, considering variables such as the cost per token, the probability of success in the specific task, and the gain and losses associated with LLMs use. The study reveals how the superior accuracy of more expensive models can, under certain conditions, justify a greater investment through more significant earnings but not necessarily a larger RoI. This article provides a framework for companies looking to optimize their technology choices, ensuring that investment in cutting-edge technology aligns with strategic financial objectives. In addition, we discuss how changes in operational variables influence the economics of using LLMs, offering practical insights for enterprise settings, finding that the predicted gain and loss and the different probabilities of success and failure are the variables that most impact the sensitivity of the models.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Enhanced Decision-Making for Autonomous Agents in Dynamic and Partially Observable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents, whether software or hardware, perceive their environment through sensors and act using actuators, often operating in dynamic, partially observable settings. They face challenges like incomplete and noisy data, unforeseen situations, and the need to adapt goals in real-time. Traditional reasoning and ML methods, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), help but are limited by data needs, predefined goals, and extensive exploration periods. Ontologies offer a solution by integrating diverse information sources, enhancing decision-making in complex environments. This thesis introduces an ontology-enhanced decision-making model (OntoDeM) for autonomous agents. OntoDeM enriches agents' domain knowledge, allowing them to interpret unforeseen events, generate or adapt goals, and make better decisions. Key contributions include: 1. An ontology-based method to improve agents' real-time observations using prior knowledge. 2. The OntoDeM model for handling dynamic, unforeseen situations by evolving or generating new goals. 3. Implementation and evaluation in four real-world applications, demonstrating its effectiveness. Compared to traditional and advanced learning algorithms, OntoDeM shows superior performance in improving agents' observations and decision-making in dynamic, partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Video Enriched Retrieval Augmented Generation Using Aligned Video Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the use of "aligned visual captions" as a mechanism for integrating information contained within videos into retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based chat assistant systems. These captions are able to describe the visual and audio content of videos in a large corpus while having the advantage of being in a textual format that is both easy to reason about &amp; incorporate into large language model (LLM) prompts, but also typically require less multimedia content to be inserted into the multimodal LLM context window, where typical configurations can aggressively fill up the context window by sampling video frames from the source video. Furthermore, visual captions can be adapted to specific use cases by prompting the original foundational model / captioner for particular visual details or fine tuning. In hopes of helping advancing progress in this area, we curate a dataset and describe automatic evaluation procedures on common RAG tasks.</description>

      <title>AI Alignment with Changing and Influenceable Reward Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing AI alignment approaches assume that preferences are static, which is unrealistic: our preferences change, and may even be influenced by our interactions with AI systems themselves. To clarify the consequences of incorrectly assuming static preferences, we introduce Dynamic Reward Markov Decision Processes (DR-MDPs), which explicitly model preference changes and the AI's influence on them. We show that despite its convenience, the static-preference assumption may undermine the soundness of existing alignment techniques, leading them to implicitly reward AI systems for influencing user preferences in ways users may not truly want. We then explore potential solutions. First, we offer a unifying perspective on how an agent's optimization horizon may partially help reduce undesirable AI influence. Then, we formalize different notions of AI alignment that account for preference change from the outset. Comparing the strengths and limitations of 8 such notions of alignment, we find that they all either err towards causing undesirable AI influence, or are overly risk-averse, suggesting that a straightforward solution to the problems of changing preferences may not exist. As there is no avoiding grappling with changing preferences in real-world settings, this makes it all the more important to handle these issues with care, balancing risks and capabilities. We hope our work can provide conceptual clarity and constitute a first step towards AI alignment practices which explicitly account for (and contend with) the changing and influenceable nature of human preferences.</description>

      <title>ClavaDDPM: Multi-relational Data Synthesis with Cluster-guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in tabular data synthesis has focused on single tables, whereas real-world applications often involve complex data with tens or hundreds of interconnected tables. Previous approaches to synthesizing multi-relational (multi-table) data fall short in two key aspects: scalability for larger datasets and capturing long-range dependencies, such as correlations between attributes spread across different tables. Inspired by the success of diffusion models in tabular data modeling, we introduce
  $\textbf{C}luster$ $\textbf{La}tent$ $\textbf{Va}riable$ $guided$ $\textbf{D}enoising$ $\textbf{D}iffusion$ $\textbf{P}robabilistic$ $\textbf{M}odels$ (ClavaDDPM). This novel approach leverages clustering labels as intermediaries to model relationships between tables, specifically focusing on foreign key constraints. ClavaDDPM leverages the robust generation capabilities of diffusion models while incorporating efficient algorithms to propagate the learned latent variables across tables. This enables ClavaDDPM to capture long-range dependencies effectively.
  Extensive evaluations on multi-table datasets of varying sizes show that ClavaDDPM significantly outperforms existing methods for these long-range dependencies while remaining competitive on utility metrics for single-table data.</description>

      <title>The Widening Gap: The Benefits and Harms of Generative AI for Novice Programmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novice programmers often struggle through programming problem solving due to a lack of metacognitive awareness and strategies. Previous research has shown that novices can encounter multiple metacognitive difficulties while programming. Novices are typically unaware of how these difficulties are hindering their progress. Meanwhile, many novices are now programming with generative AI (GenAI), which can provide complete solutions to most introductory programming problems, code suggestions, hints for next steps when stuck, and explain cryptic error messages. Its impact on novice metacognition has only started to be explored. Here we replicate a previous study that examined novice programming problem solving behavior and extend it by incorporating GenAI tools. Through 21 lab sessions consisting of participant observation, interview, and eye tracking, we explore how novices are coding with GenAI tools. Although 20 of 21 students completed the assigned programming problem, our findings show an unfortunate divide in the use of GenAI tools between students who accelerated and students who struggled. Students who accelerated were able to use GenAI to create code they already intended to make and were able to ignore unhelpful or incorrect inline code suggestions. But for students who struggled, our findings indicate that previously known metacognitive difficulties persist, and that GenAI unfortunately can compound them and even introduce new metacognitive difficulties. Furthermore, struggling students often expressed cognitive dissonance about their problem solving ability, thought they performed better than they did, and finished with an illusion of competence. Based on our observations from both groups, we propose ways to scaffold the novice GenAI experience and make suggestions for future work.</description>

      <title>LoRA-Switch: Boosting the Efficiency of Dynamic LLM Adapters via System-Algorithm Co-design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent literature has found that an effective method to customize or further improve large language models (LLMs) is to add dynamic adapters, such as low-rank adapters (LoRA) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structures. Though such dynamic adapters incur modest computational complexity, they surprisingly lead to huge inference latency overhead, slowing down the decoding speed by 2.5+ times. In this paper, we analyze the fine-grained costs of the dynamic adapters and find that the fragmented CUDA kernel calls are the root cause. Therefore, we propose LoRA-Switch, a system-algorithm co-designed architecture for efficient dynamic adapters. Unlike most existing dynamic structures that adopt layer-wise or block-wise dynamic routing, LoRA-Switch introduces a token-wise routing mechanism. It switches the LoRA adapters and weights for each token and merges them into the backbone for inference. For efficiency, this switching is implemented with an optimized CUDA kernel, which fuses the merging operations for all LoRA adapters at once. Based on experiments with popular open-source LLMs on common benchmarks, our approach has demonstrated similar accuracy improvement as existing dynamic adapters, while reducing the decoding latency by more than 2.4 times.</description>

      <title>Getting More Juice Out of the SFT Data: Reward Learning from Human Demonstration Improves SFT for LLM Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. State-of-the-art techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often consist of two stages: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the model is fine-tuned by learning from human demonstration data; 2) Preference learning, where preference data is used to learn a reward model, which is in turn used by a reinforcement learning (RL) step to fine-tune the model. Such reward model serves as a proxy to human preference, and it is critical to guide the RL step towards improving the model quality. In this work, we argue that the SFT stage significantly benefits from learning a reward model as well. Instead of using the human demonstration data directly via supervised learning, we propose to leverage an Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique to (explicitly or implicitly) build an reward model, while learning the policy model. This approach leads to new SFT algorithms that are not only efficient to implement, but also promote the ability to distinguish between the preferred and non-preferred continuations. Moreover, we identify a connection between the proposed IRL based approach, and certain self-play approach proposed recently, and showed that self-play is a special case of modeling a reward-learning agent. Theoretically, we show that the proposed algorithms converge to the stationary solutions of the IRL problem. Empirically, we align 1B and 7B models using proposed methods and evaluate them on a reward benchmark model and the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard. The proposed methods show significant performance improvement over existing SFT approaches. Our results indicate that it is beneficial to explicitly or implicitly leverage reward learning throughout the entire alignment process.</description>

      <title>Boosting Protein Language Models with Negative Sample Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a pioneering methodology for boosting large language models in the domain of protein representation learning. Our primary contribution lies in the refinement process for correlating the over-reliance on co-evolution knowledge, in a way that networks are trained to distill invaluable insights from negative samples, constituted by protein pairs sourced from disparate categories. By capitalizing on this novel approach, our technique steers the training of transformer-based models within the attention score space. This advanced strategy not only amplifies performance but also reflects the nuanced biological behaviors exhibited by proteins, offering aligned evidence with traditional biological mechanisms such as protein-protein interaction. We experimentally observed improved performance on various tasks over datasets, on top of several well-established large protein models. This innovative paradigm opens up promising horizons for further progress in the realms of protein research and computational biology.</description>

      <title>Human-Cobot collaboration's impact on success, time completion, errors, workload, gestures and acceptability during an assembly task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5.0 industry promotes collaborative robots (cobots). This research studies the impacts of cobot collaboration using an experimental setup. 120 participants realized a simple and a complex assembly task. 50% collaborated with another human (H/H) and 50% with a cobot (H/C). The workload and the acceptability of the cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a cobot in production chains.</description>

      <title>Towards Clinical AI Fairness: Filling Gaps in the Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ethical integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare necessitates addressing fairness-a concept that is highly context-specific across medical fields. Extensive studies have been conducted to expand the technical components of AI fairness, while tremendous calls for AI fairness have been raised from healthcare. Despite this, a significant disconnect persists between technical advancements and their practical clinical applications, resulting in a lack of contextualized discussion of AI fairness in clinical settings. Through a detailed evidence gap analysis, our review systematically pinpoints several deficiencies concerning both healthcare data and the provided AI fairness solutions. We highlight the scarcity of research on AI fairness in many medical domains where AI technology is increasingly utilized. Additionally, our analysis highlights a substantial reliance on group fairness, aiming to ensure equality among demographic groups from a macro healthcare system perspective; in contrast, individual fairness, focusing on equity at a more granular level, is frequently overlooked. To bridge these gaps, our review advances actionable strategies for both the healthcare and AI research communities. Beyond applying existing AI fairness methods in healthcare, we further emphasize the importance of involving healthcare professionals to refine AI fairness concepts and methods to ensure contextually relevant and ethically sound AI applications in healthcare.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Multimodal Model Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work uniquely identifies and characterizes four prevalent multimodal model architectural patterns in the contemporary multimodal landscape. Systematically categorizing models by architecture type facilitates monitoring of developments in the multimodal domain. Distinct from recent survey papers that present general information on multimodal architectures, this research conducts a comprehensive exploration of architectural details and identifies four specific architectural types. The types are distinguished by their respective methodologies for integrating multimodal inputs into the deep neural network model. The first two types (Type A and B) deeply fuses multimodal inputs within the internal layers of the model, whereas the following two types (Type C and D) facilitate early fusion at the input stage. Type-A employs standard cross-attention, whereas Type-B utilizes custom-designed layers for modality fusion within the internal layers. On the other hand, Type-C utilizes modality-specific encoders, while Type-D leverages tokenizers to process the modalities at the model's input stage. The identified architecture types aid the monitoring of any-to-any multimodal model development. Notably, Type-C and Type-D are currently favored in the construction of any-to-any multimodal models. Type-C, distinguished by its non-tokenizing multimodal model architecture, is emerging as a viable alternative to Type-D, which utilizes input-tokenizing techniques. To assist in model selection, this work highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each architecture type based on data and compute requirements, architecture complexity, scalability, simplification of adding modalities, training objectives, and any-to-any multimodal generation capability.</description>

      <title>Proof of Quality: A Costless Paradigm for Trustless Generative AI Model Inference on Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated powerful and disruptive capabilities in natural language and image tasks. However, deploying these models in decentralized environments remains challenging. Unlike traditional centralized deployment, systematically guaranteeing the integrity of AI model services in fully decentralized environments, particularly on trustless blockchains, is both crucial and difficult. In this paper, we present a new inference paradigm called \emph{proof of quality} (PoQ) to enable the deployment of arbitrarily large generative models on blockchain architecture. Unlike traditional approaches based on validating inference procedures, such as ZKML or OPML, our PoQ paradigm focuses on the outcome quality of model inference. Using lightweight BERT-based cross-encoders as our underlying quality evaluation model, we design and implement PQML, the first practical protocol for real-world NLP generative model inference on blockchains, tailored for popular open-source models such as Llama 3 and Mixtral. Our analysis demonstrates that our protocol is robust against adversarial but rational participants in ecosystems, where lazy or dishonest behavior results in fewer benefits compared to well-behaving participants. The computational overhead of validating the quality evaluation is minimal, allowing quality validators to complete the quality check within a second, even using only a CPU. Preliminary simulation results show that PoQ consensus is generated in milliseconds, 1,000 times faster than any existing scheme.</description>

      <title>Self-Guiding Exploration for Combinatorial Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in addressing reasoning tasks across diverse domains, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. They utilize prompting techniques such as Exploration-of-Thought, Decomposition, and Refinement to effectively navigate and solve intricate tasks. Despite these advancements, the application of LLMs to Combinatorial Problems (CPs), known for their NP-hardness and critical roles in logistics and resource management remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel prompting strategy: Self-Guiding Exploration (SGE), designed to enhance the performance of solving CPs. SGE operates autonomously, generating multiple thought trajectories for each CP task. It then breaks these trajectories down into actionable subtasks, executes them sequentially, and refines the results to ensure optimal outcomes. We present our research as the first to apply LLMs to a broad range of CPs and demonstrate that SGE outperforms existing prompting strategies by over 27.84% in CP optimization performance. Additionally, SGE achieves a 2.46% higher accuracy over the best existing results in other reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Preference Optimization: Augmenting Direct Preference Optimization with Auxiliary Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For aligning large language models (LLMs), prior work has leveraged reinforcement learning via human feedback (RLHF) or variations of direct preference optimization (DPO). While DPO offers a simpler framework based on maximum likelihood estimation, it compromises on the ability to tune language models to easily maximize non-differentiable and non-binary objectives according to the LLM designer's preferences (e.g., using simpler language or minimizing specific kinds of harmful content). These may neither align with user preferences nor even be able to be captured tractably by binary preference data. To leverage the simplicity and performance of DPO with the generalizability of RL, we propose a hybrid approach between DPO and RLHF. With a simple augmentation to the implicit reward decomposition of DPO, we allow for tuning LLMs to maximize a set of arbitrary auxiliary rewards using offline RL. The proposed method, Hybrid Preference Optimization (HPO), shows the ability to effectively generalize to both user preferences and auxiliary designer objectives, while preserving alignment performance across a range of challenging benchmarks and model sizes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yuan 2.0-M32, with a similar base architecture as Yuan-2.0 2B, uses a mixture-of-experts architecture with 32 experts of which 2 experts are active. A new router network, Attention Router, is proposed and adopted for a more efficient selection of experts, which boosts the accuracy of 3.8% compared to the model with classical router network. Yuan 2.0-M32 is trained with 2000B tokens from scratch, and the training computation consumption is only 9.25% of a dense model at the same parameter scale. Yuan 2.0-M32 demonstrates competitive capability on coding, math, and various domains of expertise, with only 3.7B active parameters of 40B in total, and 7.4 GFlops forward computation per token, both of which are only 1/19 of Llama3-70B. Yuan 2.0-M32 surpass Llama3-70B on MATH and ARC-Challenge benchmark, with accuracy of 55.89 and 95.8 respectively. The models and source codes of Yuan 2.0-M32 are released at Github.</description>

      <title>Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multi-modal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities. However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\%, 0.9\%, and 2.3\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\% faster inference and 83.7\% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.</description>

      <title>On Creativity and Open-Endedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Life (ALife) as an interdisciplinary field draws inspiration and influence from a variety of perspectives. Scientific progress crucially depends, then, on concerted efforts to invite cross-disciplinary dialogue. The goal of this paper is to revitalize discussions of potential connections between the fields of Computational Creativity (CC) and ALife, focusing specifically on the concept of Open-Endedness (OE); the primary goal of CC is to endow artificial systems with creativity, and ALife has dedicated much research effort into studying and synthesizing OE and artificial innovation. However, despite the close proximity of these concepts, their use so far remains confined to their respective communities, and their relationship is largely unclear. We provide historical context for research in both domains, and review the limited work connecting research on creativity and OE explicitly. We then highlight specific questions to be considered, with the eventual goals of (i) decreasing conceptual ambiguity by highlighting similarities and differences between the concepts of OE, (ii) identifying synergy effects of a research agenda that encompasses both OE and creativity, and (iii) establishing a dialogue between ALife and CC research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When data on building features is unavailable, the task of determining how to improve that building in terms of carbon emissions becomes infeasible. We show that from only a set of images, a Large Language Model with appropriate prompt engineering and domain knowledge can successfully estimate a range of building features relevant for sustainability calculations. We compare our novel image-to-data method with a ground truth comprising real building data for 47 apartments and achieve accuracy better than a human performing the same task. We also demonstrate that the method can generate tailored recommendations to the owner on how best to improve their properties and discuss methods to scale the approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Dialogues for Joint Human-AI Reasoning and Value Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that enabling human-AI dialogue, purposed to support joint reasoning (i.e., 'inquiry'), is important for ensuring that AI decision making is aligned with human values and preferences. In particular, we point to logic-based models of argumentation and dialogue, and suggest that the traditional focus on persuasion dialogues be replaced by a focus on inquiry dialogues, and the distinct challenges that joint inquiry raises. Given recent dramatic advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs), and the anticipated increase in their use for decision making, we provide a roadmap for research into inquiry dialogues for supporting joint human-LLM reasoning tasks that are ethically salient, and that thereby require that decisions are value aligned.</description>

      <title>LLM experiments with simulation: Large Language Model Multi-Agent System for Process Simulation Parametrization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of a multi-agent system framework that applies a large language model (LLM) to automate the parametrization of process simulations in digital twins. We propose a multi-agent framework that includes four types of agents: observation, reasoning, decision and summarization. By enabling dynamic interaction between LLM agents and simulation model, the developed system can automatically explore the parametrization of the simulation and use heuristic reasoning to determine a set of parameters to control the simulation to achieve an objective. The proposed approach enhances the simulation model by infusing it with heuristics from LLM and enables autonomous search for feasible parametrization to solve a user task. Furthermore, the system has the potential to increase user-friendliness and reduce the cognitive load on human users by assisting in complex decision-making processes. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated through a case study, and the visualized demos are available at a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLMDrivenSimulation</description>

      <title>A Unified Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Model Towards Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has two settings: interpolation reasoning and extrapolation reasoning. Both of them draw plenty of research interest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the temporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter require strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues provided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG applications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed specifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an original Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning fashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data and with fine interpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms SOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the extrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to evaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. More diverse experiments are conducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.</description>

      <title>An approach to improve agent learning via guaranteeing goal reaching in all episodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is commonly concerned with problems of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes. Oftentimes, a certain goal state or a subset of the state space attain maximal reward. In such a case, the environment may be considered solved when the goal is reached. Whereas numerous techniques, learning or non-learning based, exist for solving environments, doing so optimally is the biggest challenge. Say, one may choose a reward rate which penalizes the action effort. Reinforcement learning is currently among the most actively developed frameworks for solving environments optimally by virtue of maximizing accumulated reward, in other words, returns. Yet, tuning agents is a notoriously hard task as reported in a series of works. Our aim here is to help the agent learn a near-optimal policy efficiently while ensuring a goal reaching property of some basis policy that merely solves the environment. We suggest an algorithm, which is fairly flexible, and can be used to augment practically any agent as long as it comprises of a critic. A formal proof of a goal reaching property is provided. Simulation experiments on six problems under five agents, including the benchmarked one, provided an empirical evidence that the learning can indeed be boosted while ensuring goal reaching property.</description>

Abstract: Modern Tabletop Games present various interesting challenges for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning. In this paper, we introduce PyTAG, a new framework that supports interacting with a large collection of games implemented in the Tabletop Games framework. In this work we highlight the challenges tabletop games provide, from a game-playing agent perspective, along with the opportunities they provide for future research. Additionally, we highlight the technical challenges that involve training Reinforcement Learning agents on these games. To explore the Multi-agent setting provided by PyTAG we train the popular Proximal Policy Optimisation Reinforcement Learning algorithm using self-play on a subset of games and evaluate the trained policies against some simple agents and Monte-Carlo Tree Search implemented in the Tabletop Games framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A career is a crucial aspect for any person to fulfill their desires through hard work. During their studies, students cannot find the best career suggestions unless they receive meaningful guidance tailored to their skills. Therefore, we developed an AI-assisted model for early prediction to provide better career suggestions. Although the task is difficult, proper guidance can make it easier. Effective career guidance requires understanding a student's academic skills, interests, and skill-related activities. In this research, we collected essential information from Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SWE) students to train a machine learning (ML) model that predicts career paths based on students' career-related information. To adequately train the models, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and completed dataset pre-processing. For comparative analysis, we utilized multiple classification ML algorithms and deep learning (DL) algorithms. This study contributes valuable insights to educational advising by providing specific career suggestions based on the unique features of CS and SWE students. Additionally, the research helps individual CS and SWE students find suitable jobs that match their skills, interests, and skill-related activities.</description>

      <title>Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via Layer-specific Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in a wide range of real-world applications. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial prompts even when aligned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or supervised fine-tuning. While existing defense methods focus on either detecting harmful prompts or reducing the likelihood of harmful responses through various means, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks based on the inner mechanisms of LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs response to harmful prompts and propose a novel defense method termed \textbf{L}ayer-specific \textbf{Ed}iting (LED) to enhance the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Through LED, we reveal that several critical \textit{safety layers} exist among the early layers of LLMs. We then show that realigning these safety layers (and some selected additional layers) with the decoded safe response from selected target layers can significantly improve the alignment of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments across various LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Mistral) show the effectiveness of LED, which effectively defends against jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign prompts.

      <description>arXiv:2405.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowering safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents during training is a critical impediment towards deploying RL agents in many real-world scenarios. Training RL agents in unknown, black-box environments poses an even greater safety risk when prior knowledge of the domain/task is unavailable. We introduce ADVICE (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, thus protecting the RL agent from executing actions that yield potentially hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques demonstrates how ADVICE can significantly reduce safety violations during training while maintaining a competitive outcome reward.</description>

      <title>A Human-Like Reasoning Framework for Multi-Phases Planning Task with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted their proficiency in some simple tasks like writing and coding through various reasoning strategies. However, LLM agents still struggle with tasks that require comprehensive planning, a process that challenges current models and remains a critical research issue. In this study, we concentrate on travel planning, a Multi-Phases planning problem, that involves multiple interconnected stages, such as outlining, information gathering, and planning, often characterized by the need to manage various constraints and uncertainties. Existing reasoning approaches have struggled to effectively address this complex task. Our research aims to address this challenge by developing a human-like planning framework for LLM agents, i.e., guiding the LLM agent to simulate various steps that humans take when solving Multi-Phases problems. Specifically, we implement several strategies to enable LLM agents to generate a coherent outline for each travel query, mirroring human planning patterns. Additionally, we integrate Strategy Block and Knowledge Block into our framework: Strategy Block facilitates information collection, while Knowledge Block provides essential information for detailed planning. Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the planning capabilities of LLM agents, enabling them to tackle the travel planning task with improved efficiency and effectiveness. Our experimental results showcase the exceptional performance of the proposed framework; when combined with GPT-4-Turbo, it attains $10\times$ the performance gains in comparison to the baseline framework deployed on GPT-4-Turbo.</description>

      <title>Utilitarian Algorithm Configuration for Infinite Parameter Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration is a general-purpose technique for automatically searching the parameter space of a given algorithm to optimize its performance, as measured by a given utility function, on a given set of inputs. Recently introduced utilitarian configuration procedures offer optimality guarantees about the returned parameterization while provably adapting to the hardness of the underlying problem. However, the applicability of these approaches is severely limited by the fact that they only search a finite, relatively small set of parameters. They cannot effectively search the configuration space of algorithms with continuous or uncountable parameters. In this paper we introduce a new procedure, which we dub COUP (Continuous, Optimistic Utilitarian Procrastination). COUP is designed to search infinite parameter spaces efficiently to find good configurations quickly. Furthermore, COUP maintains the theoretical benefits of previous utilitarian configuration procedures when applied to finite parameter spaces but is significantly faster, both provably and experimentally.</description>

      <title>Extreme Value Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being successful in board games and reinforcement learning (RL), UCT, a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) combined with UCB1 Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB), has had limited success in domain-independent planning until recently. Previous work showed that UCB1, designed for $[0,1]$-bounded rewards, is not appropriate for estimating the distance-to-go which are potentially unbounded in $\mathbb{R}$, such as heuristic functions used in classical planning, then proposed combining MCTS with MABs designed for Gaussian reward distributions and successfully improved the performance. In this paper, we further sharpen our understanding of ideal bandits for planning tasks. Existing work has two issues: First, while Gaussian MABs no longer over-specify the distances as $h\in [0,1]$, they under-specify them as $h\in [-\infty,\infty]$ while they are non-negative and can be further bounded in some cases. Second, there is no theoretical justifications for Full-Bellman backup (Schulte &amp; Keller, 2014) that backpropagates minimum/maximum of samples. We identified \emph{extreme value} statistics as a theoretical framework that resolves both issues at once and propose two bandits, UCB1-Uniform/Power, and apply them to MCTS for classical planning. We formally prove their regret bounds and empirically demonstrate their performance in classical planning.</description>

      <title>Metaheuristics and Large Language Models Join Forces: Towards an Integrated Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) a couple of years ago, researchers in metaheuristics (MHs) have wondered how to use their power in a beneficial way within their algorithms. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages LLMs as pattern recognition tools to improve MHs. The resulting hybrid method, tested in the context of a social network-based combinatorial optimization problem, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with MHs regarding the obtained solution quality. By carefully designing prompts, we demonstrate that the output obtained from LLMs can be used as problem knowledge, leading to improved results. Lastly, we acknowledge LLMs' potential drawbacks and limitations and consider it essential to examine them to advance this type of research further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training an agent to adapt to specific tasks through co-optimization of morphology and control has widely attracted attention. However, whether there exists an optimal configuration and tactics for agents in a multiagent competition scenario is still an issue that is challenging to definitively conclude. In this context, we propose competitive evolution (CompetEvo), which co-evolves agents' designs and tactics in confrontation. We build arenas consisting of three animals and their evolved derivatives, placing agents with different morphologies in direct competition with each other. The results reveal that our method enables agents to evolve a more suitable design and strategy for fighting compared to fixed-morph agents, allowing them to obtain advantages in combat scenarios. Moreover, we demonstrate the amazing and impressive behaviors that emerge when confrontations are conducted under asymmetrical morphs.</description>

      <title>DSDL: Data Set Description Language for Bridging Modalities and Tasks in AI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of artificial intelligence, the diversity of data modalities and annotation formats often renders data unusable directly, requiring understanding and format conversion before it can be used by researchers or developers with different needs. To tackle this problem, this article introduces a framework called Dataset Description Language (DSDL) that aims to simplify dataset processing by providing a unified standard for AI datasets. DSDL adheres to the three basic practical principles of generic, portable, and extensible, using a unified standard to express data of different modalities and structures, facilitating the dissemination of AI data, and easily extending to new modalities and tasks. The standardized specifications of DSDL reduce the workload for users in data dissemination, processing, and usage. To further improve user convenience, we provide predefined DSDL templates for various tasks, convert mainstream datasets to comply with DSDL specifications, and provide comprehensive documentation and DSDL tools. These efforts aim to simplify the use of AI data, thereby improving the efficiency of AI development.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Clinical Documentation: Harnessing Generative AI for Patient-Centric Clinical Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehensive clinical documentation is crucial for effective healthcare delivery, yet it poses a significant burden on healthcare professionals, leading to burnout, increased medical errors, and compromised patient safety. This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.</description>

      <title>LLaMA-NAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in solving natural language processing, complex reasoning, sentiment analysis and other tasks have been extraordinary which has prompted their extensive adoption. Unfortunately, these abilities come with very high memory and computational costs which precludes the use of LLMs on most hardware platforms. To mitigate this, we propose an effective method of finding Pareto-optimal network architectures based on LLaMA2-7B using one-shot NAS. In particular, we fine-tune LLaMA2-7B only once and then apply genetic algorithm-based search to find smaller, less computationally complex network architectures. We show that, for certain standard benchmark tasks, the pre-trained LLaMA2-7B network is unnecessarily large and complex. More specifically, we demonstrate a 1.5x reduction in model size and 1.3x speedup in throughput for certain tasks with negligible drop in accuracy. In addition to finding smaller, higher-performing network architectures, our method does so more effectively and efficiently than certain pruning or sparsification techniques. Finally, we demonstrate how quantization is complementary to our method and that the size and complexity of the networks we find can be further decreased using quantization. We believe that our work provides a way to automatically create LLMs which can be used on less expensive and more readily available hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>DefSent+: Improving sentence embeddings of language models by projecting definition sentences into a quasi-isotropic or isotropic vector space of unlimited dictionary entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a significant improvement on the previous conference paper known as DefSent. The prior study seeks to improve sentence embeddings of language models by projecting definition sentences into the vector space of dictionary entries. We discover that this approach is not fully explored due to the methodological limitation of using word embeddings of language models to represent dictionary entries. This leads to two hindrances. First, dictionary entries are constrained by the single-word vocabulary, and thus cannot be fully exploited. Second, semantic representations of language models are known to be anisotropic, but pre-processing word embeddings for DefSent is not allowed because its weight is frozen during training and tied to the prediction layer. In this paper, we propose a novel method to progressively build entry embeddings not subject to the limitations. As a result, definition sentences can be projected into a quasi-isotropic or isotropic vector space of unlimited dictionary entries, so that sentence embeddings of noticeably better quality are attainable. We abbreviate our approach as DefSent+ (a plus version of DefSent), involving the following strengths: 1) the task performance on measuring sentence similarities is significantly improved compared to DefSent; 2) when DefSent+ is used to further train data-augmented models like SIMCSE and SNCSE, state-of-the-art performance on measuring sentence similarities can be achieved among the approaches without using manually labeled datasets; 3) DefSent+ is also competitive in feature-based transfer for NLP downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Hybrid Resource Allocation in MEC-assisted RAN Slicing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to maximize the SSR for heterogeneous service demands in the cooperative MEC-assisted RAN slicing system by jointly considering the multi-node computing resources cooperation and allocation, the transmission resource blocks (RBs) allocation, and the time-varying dynamicity of the system. To this end, we abstract the system into a weighted undirected topology graph and, then propose a recurrent graph reinforcement learning (RGRL) algorithm to intelligently learn the optimal hybrid RA policy. Therein, the graph neural network (GCN) and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is combined to effectively extract spatial features from the equivalent topology graph. Furthermore, a novel time recurrent reinforcement learning framework is designed in the proposed RGRL algorithm by incorporating the action output of the policy network at the previous moment into the state input of the policy network at the subsequent moment, so as to cope with the time-varying and contextual network environment. In addition, we explore two use case scenarios to discuss the universal superiority of the proposed RGRL algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of the average SSR, the performance stability, and the network complexity.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Tool Compiler for Fused Parallel Function Calling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art sequential reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded the capabilities of Copilots beyond conversational tasks to complex function calling, managing thousands of API calls. However, the tendency of compositional prompting to segment tasks into multiple steps, each requiring a round-trip to the GPT APIs, leads to increased system latency and costs. Although recent advancements in parallel function calling have improved tool execution per API call, they may necessitate more detailed in-context instructions and task breakdown at the prompt level, resulting in higher engineering and production costs. Inspired by the hardware design principles of multiply-add (MAD) operations, which fuse multiple arithmetic operations into a single task from the compiler's perspective, we propose LLM-Tool Compiler, which selectively fuses similar types of tool operations under a single function at runtime, presenting them as a unified task to the LLM. This selective fusion inherently enhances parallelization and efficiency. Benchmarked on a large-scale Copilot platform, LLM-Tool Compiler achieves up to four times more parallel calls than existing methods, reducing token costs and latency by up to 40% and 12%, respectively.</description>

      <title>When Large Language Models Meet Optical Networks: Paving the Way for Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have brought about revolutionary advancements in all walks of life. As a superior natural language processing (NLP) technology, LLMs have consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous areas. However, LLMs are considered to be general-purpose models for NLP tasks, which may encounter challenges when applied to complex tasks in specialized fields such as optical networks. In this study, we propose a framework of LLM-empowered optical networks, facilitating intelligent control of the physical layer and efficient interaction with the application layer through an LLM-driven agent (AI-Agent) deployed in the control layer. The AI-Agent can leverage external tools and extract domain knowledge from a comprehensive resource library specifically established for optical networks. This is achieved through user input and well-crafted prompts, enabling the generation of control instructions and result representations for autonomous operation and maintenance in optical networks. To improve LLM's capability in professional fields and stimulate its potential on complex tasks, the details of performing prompt engineering, establishing domain knowledge library, and implementing complex tasks are illustrated in this study. Moreover, the proposed framework is verified on two typical tasks: network alarm analysis and network performance optimization. The good response accuracies and sematic similarities of 2,400 test situations exhibit the great potential of LLM in optical networks.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning for Accurate IoT Device Identification in Dynamic Wireless Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying IoT devices is crucial for network monitoring, security enforcement, and inventory tracking. However, most existing identification methods rely on deep packet inspection, which raises privacy concerns and adds computational complexity. More importantly, existing works overlook the impact of wireless channel dynamics on the accuracy of layer-2 features, thereby limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. In this work, we define and use the latency of specific probe-response packet exchanges, referred to as "device latency," as the main feature for device identification. Additionally, we reveal the critical impact of wireless channel dynamics on the accuracy of device identification based on device latency. Specifically, this work introduces "accumulation score" as a novel approach to capturing fine-grained channel dynamics and their impact on device latency when training machine learning models. We implement the proposed methods and measure the accuracy and overhead of device identification in real-world scenarios. The results confirm that by incorporating the accumulation score for balanced data collection and training machine learning algorithms, we achieve an F1 score of over 97% for device identification, even amidst wireless channel dynamics, a significant improvement over the 75% F1 score achieved by disregarding the impact of channel dynamics on data collection and device latency.</description>

      <title>Green AI in Action: Strategic Model Selection for Ensembles in Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into software systems has significantly enhanced their capabilities while escalating energy demands. Ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models to form a single prediction, intensifies this problem due to cumulative energy consumption. This paper presents a novel approach to model selection that addresses the challenge of balancing the accuracy of AI models with their energy consumption in a live AI ensemble system. We explore how reducing the number of models or improving the efficiency of model usage within an ensemble during inference can reduce energy demands without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This study introduces and evaluates two model selection strategies, Static and Dynamic, for optimizing ensemble learning systems performance while minimizing energy usage. Our results demonstrate that the Static strategy improves the F1 score beyond the baseline, reducing average energy usage from 100\% from the full ensemble to 6\2%. The Dynamic strategy further enhances F1 scores, using on average 76\% compared to 100% of the full ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach that balances accuracy with resource consumption, significantly reducing energy usage without substantially impacting accuracy. This method decreased the average energy usage of the Static strategy from approximately 62\% to 14\%, and for the Dynamic strategy, from around 76\% to 57\%. Our field study of Green AI using an operational AI system developed by a large professional services provider shows the practical applicability of adopting energy-conscious model selection strategies in live production environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation (xG) wireless networks, with their complex and dynamic nature, present significant challenges to using traditional optimization techniques. Generative AI (GAI) emerges as a powerful tool due to its unique strengths. Unlike traditional optimization techniques and other machine learning methods, GAI excels at learning from real-world network data, capturing its intricacies. This enables safe, offline exploration of various configurations and generation of diverse, unseen scenarios, empowering proactive, data-driven exploration and optimization for xG networks. Additionally, GAI's scalability makes it ideal for large-scale xG networks. This paper surveys how GAI-based models unlock optimization opportunities in xG wireless networks. We begin by providing a review of GAI models and some of the major communication paradigms of xG (e.g., 6G) wireless networks. We then delve into exploring how GAI can be used to improve resource allocation and enhance overall network performance. Additionally, we briefly review the networking requirements for supporting GAI applications in xG wireless networks. The paper further discusses the key challenges and future research directions in leveraging GAI for network optimization. Finally, a case study demonstrates the application of a diffusion-based GAI model for load balancing, carrier aggregation, and backhauling optimization in non-terrestrial networks, a core technology of xG networks. This case study serves as a practical example of how the combination of reinforcement learning and GAI can be implemented to address real-world network optimization problems.</description>

      <title>WeatherFormer: A Pretrained Encoder Model for Learning Robust Weather Representations from Small Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WeatherFormer, a transformer encoder-based model designed to learn robust weather features from minimal observations. It addresses the challenge of modeling complex weather dynamics from small datasets, a bottleneck for many prediction tasks in agriculture, epidemiology, and climate science. WeatherFormer was pretrained on a large pretraining dataset comprised of 39 years of satellite measurements across the Americas. With a novel pretraining task and fine-tuning, WeatherFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance in county-level soybean yield prediction and influenza forecasting. Technical innovations include a unique spatiotemporal encoding that captures geographical, annual, and seasonal variations, adapting the transformer architecture to continuous weather data, and a pretraining strategy to learn representations that are robust to missing weather features. This paper for the first time demonstrates the effectiveness of pretraining large transformer encoder models for weather-dependent applications across multiple domains.</description>

      <title>Blood Glucose Control Via Pre-trained Counterfactual Invertible Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood glucose (BG) control issues. The state-of-the-art solution for continuous BG control is reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent can dynamically adjust exogenous insulin doses in time to maintain BG levels within the target range. However, due to the lack of action guidance, the agent often needs to learn from randomized trials to understand misleading correlations between exogenous insulin doses and BG levels, which can lead to instability and unsafety. To address these challenges, we propose an introspective RL based on Counterfactual Invertible Neural Networks (CINN). We use the pre-trained CINN as a frozen introspective block of the RL agent, which integrates forward prediction and counterfactual inference to guide the policy updates, promoting more stable and safer BG control. Constructed based on interpretable causal order, CINN employs bidirectional encoders with affine coupling layers to ensure invertibility while using orthogonal weight normalization to enhance the trainability, thereby ensuring the bidirectional differentiability of network parameters. We experimentally validate the accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained CINN in BG prediction and counterfactual inference for action. Furthermore, our experimental results highlight the effectiveness of pre-trained CINN in guiding RL policy updates for more accurate and safer BG control.</description>

      <title>Integrating Medical Imaging and Clinical Reports Using Multimodal Deep Learning for Advanced Disease Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an innovative multi-modal deep learning model is proposed to deeply integrate heterogeneous information from medical images and clinical reports. First, for medical images, convolutional neural networks were used to extract high-dimensional features and capture key visual information such as focal details, texture and spatial distribution. Secondly, for clinical report text, a two-way long and short-term memory network combined with an attention mechanism is used for deep semantic understanding, and key statements related to the disease are accurately captured. The two features interact and integrate effectively through the designed multi-modal fusion layer to realize the joint representation learning of image and text. In the empirical study, we selected a large medical image database covering a variety of diseases, combined with corresponding clinical reports for model training and validation. The proposed multimodal deep learning model demonstrated substantial superiority in the realms of disease classification, lesion localization, and clinical description generation, as evidenced by the experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming at the limitations of traditional medical decision system in processing large-scale heterogeneous medical data and realizing highly personalized recommendation, this paper introduces a personalized medical decision algorithm utilizing graph neural network (GNN). This research innovatively integrates graph neural network technology into the medical and health field, aiming to build a high-precision representation model of patient health status by mining the complex association between patients' clinical characteristics, genetic information, living habits. In this study, medical data is preprocessed to transform it into a graph structure, where nodes represent different data entities (such as patients, diseases, genes, etc.) and edges represent interactions or relationships between entities. The core of the algorithm is to design a novel multi-scale fusion mechanism, combining the historical medical records, physiological indicators and genetic characteristics of patients, to dynamically adjust the attention allocation strategy of the graph neural network, so as to achieve highly customized analysis of individual cases. In the experimental part, this study selected several publicly available medical data sets for validation, and the results showed that compared with traditional machine learning methods and a single graph neural network model, the proposed personalized medical decision algorithm showed significantly superior performance in terms of disease prediction accuracy, treatment effect evaluation and patient risk stratification.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation by Leveraging Global and Local Statistical Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data valuation has garnered increasing attention in recent years, given the critical role of high-quality data in various applications, particularly in machine learning tasks. There are diverse technical avenues to quantify the value of data within a corpus. While Shapley value-based methods are among the most widely used techniques in the literature due to their solid theoretical foundation, the accurate calculation of Shapley values is often intractable, leading to the proposal of numerous approximated calculation methods. Despite significant progress, nearly all existing methods overlook the utilization of distribution information of values within a data corpus. In this paper, we demonstrate that both global and local statistical information of value distributions hold significant potential for data valuation within the context of machine learning. Firstly, we explore the characteristics of both global and local value distributions across several simulated and real data corpora. Useful observations and clues are obtained. Secondly, we propose a new data valuation method that estimates Shapley values by incorporating the explored distribution characteristics into an existing method, AME. Thirdly, we present a new path to address the dynamic data valuation problem by formulating an optimization problem that integrates information of both global and local value distributions. Extensive experiments are conducted on Shapley value estimation, value-based data removal/adding, mislabeled data detection, and incremental/decremental data valuation. The results showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methodologies, affirming the significant potential of global and local value distributions in data valuation.</description>

      <title>Deep Activity Model: A Generative Approach for Human Mobility Pattern Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human mobility significantly impacts various aspects of society, including transportation, urban planning, and public health. The increasing availability of diverse mobility data and advancements in deep learning have revolutionized mobility modeling. Existing deep learning models, however, mainly study spatio-temporal patterns using trajectories and often fall short in capturing the underlying semantic interdependency among activities. Moreover, they are also constrained by the data source. These two factors thereby limit their realism and adaptability, respectively. Meanwhile, traditional activity-based models (ABMs) in transportation modeling rely on rigid assumptions and are costly and time-consuming to calibrate, making them difficult to adapt and scale to new regions, especially those regions with limited amount of required conventional travel data. To address these limitations, we develop a novel generative deep learning approach for human mobility modeling and synthesis, using ubiquitous and open-source data. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned with local data, enabling adaptable and accurate representations of mobility patterns across different regions. The model is evaluated on a nationwide dataset of the United States, where it demonstrates superior performance in generating activity chains that closely follow ground truth distributions. Further tests using state- or city-specific datasets from California, Washington, and Mexico City confirm its transferability. This innovative approach offers substantial potential to advance mobility modeling research, especially in generating human activity chains as input for downstream activity-based mobility simulation models and providing enhanced tools for urban planners and policymakers.</description>

Abstract: Freshwater scarcity is a global problem that requires collective efforts across all industry sectors. Nevertheless, a lack of access to operational water footprint data bars many applications from exploring optimization opportunities hidden within the temporal and spatial variations. To break this barrier into research in water sustainability, we build a dataset for operation direct water usage in the cooling systems and indirect water embedded in electricity generation. Our dataset consists of the hourly water efficiency of major U.S. cities and states from 2019 to 2023. We also offer cooling system models that capture the impact of weather on water efficiency. We present a preliminary analysis of our dataset and discuss three potential applications that can benefit from it. Our dataset is publicly available at Open Science Framework (OSF)</description>

      <title>Athena: Efficient Block-Wise Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models Using Second-Order Matrix Derivative Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. However, their large size, often consisting of billions of parameters, poses challenges for storage, computation, and deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and edge computing platforms. Effective compression and quantization techniques are crucial for addressing these issues, reducing memory footprint and computational requirements without significantly compromising performance. Traditional methods that uniformly map parameters to compressed spaces fail to account for the uneven distribution of parameters, leading to substantial accuracy loss. In this work, we propose Athena, a novel algorithm for efficient block-wise post-training quantization of LLMs. Athena leverages Second-Order Matrix Derivative Information to guide the quantization process using the curvature information of the loss landscape. By grouping parameters by columns or rows and iteratively optimizing the quantization process, Athena updates the model parameters and Hessian matrix to achieve significant compression while maintaining high accuracy. This makes Athena a practical solution for deploying LLMs in various settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has garnered increasing attention recently. However, due to the intrinsic spatio-temporal non-stationarity of data distributions, the current approaches typically suffer from high interaction and communication costs. In this paper, we introduce a new FRL algorithm, named \alg{}, that utilizes momentum, importance sampling, and additional server-side adjustment to control the shift of stochastic policy gradients and enhance the efficiency of data utilization. We prove that by proper selection of momentum parameters and interaction frequency, \alg{} can achieve $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H N^{-1}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ interaction and communication complexities ($N$ represents the number of agents), where the interaction complexity achieves linear speedup with the number of agents, and the communication complexity aligns the best achievable of existing first-order FL algorithms. Extensive experiments corroborate the substantial performance gains of \alg{} over existing methods on a suite of complex and high-dimensional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FreezeAsGuard: Mitigating Illegal Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Selective Tensor Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can be fine-tuned in custom domains to adapt to specific user preferences, but such unconstrained adaptability has also been utilized for illegal purposes, such as forging public figures' portraits and duplicating copyrighted artworks. Most existing work focuses on detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Other schemes of model unlearning and reinitialization, similarly, cannot prevent users from relearning the knowledge of illegal model adaptation with custom data. In this paper, we present FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. The basic approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate the fine-tuned model's representation power in illegal domains but minimize the impact on legal model adaptations in other domains. Such tensor freezing can be enforced via APIs provided by the model publisher for fine-tuning, can motivate users' adoption due to its computational savings. Experiment results with datasets in multiple domains show that FreezeAsGuard provides stronger power in mitigating illegal model adaptations of generating fake public figures' portraits, while having the minimum impact on model adaptation in other legal domains.

      <title>Repeat-Aware Neighbor Sampling for Dynamic Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic graph learning equips the edges with time attributes and allows multiple links between two nodes, which is a crucial technology for understanding evolving data scenarios like traffic prediction and recommendation systems. Existing works obtain the evolving patterns mainly depending on the most recent neighbor sequences. However, we argue that whether two nodes will have interaction with each other in the future is highly correlated with the same interaction that happened in the past. Only considering the recent neighbors overlooks the phenomenon of repeat behavior and fails to accurately capture the temporal evolution of interactions. To fill this gap, this paper presents RepeatMixer, which considers evolving patterns of first and high-order repeat behavior in the neighbor sampling strategy and temporal information learning. Firstly, we define the first-order repeat-aware nodes of the source node as the destination nodes that have interacted historically and extend this concept to high orders as nodes in the destination node's high-order neighbors. Then, we extract neighbors of the source node that interacted before the appearance of repeat-aware nodes with a slide window strategy as its neighbor sequence. Next, we leverage both the first and high-order neighbor sequences of source and destination nodes to learn temporal patterns of interactions via an MLP-based encoder. Furthermore, considering the varying temporal patterns on different orders, we introduce a time-aware aggregation mechanism that adaptively aggregates the temporal representations from different orders based on the significance of their interaction time sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RepeatMixer over state-of-the-art models in link prediction tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed repeat-aware neighbor sampling strategy.</description>

      <title>Federated Offline Policy Optimization with Dual Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has been deemed as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in the era of Artificial Internet of Things. However, existing FRL approaches often entail repeated interactions with the environment during local updating, which can be prohibitively expensive or even infeasible in many real-world domains. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a novel offline federated policy optimization algorithm, named $\texttt{DRPO}$, which enables distributed agents to collaboratively learn a decision policy only from private and static data without further environmental interactions. $\texttt{DRPO}$ leverages dual regularization, incorporating both the local behavioral policy and the global aggregated policy, to judiciously cope with the intrinsic two-tier distributional shifts in offline FRL. Theoretical analysis characterizes the impact of the dual regularization on performance, demonstrating that by achieving the right balance thereof, $\texttt{DRPO}$ can effectively counteract distributional shifts and ensure strict policy improvement in each federative learning round. Extensive experiments validate the significant performance gains of $\texttt{DRPO}$ over baseline methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An image is often said to be worth a thousand words, and certain images can tell rich and insightful stories. Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), dedicated to measuring the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k, labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context, as well as a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision that our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</description>

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) with imperfect demonstrations has garnered increasing attention owing to the scarcity of expert data in many real-world domains. A fundamental problem in this scenario is how to extract positive behaviors from noisy data. In general, current approaches to the problem select data building on state-action similarity to given expert demonstrations, neglecting precious information in (potentially abundant) $\textit{diverse}$ state-actions that deviate from expert ones. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective data selection method that identifies positive behaviors based on their resultant states -- a more informative criterion enabling explicit utilization of dynamics information and effective extraction of both expert and beneficial diverse behaviors. Further, we devise a lightweight behavior cloning algorithm capable of leveraging the expert and selected data correctly. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on a suite of complex and high-dimensional offline IL benchmarks, including continuous-control and vision-based tasks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods on $\textbf{20/21}$ benchmarks, typically by $\textbf{2-5x}$, while maintaining a comparable runtime to Behavior Cloning ($\texttt{BC}$).</description>

      <title>OLLIE: Imitation Learning from Offline Pretraining to Online Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study offline-to-online Imitation Learning (IL) that pretrains an imitation policy from static demonstration data, followed by fast finetuning with minimal environmental interaction. We find the na\"ive combination of existing offline IL and online IL methods tends to behave poorly in this context, because the initial discriminator (often used in online IL) operates randomly and discordantly against the policy initialization, leading to misguided policy optimization and $\textit{unlearning}$ of pretraining knowledge. To overcome this challenge, we propose a principled offline-to-online IL method, named $\texttt{OLLIE}$, that simultaneously learns a near-expert policy initialization along with an $\textit{aligned discriminator initialization}$, which can be seamlessly integrated into online IL, achieving smooth and fast finetuning. Empirically, $\texttt{OLLIE}$ consistently and significantly outperforms the baseline methods in $\textbf{20}$ challenging tasks, from continuous control to vision-based domains, in terms of performance, demonstration efficiency, and convergence speed. This work may serve as a foundation for further exploration of pretraining and finetuning in the context of IL.</description>

      <title>Concept-based Explainable Malignancy Scoring on Pulmonary Nodules in CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To increase the transparency of modern computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for assessing the malignancy of lung nodules, an interpretable model based on applying the generalized additive models and the concept-based learning is proposed. The model detects a set of clinically significant attributes in addition to the final malignancy regression score and learns the association between the lung nodule attributes and a final diagnosis decision as well as their contributions into the decision. The proposed concept-based learning framework provides human-readable explanations in terms of different concepts (numerical and categorical), their values, and their contribution to the final prediction. Numerical experiments with the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that the diagnosis results obtained using the proposed model, which explicitly explores internal relationships, are in line with similar patterns observed in clinical practice. Additionally, the proposed model shows the competitive classification and the nodule attribute scoring performance, highlighting its potential for effective decision-making in the lung nodule diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevalent use of Transformer-like models, exemplified by ChatGPT in modern language processing applications, underscores the critical need for enabling private inference essential for many cloud-based services reliant on such models. However, current privacy-preserving frameworks impose significant communication burden, especially for non-linear computation in Transformer model. In this paper, we introduce a novel plug-in method Comet to effectively reduce the communication cost without compromising the inference performance. We second introduce an efficient approximation method to eliminate the heavy communication in finding good initial approximation. We evaluate our Comet on Bert and RoBERTa models with GLUE benchmark datasets, showing up to 3.9$\times$ less communication and 3.5$\times$ speedups while keep competitive model performance compared to the prior art.</description>

      <title>On the Inflation of KNN-Shapley Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley value-based data valuation methods, originating from cooperative game theory, quantify the usefulness of each individual sample by considering its contribution to all possible training subsets. Despite their extensive applications, these methods encounter the challenge of value inflation - while samples with negative Shapley values are detrimental, some with positive values can also be harmful. This challenge prompts two fundamental questions: the suitability of zero as a threshold for distinguishing detrimental from beneficial samples and the determination of an appropriate threshold. To address these questions, we focus on KNN-Shapley and propose Calibrated KNN-Shapley (CKNN-Shapley), which calibrates zero as the threshold to distinguish detrimental samples from beneficial ones by mitigating the negative effects of small-sized training subsets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CKNN-Shapley in alleviating data valuation inflation, detecting detrimental samples, and assessing data quality. We also extend our approach beyond conventional classification settings, applying it to diverse and practical scenarios such as learning with mislabeled data, online learning with stream data, and active learning for label annotation.</description>

Abstract: Statistical methods have been widely misused and misinterpreted in various scientific fields, raising significant concerns about the integrity of scientific research. To develop techniques to mitigate this problem, we propose a new method for formally specifying and automatically verifying the correctness of statistical programs. In this method, programmers are reminded to check the requirements for statistical methods by annotating their source code. Then, a software tool called StatWhy automatically checks whether the programmers have properly specified the requirements for the statistical methods. This tool is implemented using the Why3 platform to verify the correctness of OCaml programs for statistical hypothesis testing. We demonstrate how StatWhy can be used to avoid common errors in a variety of popular hypothesis testing programs.</description>

      <title>Secure Hierarchical Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks Using Dynamic Client Selection and Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) faces the significant challenge of adversarial or unreliable vehicles in vehicular networks, which can compromise the model's integrity through misleading updates. Addressing this, our study introduces a novel framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection and robust anomaly detection mechanisms, aiming to optimize participant selection and mitigate risks associated with malicious contributions. Our approach involves a comprehensive vehicle reliability assessment, considering historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. An anomaly detection algorithm is utilized to identify anomalous behavior by analyzing the cosine similarity of local or model parameters during the federated learning (FL) process. These anomaly records are then registered and combined with past performance for accuracy and contribution frequency to identify the most suitable vehicles for each learning round. Dynamic client selection and anomaly detection algorithms are deployed at different levels, including cluster heads (CHs), cluster members (CMs), and the Evolving Packet Core (EPC), to detect and filter out spurious updates. Through simulation-based performance evaluation, our proposed algorithm demonstrates remarkable resilience even under intense attack conditions. Even in the worst-case scenarios, it achieves convergence times at $63$\% as effective as those in scenarios without any attacks. Conversely, in scenarios without utilizing our proposed algorithm, there is a high likelihood of non-convergence in the FL process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article uses machine learning (ML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to investigate the relationship between nutritional status and mortality rates associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) database is employed for analysis. The random forest model is selected as the base model for XAI analysis, and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method is used to assess feature importance. The results highlight significant nutritional factors such as serum vitamin B12 and glycated hemoglobin. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of random forests in predicting AD mortality compared to other diseases. This research provides insights into the impact of nutrition on AD and contributes to a deeper understanding of disease progression.</description>

      <title>Code Repair with LLMs gives an Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iteratively improving and repairing source code with large language models (LLMs), known as refinement, has emerged as a popular way of generating programs that would be too complex to construct in one shot. Given a bank of test cases, together with a candidate program, an LLM can improve that program by being prompted with failed test cases. But it remains an open question how to best iteratively refine code, with prior work employing simple greedy or breadth-first strategies. We show here that refinement exposes an explore-exploit tradeoff: exploit by refining the program that passes the most test cases, or explore by refining a lesser considered program. We frame this as an arm-acquiring bandit problem, which we solve with Thompson Sampling. The resulting LLM-based program synthesis algorithm is broadly applicable: Across loop invariant synthesis, visual reasoning puzzles, and competition programming problems, we find that our new method can solve more problems using fewer language model calls.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sustainable Urban Mobility Prediction with Telecom Data: A Spatio-Temporal Framework Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional traffic prediction, limited by the scope of sensor data, falls short in comprehensive traffic management. Mobile networks offer a promising alternative using network activity counts, but these lack crucial directionality. Thus, we present the TeltoMob dataset, featuring undirected telecom counts and corresponding directional flows, to predict directional mobility flows on roadways. To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's compatibility with various STGNN models and confirm its effectiveness. We also show how to incorporate the framework into real-world transportation systems, enhancing sustainable urban mobility.</description>

      <title>On Fairness of Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA and sometimes without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent -- in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LambdaBeam is a state-of-the-art execution-guided algorithm for program synthesis that incorporates higher-order functions, lambda functions, and iterative loops into the Domain-Specific Language (DSL). LambdaBeam generates every program from the start. Yet, many program blocks or subprograms occur frequently in a given domain, e.g., loops to traverse a list. Thus, repeating programs can be used to enhance the synthesis algorithm. However, LambdaBeam fails to leverage this potential. For this purpose, we introduce AbstractBeam: A novel program synthesis framework that employs Library Learning to identify such program repetitions, integrates them into the DSL, and thus utilizes their potential to boost LambdaBeam's synthesis algorithm. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that AbstractBeam significantly improves LambdaBeam's performance in the LambdaBeam integer list manipulation domain. Additionally, AbstractBeam's program generation is more efficient compared to LambdaBeam's synthesis. Finally, our findings indicate that Library Learning is effective in domains not specifically crafted to highlight its benefits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the quality of black-box Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has become ever more significant, especially in safety-critical domains such as automated driving. While global concept encodings generally enable a user to test a model for a specific concept, linking global concept encodings to the local processing of single network inputs reveals their strengths and limitations. Our proposed framework global-to-local Concept Attribution (glCA) uses approaches from local (why a specific prediction originates) and global (how a model works generally) eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) to test DNNs for a predefined semantical concept locally. The approach allows for conditioning local, post-hoc explanations on predefined semantic concepts encoded as linear directions in the model's latent space. Pixel-exact scoring concerning the global concept usage assists the tester in further understanding the model processing of single data points for the selected concept. Our approach has the advantage of fully covering the model-internal encoding of the semantic concept and allowing the localization of relevant concept-related information. The results show major differences in the local perception and usage of individual global concept encodings and demand for further investigations regarding obtaining thorough semantic concept encodings.</description>

      <title>Unisolver: PDE-Conditional Transformers Are Universal PDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models have recently emerged as a promising tool to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural solvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve the PDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a specific set of PDEs, e.g. a certain equation or a finite set of coefficients. This bottleneck limits the generalizability of neural solvers, which is widely recognized as its major advantage over numerical solvers. In this paper, we present the Universal PDE solver (Unisolver) capable of solving a wide scope of PDEs by leveraging a Transformer pre-trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs. Instead of simply scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from the theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Our key finding is that a PDE solution is fundamentally under the control of a series of PDE components, e.g. equation symbols, coefficients, and initial and boundary conditions. Inspired by the mathematical structure of PDEs, we define a complete set of PDE components and correspondingly embed them as domain-wise (e.g. equation symbols) and point-wise (e.g. boundaries) conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating physical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves consistent state-of-the-art results on three challenging large-scale benchmarks, showing impressive gains and endowing favorable generalizability and scalability.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Dataset Condensation for Faster Hyperparameter Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset condensation can be used to reduce the computational cost of training multiple models on a large dataset by condensing the training dataset into a small synthetic set. State-of-the-art approaches rely on matching the model gradients between the real and synthetic data. However, there is no theoretical guarantee of the generalizability of the condensed data: data condensation often generalizes poorly across hyperparameters/architectures in practice. This paper considers a different condensation objective specifically geared toward hyperparameter search. We aim to generate a synthetic validation dataset so that the validation-performance rankings of the models, with different hyperparameters, on the condensed and original datasets are comparable. We propose a novel hyperparameter-calibrated dataset condensation (HCDC) algorithm, which obtains the synthetic validation dataset by matching the hyperparameter gradients computed via implicit differentiation and efficient inverse Hessian approximation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively maintains the validation-performance rankings of models and speeds up hyperparameter/architecture search for tasks on both images and graphs.</description>

Abstract: Probabilistic verification of neural networks is concerned with formally analysing the output distribution of a neural network under a probability distribution of the inputs. Examples of probabilistic verification include verifying the demographic parity fairness notion or quantifying the safety of a neural network. We present a new algorithm for the probabilistic verification of neural networks based on an algorithm for computing and iteratively refining lower and upper bounds on probabilities over the outputs of a neural network. By applying state-of-the-art bound propagation and branch and bound techniques from non-probabilistic neural network verification, our algorithm significantly outpaces existing probabilistic verification algorithms, reducing solving times for various benchmarks from the literature from tens of minutes to tens of seconds. Furthermore, our algorithm compares favourably even to dedicated algorithms for restricted subsets of probabilistic verification. We complement our empirical evaluation with a theoretical analysis, proving that our algorithm is sound and, under mildly restrictive conditions, also complete when using a suitable set of heuristics.</description>

      <title>Discriminant audio properties in deep learning based respiratory insufficiency detection in Brazilian Portuguese</title>

Abstract: This work investigates Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that detect respiratory insufficiency (RI) by analyzing speech audios, thus treating speech as a RI biomarker. Previous works collected RI data (P1) from COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic and trained modern AI models, such as CNNs and Transformers, which achieved $96.5\%$ accuracy, showing the feasibility of RI detection via AI. Here, we collect RI patient data (P2) with several causes besides COVID-19, aiming at extending AI-based RI detection. We also collected control data from hospital patients without RI. We show that the considered models, when trained on P1, do not generalize to P2, indicating that COVID-19 RI has features that may not be found in all RI types.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Mechanics of Feature Learning: Bottleneck Structure in Leaky ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Leaky ResNets, which interpolate between ResNets ($\tilde{L}=0$) and Fully-Connected nets ($\tilde{L}\to\infty$) depending on an 'effective depth' hyper-parameter $\tilde{L}$. In the infinite depth limit, we study 'representation geodesics' $A_{p}$: continuous paths in representation space (similar to NeuralODEs) from input $p=0$ to output $p=1$ that minimize the parameter norm of the network. We give a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulation, which highlight the importance of two terms: a kinetic energy which favors small layer derivatives $\partial_{p}A_{p}$ and a potential energy that favors low-dimensional representations, as measured by the 'Cost of Identity'. The balance between these two forces offers an intuitive understanding of feature learning in ResNets. We leverage this intuition to explain the emergence of a bottleneck structure, as observed in previous work: for large $\tilde{L}$ the potential energy dominates and leads to a separation of timescales, where the representation jumps rapidly from the high dimensional inputs to a low-dimensional representation, move slowly inside the space of low-dimensional representations, before jumping back to the potentially high-dimensional outputs. Inspired by this phenomenon, we train with an adaptive layer step-size to adapt to the separation of timescales.</description>

      <title>Container pre-marshalling problem minimizing CV@R under uncertainty of ship arrival times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the container pre-marshalling problem, which involves relocating containers in the storage area so that they can be efficiently loaded onto ships without reshuffles. In reality, however, ship arrival times are affected by various external factors, which can cause the order of container retrieval to be different from the initial plan. To represent such uncertainty, we generate multiple scenarios from a multivariate probability distribution of ship arrival times. We derive a mixed-integer linear optimization model to find an optimal container layout such that the conditional value-at-risk is minimized for the number of misplaced containers responsible for reshuffles. Moreover, we devise an exact algorithm based on the cutting-plane method to handle large-scale problems. Numerical experiments using synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality container layouts compared with the conventional robust optimization model. Additionally, our algorithm can speed up the computation of solving large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training dynamics of linear networks are well studied in two distinct setups: the lazy regime and balanced/active regime, depending on the initialization and width of the network. We provide a surprisingly simple unyfing formula for the evolution of the learned matrix that contains as special cases both lazy and balanced regimes but also a mixed regime in between the two. In the mixed regime, a part of the network is lazy while the other is balanced. More precisely the network is lazy along singular values that are below a certain threshold and balanced along those that are above the same threshold. At initialization, all singular values are lazy, allowing for the network to align itself with the task, so that later in time, when some of the singular value cross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly (convergence in the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence of alignment). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it converges from any random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics which require special initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent in the lazy dynamics). This allows us to prove an almost complete phase diagram of training behavior as a function of the variance at initialization and the width, for a MSE training task.</description>

      <title>LoRA-XS: Low-Rank Adaptation with Extremely Small Number of Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent trend in scaling language models has led to a growing demand for parameter-efficient tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the full fine-tuning baseline with fewer parameters. However, handling numerous task-specific or user-specific LoRA modules on top of a base model still presents significant storage challenges. To address this, we introduce LoRA-XS (Low-Rank Adaptation with eXtremely Small number of parameters), a novel approach leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. LoRA-XS introduces a small r x r weight matrix between frozen LoRA matrices, which are constructed by SVD of the original weight matrix. Training only r x r weight matrices ensures independence from model dimensions, enabling more parameter-efficient fine-tuning, especially for larger models. LoRA-XS achieves a remarkable reduction of trainable parameters by over 100x in 7B models compared to LoRA. Our benchmarking across various scales, including GLUE, GSM8k, and MATH benchmarks, shows that our approach outperforms LoRA and recent state-of-the-art approaches like VeRA in terms of parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Advancing Cultural Inclusivity: Optimizing Embedding Spaces for Balanced Music Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popularity bias in music recommendation systems -- where artists and tracks with the highest listen counts are recommended more often -- can also propagate biases along demographic and cultural axes. In this work, we identify these biases in recommendations for artists from underrepresented cultural groups in prototype-based matrix factorization methods. Unlike traditional matrix factorization methods, prototype-based approaches are interpretable. This allows us to directly link the observed bias in recommendations for minority artists (the effect) to specific properties of the embedding space (the cause). We mitigate popularity bias in music recommendation through capturing both users' and songs' cultural nuances in the embedding space. To address these challenges while maintaining recommendation quality, we propose two novel enhancements to the embedding space: i) we propose an approach to filter-out the irrelevant prototypes used to represent each user and item to improve generalizability, and ii) we introduce regularization techniques to reinforce a more uniform distribution of prototypes within the embedding space. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in reducing popularity bias and enhancing demographic and cultural fairness in music recommendations while achieving competitive -- if not better -- overall performance.</description>

      <title>Explainable machine learning multi-label classification of Spanish legal judgements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) have not been exploited to their maximum potential in the legal domain. This has been partially due to the insufficient explanations they provided about their decisions. Automatic expert systems with explanatory capabilities can be specially useful when legal practitioners search jurisprudence to gather contextual knowledge for their cases. Therefore, we propose a hybrid system that applies ML for multi-label classification of judgements (sentences) and visual and natural language descriptions for explanation purposes, boosted by Natural Language Processing techniques and deep legal reasoning to identify the entities, such as the parties, involved. We are not aware of any prior work on automatic multi-label classification of legal judgements also providing natural language explanations to the end-users with comparable overall quality. Our solution achieves over 85 % micro precision on a labelled data set annotated by legal experts. This endorses its interest to relieve human experts from monotonous labour-intensive legal classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Reinforcement Learning Loss for Robust Learning on Diverse Tasks and Model Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) training is inherently unstable due to factors such as moving targets and high gradient variance. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) can introduce additional difficulty. Differing preferences can complicate the alignment process, and prediction errors in a trained reward model can become more severe as the LLM generates unseen outputs. To enhance training robustness, RL has adopted techniques from supervised learning, such as ensembles and layer normalization. In this work, we improve the stability of RL training by adapting the reverse cross entropy (RCE) from supervised learning for noisy data to define a symmetric RL loss. We demonstrate performance improvements across various tasks and scales. We conduct experiments in discrete action tasks (Atari games) and continuous action space tasks (MuJoCo benchmark and Box2D) using Symmetric A2C (SA2C) and Symmetric PPO (SPPO), with and without added noise with especially notable performance in SPPO across different hyperparameters. Furthermore, we validate the benefits of the symmetric RL loss when using SPPO for large language models through improved performance in RLHF tasks, such as IMDB positive sentiment sentiment and TL;DR summarization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most methods in reinforcement learning use a Policy Gradient (PG) approach to learn a parametric stochastic policy that maps states to actions. The standard approach is to implement such a mapping via a neural network (NN) whose parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent. However, PG methods are prone to large policy updates that can render learning inefficient. Trust region algorithms, like Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), constrain the policy update step, ensuring monotonic improvements. This paper introduces low-rank matrix-based models as an efficient alternative for estimating the parameters of TRPO algorithms. By gathering the stochastic policy's parameters into a matrix and applying matrix-completion techniques, we promote and enforce low rank. Our numerical studies demonstrate that low-rank matrix-based policy models effectively reduce both computational and sample complexities compared to NN models, while maintaining comparable aggregated rewards.</description>

Abstract: Estimating a policy that maps states to actions is a central problem in reinforcement learning. Traditionally, policies are inferred from the so called value functions (VFs), but exact VF computation suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Policy gradient (PG) methods bypass this by learning directly a parametric stochastic policy. Typically, the parameters of the policy are estimated using neural networks (NNs) tuned via stochastic gradient descent. However, finding adequate NN architectures can be challenging, and convergence issues are common as well. In this paper, we put forth low-rank matrix-based models to estimate efficiently the parameters of PG algorithms. We collect the parameters of the stochastic policy into a matrix, and then, we leverage matrix-completion techniques to promote (enforce) low rank. We demonstrate via numerical studies how low-rank matrix-based policy models reduce the computational and sample complexities relative to NN models, while achieving a similar aggregated reward.</description>

      <title>Tensor Low-rank Approximation of Finite-horizon Value Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of reinforcement learning is estimating a policy that maps states to actions and maximizes the cumulative reward of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This is oftentimes achieved by estimating first the optimal (reward) value function (VF) associated with each state-action pair. When the MDP has an infinite horizon, the optimal VFs and policies are stationary under mild conditions. However, in finite-horizon MDPs, the VFs (hence, the policies) vary with time. This poses a challenge since the number of VFs to estimate grows not only with the size of the state-action space but also with the time horizon. This paper proposes a non-parametric low-rank stochastic algorithm to approximate the VFs of finite-horizon MDPs. First, we represent the (unknown) VFs as a multi-dimensional array, or tensor, where time is one of the dimensions. Then, we use rewards sampled from the MDP to estimate the optimal VFs. More precisely, we use the (truncated) PARAFAC decomposition to design an online low-rank algorithm that recovers the entries of the tensor of VFs. The size of the low-rank PARAFAC model grows additively with respect to each of its dimensions, rendering our approach efficient, as demonstrated via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The surprising efficiency of temporal difference learning for rare event prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the efficiency of temporal difference (TD) learning over the direct, or Monte Carlo (MC), estimator for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on estimation of quantities related to rare events. Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</description>

      <title>Probabilistically Plausible Counterfactual Explanations with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PPCEF, a novel method for generating probabilistically plausible counterfactual explanations (CFs). PPCEF advances beyond existing methods by combining a probabilistic formulation that leverages the data distribution with the optimization of plausibility within a unified framework. Compared to reference approaches, our method enforces plausibility by directly optimizing the explicit density function without assuming a particular family of parametrized distributions. This ensures CFs are not only valid (i.e., achieve class change) but also align with the underlying data's probability density. For that purpose, our approach leverages normalizing flows as powerful density estimators to capture the complex high-dimensional data distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss that balances the trade-off between achieving class change and maintaining closeness to the original instance while also incorporating a probabilistic plausibility term. PPCEF's unconstrained formulation allows for efficient gradient-based optimization with batch processing, leading to orders of magnitude faster computation compared to prior methods. Moreover, the unconstrained formulation of PPCEF allows for the seamless integration of future constraints tailored to specific counterfactual properties. Finally, extensive evaluations demonstrate PPCEF's superiority in generating high-quality, probabilistically plausible counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional tabular settings. This makes PPCEF a powerful tool for not only interpreting complex machine learning models but also for improving fairness, accountability, and trust in AI systems.</description>

      <title>Unifying Perspectives: Plausible Counterfactual Explanations on Global, Group-wise, and Local Levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing regulatory and societal pressures demand increased transparency in AI, particularly in understanding the decisions made by complex machine learning models. Counterfactual Explanations (CFs) have emerged as a promising technique within Explainable AI (xAI), offering insights into individual model predictions. However, to understand the systemic biases and disparate impacts of AI models, it is crucial to move beyond local CFs and embrace global explanations, which offer a~holistic view across diverse scenarios and populations. Unfortunately, generating Global Counterfactual Explanations (GCEs) faces challenges in computational complexity, defining the scope of "global," and ensuring the explanations are both globally representative and locally plausible. We introduce a novel unified approach for generating Local, Group-wise, and Global Counterfactual Explanations for differentiable classification models via gradient-based optimization to address these challenges. This framework aims to bridge the gap between individual and systemic insights, enabling a deeper understanding of model decisions and their potential impact on diverse populations. Our approach further innovates by incorporating a probabilistic plausibility criterion, enhancing actionability and trustworthiness. By offering a cohesive solution to the optimization and plausibility challenges in GCEs, our work significantly advances the interpretability and accountability of AI models, marking a step forward in the pursuit of transparent AI.</description>

Abstract: In the real world, data is often noisy, affecting not only the quality of features but also the accuracy of labels. Current research on mitigating label errors stems primarily from advances in deep learning, and a gap exists in exploring interpretable models, particularly those rooted in decision trees. In this study, we investigate whether ideas from deep learning loss design can be applied to improve the robustness of decision trees. In particular, we show that loss correction and symmetric losses, both standard approaches, are not effective. We argue that other directions need to be explored to improve the robustness of decision trees to label noise.</description>

Abstract: The intersection between quantum computing and optimisation has been an area of interest in recent years. There have been numerous studies exploring the application of quantum and quantum-hybrid solvers to various optimisation problems. This work explores scalarisation methods within the context of solving the bi-objective quadratic assignment problem using a quantum-hybrid solver. We show results that are consistent with previous research on a different Ising machine.</description>

      <title>TIMA: Text-Image Mutual Awareness for Balancing Zero-Shot Adversarial Robustness and Generalization Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of achieving zero-shot adversarial robustness while preserving zero-shot generalization in large-scale foundation models, with a focus on the popular Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Although foundation models were reported to have exceptional zero-shot generalization, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods achieve a comparable good tradeoff between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization under small adversarial perturbations. However, they fail to achieve a good tradeoff under large adversarial perturbations. To this end, we propose a novel Text-Image Mutual Awareness (TIMA) method that strikes a balance between zero-shot adversarial robustness and generalization. More precisely, we propose an Image-Aware Text (IAT) tuning mechanism that increases the inter-class distance of text embeddings by incorporating the Minimum Hyperspherical Energy (MHE). Simultaneously, fixed pre-trained image embeddings are used as cross-modal auxiliary supervision to maintain the similarity between the MHE-tuned and original text embeddings by the knowledge distillation, preserving semantic information between different classes. Besides, we introduce a Text-Aware Image (TAI) tuning mechanism, which increases inter-class distance between image embeddings during the training stage by Text-distance based Adaptive Margin (TAM). Similarly, a knowledge distillation is utilized to retain the similarity between fine-tuned and pre-trained image embeddings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing impressive zero-shot performance against a wide range of adversarial perturbations while preserving the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the original CLIP model.</description>

      <title>OPERA: Automatic Offline Policy Evaluation with Re-weighted Aggregates of Multiple Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new sequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical interaction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online without a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or hazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE estimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have hyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE algorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset without relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We prove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable properties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when compared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select higher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to improving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy evaluation framework for offline RL.</description>

      <title>MindFormer: A Transformer Architecture for Multi-Subject Brain Decoding via fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research efforts to understand neural signals have been ongoing for many years, with visual decoding from fMRI signals attracting considerable attention. Particularly, the advent of image diffusion models has advanced the reconstruction of images from fMRI data significantly. However, existing approaches often introduce inter- and intra- subject variations in the reconstructed images, which can compromise accuracy. To address current limitations in multi-subject brain decoding, we introduce a new Transformer architecture called MindFormer. This model is specifically designed to generate fMRI-conditioned feature vectors that can be used for conditioning Stable Diffusion model. More specifically, MindFormer incorporates two key innovations: 1) a novel training strategy based on the IP-Adapter to extract semantically meaningful features from fMRI signals, and 2) a subject specific token and linear layer that effectively capture individual differences in fMRI signals while synergistically combines multi subject fMRI data for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stable Diffusion, when integrated with MindFormer, produces semantically consistent images across different subjects. This capability significantly surpasses existing models in multi-subject brain decoding. Such advancements not only improve the accuracy of our reconstructions but also deepen our understanding of neural processing variations among individuals.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Holistic Evaluations with LLMs: Insights from Scenario-Based Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workshop courses designed to foster creativity are gaining popularity. However, achieving a holistic evaluation that accommodates diverse perspectives is challenging, even for experienced faculty teams. Adequate discussion is essential to integrate varied assessments, but faculty often lack the time for such deliberations. Deriving an average score without discussion undermines the purpose of a holistic evaluation. This paper explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) as a facilitator to integrate diverse faculty assessments. Scenario-based experiments were conducted to determine if the LLM could synthesize diverse evaluations and explain the underlying theories to faculty. The results were noteworthy, showing that the LLM effectively facilitated faculty discussions. Additionally, the LLM demonstrated the capability to generalize and create evaluation criteria from a single scenario based on its learned domain knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning methods with targeted unimodal learning objectives have exhibited their superior efficacy in alleviating the imbalanced multimodal learning problem. However, in this paper, we identify the previously ignored gradient conflict between multimodal and unimodal learning objectives, potentially misleading the unimodal encoder optimization. To well diminish these conflicts, we observe the discrepancy between multimodal loss and unimodal loss, where both gradient magnitude and covariance of the easier-to-learn multimodal loss are smaller than the unimodal one. With this property, we analyze Pareto integration under our multimodal scenario and propose MMPareto algorithm, which could ensure a final gradient with direction that is common to all learning objectives and enhanced magnitude to improve generalization, providing innocent unimodal assistance. Finally, experiments across multiple types of modalities and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction indicate our superior and extendable method performance. Our method is also expected to facilitate multi-task cases with a clear discrepancy in task difficulty, demonstrating its ideal scalability. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/MMPareto_ICML2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for complex Operations Research (OR) in automating optimization modeling. However, current methodologies heavily rely on prompt engineering (e.g., multi-agent cooperation) with proprietary LLMs, raising data privacy concerns that could be prohibitive in industry applications. To tackle this issue, we propose training open-source LLMs for optimization modeling. We identify four critical requirements for the training dataset of OR LLMs, design and implement OR-Instruct, a semi-automated process for creating synthetic data tailored to specific requirements. We also introduce the IndustryOR benchmark, the first industrial benchmark for testing LLMs on solving real-world OR problems. We apply the data from OR-Instruct to various open-source LLMs of 7b size (termed as ORLMs), resulting in a significantly improved capability for optimization modeling. Our best-performing ORLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks. Our code and data will be available at \url{https://github.com/Cardinal-Operations/ORLM}.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Pruning for Backdoor Mitigation: An Optimization Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. Most of the existing defense methods rely on defined rules and focus on neuron's local properties, ignoring the exploration and optimization of pruning policies. To address this gap, we propose an Optimized Neuron Pruning (ONP) method combined with Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to repair backdoor models. Specifically, ONP first models the target DNN as graphs based on neuron connectivity, and then uses GNN-based RL agents to learn graph embeddings and find a suitable pruning policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to employ GNN and RL for optimizing pruning policies in the field of backdoor defense. Experiments show, with a small amount of clean data, ONP can effectively prune the backdoor neurons implanted by a set of backdoor attacks at the cost of negligible performance degradation, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance for backdoor mitigation.</description>

      <title>Magnitude-based Neuron Pruning for Backdoor Defens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, posing concerning threats to their reliable deployment. Recent research reveals that backdoors can be erased from infected DNNs by pruning a specific group of neurons, while how to effectively identify and remove these backdoor-associated neurons remains an open challenge. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between backdoor behavior and neuron magnitude, and find that backdoor neurons deviate from the magnitude-saliency correlation of the model. The deviation inspires us to propose a Magnitude-based Neuron Pruning (MNP) method to detect and prune backdoor neurons. Specifically, MNP uses three magnitude-guided objective functions to manipulate the magnitude-saliency correlation of backdoor neurons, thus achieving the purpose of exposing backdoor behavior, eliminating backdoor neurons and preserving clean neurons, respectively. Experiments show our pruning strategy achieves state-of-the-art backdoor defense performance against a variety of backdoor attacks with a limited amount of clean data, demonstrating the crucial role of magnitude for guiding backdoor defenses.</description>

      <title>XL3M: A Training-free Framework for LLM Length Extension Based on Segment-wise Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Length generalization failure problem, namely the large language model (LLM) fails to generalize to texts longer than its maximum training length, greatly restricts the application of LLM in the scenarios with streaming long inputs. To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.</description>

Abstract: Modeling and analyzing long sequences of text is an essential task for Natural Language Processing. Success in capturing long text dynamics using neural language models will facilitate many downstream tasks such as coherence evaluation, text generation, machine translation and so on. This paper presents a novel approach to model sequences through a stochastic process. We introduce a likelihood-based training objective for the text encoder and design a more thorough measurement (score) for long text evaluation compared to the previous approach. The proposed training objective effectively preserves the sequence coherence, while the new score comprehensively captures both temporal and spatial dependencies. Theoretical properties of our new score show its advantages in sequence evaluation. Experimental results show superior performance in various sequence evaluation tasks, including global and local discrimination within and between documents of different lengths. We also demonstrate the encoder achieves competitive results on discriminating human and AI written text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep is a complex physiological process evaluated through various modalities recording electrical brain, cardiac, and respiratory activities. We curate a large polysomnography dataset from over 14,000 participants comprising over 100,000 hours of multi-modal sleep recordings. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed SleepFM, the first multi-modal foundation model for sleep analysis. We show that a novel leave-one-out approach for contrastive learning significantly improves downstream task performance compared to representations from standard pairwise contrastive learning. A logistic regression model trained on SleepFM's learned embeddings outperforms an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on sleep stage classification (macro AUROC 0.88 vs 0.72 and macro AUPRC 0.72 vs 0.48) and sleep disordered breathing detection (AUROC 0.85 vs 0.69 and AUPRC 0.77 vs 0.61). Notably, the learned embeddings achieve 48% top-1 average accuracy in retrieving the corresponding recording clips of other modalities from 90,000 candidates. This work demonstrates the value of holistic multi-modal sleep modeling to fully capture the richness of sleep recordings. SleepFM is open source and available at https://github.com/rthapa84/sleepfm-codebase.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Horizon Actor-Critic for Policy Learning in Contact-Rich Differentiable Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning~(MFRL), leveraging the policy gradient theorem, has demonstrated considerable success in continuous control tasks. However, these approaches are plagued by high gradient variance due to zeroth-order gradient estimation, resulting in suboptimal policies. Conversely, First-Order Model-Based Reinforcement Learning~(FO-MBRL) methods, employing differentiable simulation, provide gradients with reduced variance but are susceptible to sampling error in scenarios involving stiff dynamics, such as physical contact. This paper investigates the source of this error and introduces Adaptive Horizon Actor-Critic (AHAC), an FO-MBRL algorithm that reduces gradient error by adapting the model-based horizon to avoid stiff dynamics. Empirical findings reveal that AHAC outperforms MFRL baselines, attaining 40\% more reward across a set of locomotion tasks, and efficiently scaling to high-dimensional control environments with improved wall-clock-time efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein interactions are central mediators in many biological processes. Accurately predicting the effects of mutations on interactions is crucial for guiding the modulation of these interactions, thereby playing a significant role in therapeutic development and drug discovery. Mutations generally affect interactions hierarchically across three levels: mutated residues exhibit different sidechain conformations, which lead to changes in the backbone conformation, eventually affecting the binding affinity between proteins. However, existing methods typically focus only on sidechain-level interaction modeling, resulting in suboptimal predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised multi-level pre-training framework, ProMIM, to fully capture all three levels of interactions with well-designed pretraining objectives. Experiments show ProMIM outperforms all the baselines on the standard benchmark, especially on mutations where significant changes in backbone conformations may occur. In addition, leading results from zero-shot evaluations for SARS-CoV-2 mutational effect prediction and antibody optimization underscore the potential of ProMIM as a powerful next-generation tool for developing novel therapeutic approaches and new drugs.</description>

      <title>TransVIP: Speech to Speech Translation System with Voice and Isochrony Preservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a rising interest and trend in research towards directly translating speech from one language to another, known as end-to-end speech-to-speech translation. However, most end-to-end models struggle to outperform cascade models, i.e., a pipeline framework by concatenating speech recognition, machine translation and text-to-speech models. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexities involved in direct translation tasks and the scarcity of data. In this study, we introduce a novel model framework TransVIP that leverages diverse datasets in a cascade fashion yet facilitates end-to-end inference through joint probability. Furthermore, we propose two separated encoders to preserve the speaker's voice characteristics and isochrony from the source speech during the translation process, making it highly suitable for scenarios such as video dubbing. Our experiments on the French-English language pair demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art speech-to-speech translation model.</description>

      <title>FAIntbench: A Holistic and Precise Benchmark for Bias Evaluation in Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development and reduced barriers to entry for Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised concerns about the biases in their outputs, but existing research lacks a holistic definition and evaluation framework of biases, limiting the enhancement of debiasing techniques. To address this issue, we introduce FAIntbench, a holistic and precise benchmark for biases in T2I models. In contrast to existing benchmarks that evaluate bias in limited aspects, FAIntbench evaluate biases from four dimensions: manifestation of bias, visibility of bias, acquired attributes, and protected attributes. We applied FAIntbench to evaluate seven recent large-scale T2I models and conducted human evaluation, whose results demonstrated the effectiveness of FAIntbench in identifying various biases. Our study also revealed new research questions about biases, including the side-effect of distillation. The findings presented here are preliminary, highlighting the potential of FAIntbench to advance future research aimed at mitigating the biases in T2I models. Our benchmark is publicly available to ensure the reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Don't Miss the Forest for the Trees: Attentional Vision Calibration for Large Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the issue observed in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), where excessive attention on a few image tokens, referred to as blind tokens, leads to hallucinatory responses in tasks requiring fine-grained understanding of visual objects. We found that tokens receiving lower attention weights often hold essential information for identifying nuanced object details -- ranging from merely recognizing object existence to identifying their attributes (color, position, etc.) and understanding their relationships. To counteract the over-emphasis on blind tokens and to accurately respond to user queries, we introduce a technique called Attentional Vision Calibration (AVC). During the decoding phase, AVC identifies blind tokens by analyzing the image-related attention distribution. It then dynamically adjusts the logits for the next token prediction by contrasting the logits conditioned on the original visual tokens with those conditioned on the blind tokens. This effectively lowers the dependency on blind tokens and promotes a more balanced consideration of all tokens. We validate AVC on benchmarks such as POPE, MME, and AMBER, where it consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques in mitigating object hallucinations in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>RITUAL: Random Image Transformations as a Universal Anti-hallucination Lever in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have revolutionized how machines understand and generate textual responses based on visual inputs. Despite their impressive capabilities, they often produce "hallucinatory" outputs that do not accurately reflect the visual information, posing challenges in reliability and trustworthiness. Current methods such as contrastive decoding have made strides in addressing these issues by contrasting the original probability distribution of generated tokens with distorted counterparts; yet, generating visually-faithful outputs remains a challenge. In this work, we shift our focus to the opposite: What could serve as a complementary enhancement to the original probability distribution? We propose a simple, training-free method termed RITUAL to enhance robustness against hallucinations in LVLMs. Our approach employs random image transformations as complements to the original probability distribution, aiming to mitigate the likelihood of hallucinatory visual explanations by enriching the model's exposure to varied visual scenarios. Our empirical results show that while the isolated use of transformed images initially degrades performance, strategic implementation of these transformations can indeed serve as effective complements. Notably, our method is compatible with current contrastive decoding methods and does not require external models or costly self-feedback mechanisms, making it a practical addition. In experiments, RITUAL significantly outperforms existing contrastive decoding methods across several object hallucination benchmarks, including POPE, CHAIR, and MME.</description>

      <title>Conv-CoA: Improving Open-domain Question Answering in Large Language Models via Conversational Chain-of-Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Conversational Chain-of-Action (Conv-CoA) framework for Open-domain Conversational Question Answering (OCQA). Compared with literature, Conv-CoA addresses three major challenges: (i) unfaithful hallucination that is inconsistent with real-time or domain facts, (ii) weak reasoning performance in conversational scenarios, and (iii) unsatisfying performance in conversational information retrieval. Our key contribution is a dynamic reasoning-retrieval mechanism that extracts the intent of the question and decomposes it into a reasoning chain to be solved via systematic prompting, pre-designed actions, updating the Contextual Knowledge Set (CKS), and a novel Hopfield-based retriever. Methodologically, we propose a resource-efficiency Hopfield retriever to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of conversational information retrieval within our actions. Additionally, we propose a conversational-multi-reference faith score (Conv-MRFS) to verify and resolve conflicts between retrieved knowledge and answers in conversations. Empirically, we conduct comparisons between our framework and 23 state-of-the-art methods across five different research directions and two public benchmarks. These comparisons demonstrate that our Conv-CoA outperforms other methods in both the accuracy and efficiency dimensions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Patching via Mixture-of-Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Diffusion Model Patching (DMP), a simple method to boost the performance of pre-trained diffusion models that have already reached convergence, with a negligible increase in parameters. DMP inserts a small, learnable set of prompts into the model's input space while keeping the original model frozen. The effectiveness of DMP is not merely due to the addition of parameters but stems from its dynamic gating mechanism, which selects and combines a subset of learnable prompts at every step of the generative process (e.g., reverse denoising steps). This strategy, which we term "mixture-of-prompts", enables the model to draw on the distinct expertise of each prompt, essentially "patching" the model's functionality at every step with minimal yet specialized parameters. Uniquely, DMP enhances the model by further training on the same dataset on which it was originally trained, even in a scenario where significant improvements are typically not expected due to model convergence. Experiments show that DMP significantly enhances the converged FID of DiT-L/2 on FFHQ 256x256 by 10.38%, achieved with only a 1.43% parameter increase and 50K additional training iterations.</description>

      <title>LDMol: Text-Conditioned Molecule Diffusion Model Leveraging Chemically Informative Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of diffusion models as the frontline of generative models, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques using conditional diffusion models. However, due to the fundamental nature of a molecule, which carries highly entangled correlations within a small number of atoms and bonds, it becomes difficult for a model to connect raw data with the conditions when the conditions become more complex as natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol, which enables a natural text-conditioned molecule generation. Specifically, LDMol is composed of three building blocks: a molecule encoder that produces a chemically informative feature space, a natural language-conditioned latent diffusion model using a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and an autoregressive decoder for molecule re. In particular, recognizing that multiple SMILES notations can represent the same molecule, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract the chemical informative feature space. LDMol not only beats the existing baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark but is also capable of zero-shot inference with unseen scenarios. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-driven molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Mollification Effects of Policy Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods have enabled deep reinforcement learning (RL) to approach challenging continuous control problems, even when the underlying systems involve highly nonlinear dynamics that generate complex non-smooth optimization landscapes. We develop a rigorous framework for understanding how policy gradient methods mollify non-smooth optimization landscapes to enable effective policy search, as well as the downside of it: while making the objective function smoother and easier to optimize, the stochastic objective deviates further from the original problem. We demonstrate the equivalence between policy gradient methods and solving backward heat equations. Following the ill-posedness of backward heat equations from PDE theory, we present a fundamental challenge to the use of policy gradient under stochasticity. Moreover, we make the connection between this limitation and the uncertainty principle in harmonic analysis to understand the effects of exploration with stochastic policies in RL. We also provide experimental results to illustrate both the positive and negative aspects of mollification effects in practice.</description>

      <title>Trust and Terror: Hazards in Text Reveal Negatively Biased Credulity and Partisan Negativity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Socio-linguistic indicators of text, such as emotion or sentiment, are often extracted using neural networks in order to better understand features of social media. One indicator that is often overlooked, however, is the presence of hazards within text. Recent psychological research suggests that statements about hazards are more believable than statements about benefits (a property known as negatively biased credulity), and that political liberals and conservatives differ in how often they share hazards. Here, we develop a new model to detect information concerning hazards, trained on a new collection of annotated X posts, as well as urban legends annotated in previous work. We show that not only does this model perform well (outperforming, e.g., zero-shot human annotator proxies, such as GPT-4) but that the hazard information it extracts is not strongly correlated with other indicators, namely moral outrage, sentiment, emotions, and threat words. (That said, consonant with expectations, hazard information does correlate positively with such emotions as fear, and negatively with emotions like joy.) We then apply this model to three datasets: X posts about COVID-19, X posts about the 2023 Hamas-Israel war, and a new expanded collection of urban legends. From these data, we uncover words associated with hazards unique to each dataset as well as differences in this language between groups of users, such as conservatives and liberals, which informs what these groups perceive as hazards. We further show that information about hazards peaks in frequency after major hazard events, and therefore acts as an automated indicator of such events. Finally, we find that information about hazards is especially prevalent in urban legends, which is consistent with previous work that finds that reports of hazards are more likely to be both believed and transmitted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work integrates peer-to-peer federated learning tools with NS3, a widely used network simulator, to create a novel simulator designed to allow heterogeneous device experiments in federated learning. This cross-platform adaptability addresses a critical gap in existing simulation tools, enhancing the overall utility and user experience. NS3 is leveraged to simulate WiFi dynamics to facilitate federated learning experiments with participants that move around physically during training, leading to dynamic network characteristics. Our experiments showcase the simulator's efficiency in computational resource utilization at scale, with a maximum of 450 heterogeneous devices modelled as participants in federated learning. This positions it as a valuable tool for simulation-based investigations in peer-to-peer federated learning. The framework is open source and available for use and extension to the community.</description>

      <title>Safety Control of Service Robots with LLMs and Embodied Knowledge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety limitations in service robotics across various industries have raised significant concerns about the need for robust mechanisms ensuring that robots adhere to safe practices, thereby preventing actions that might harm humans or cause property damage. Despite advances, including the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges in ensuring consistent safety in autonomous robot actions persist. In this paper, we propose a novel integration of Large Language Models with Embodied Robotic Control Prompts (ERCPs) and Embodied Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) to enhance the safety framework for service robots. ERCPs are designed as predefined instructions that ensure LLMs generate safe and precise responses. These responses are subsequently validated by EKGs, which provide a comprehensive knowledge base ensuring that the actions of the robot are continuously aligned with safety protocols, thereby promoting safer operational practices in varied contexts. Our experimental setup involved diverse real-world tasks, where robots equipped with our framework demonstrated significantly higher compliance with safety standards compared to traditional methods. This integration fosters secure human-robot interactions and positions our methodology at the forefront of AI-driven safety innovations in service robotics.</description>

      <title>I-LLM: Efficient Integer-Only Inference for Fully-Quantized Low-Bit Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as a potent technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, existing works still necessitate a considerable number of floating-point (FP) operations during inference, including additional quantization and de-quantization, as well as non-linear operators such as RMSNorm and Softmax. This limitation hinders the deployment of LLMs on the edge and cloud devices. In this paper, we identify the primary obstacle to integer-only quantization for LLMs lies in the large fluctuation of activations across channels and tokens in both linear and non-linear operations. To address this issue, we propose I-LLM, a novel integer-only fully-quantized PTQ framework tailored for LLMs. Specifically, (1) we develop Fully-Smooth Block-Reconstruction (FSBR) to aggressively smooth inter-channel variations of all activations and weights. (2) to alleviate degradation caused by inter-token variations, we introduce a novel approach called Dynamic Integer-only MatMul (DI-MatMul). This method enables dynamic quantization in full-integer matrix multiplication by dynamically quantizing the input and outputs with integer-only operations. (3) we design DI-ClippedSoftmax, DI-Exp, and DI-Normalization, which utilize bit shift to execute non-linear operators efficiently while maintaining accuracy. The experiment shows that our I-LLM achieves comparable accuracy to the FP baseline and outperforms non-integer quantization methods. For example, I-LLM can operate at W4A4 with negligible loss of accuracy. To our knowledge, we are the first to bridge the gap between integer-only quantization and LLMs. We've published our code on anonymous.4open.science, aiming to contribute to the advancement of this field.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Image: Prioritizing Visual Correlation by Contrastive Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing image-text modality alignment in Vision Language Models (VLMs) treats each text token equally in an autoregressive manner. Despite being simple and effective, this method results in sub-optimal cross-modal alignment by over-emphasizing the text tokens that are less correlated with or even contradictory with the input images. In this paper, we advocate for assigning distinct contributions for each text token based on its visual correlation. Specifically, we present by contrasting image inputs, the difference in prediction logits on each text token provides strong guidance of visual correlation. We therefore introduce Contrastive ALignment (CAL), a simple yet effective re-weighting strategy that prioritizes training visually correlated tokens. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAL consistently improves different types of VLMs across different resolutions and model sizes on various benchmark datasets. Importantly, our method incurs minimal additional computational overhead, rendering it highly efficient compared to alternative data scaling strategies. Codes are available at https://github.com/foundation-multimodal-models/CAL.</description>

      <title>MixDQ: Memory-Efficient Few-Step Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Metric-Decoupled Mixed Precision Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved significant visual generation quality. However, their significant computational and memory costs pose challenge for their application on resource-constrained mobile devices or even desktop GPUs. Recent few-step diffusion models reduces the inference time by reducing the denoising steps. However, their memory consumptions are still excessive. The Post Training Quantization (PTQ) replaces high bit-width FP representation with low-bit integer values (INT4/8) , which is an effective and efficient technique to reduce the memory cost. However, when applying to few-step diffusion models, existing quantization methods face challenges in preserving both the image quality and text alignment. To address this issue, we propose an mixed-precision quantization framework - MixDQ. Firstly, We design specialized BOS-aware quantization method for highly sensitive text embedding quantization. Then, we conduct metric-decoupled sensitivity analysis to measure the sensitivity of each layer. Finally, we develop an integer-programming-based method to conduct bit-width allocation. While existing quantization methods fall short at W8A8, MixDQ could achieve W8A8 without performance loss, and W4A8 with negligible visual degradation. Compared with FP16, we achieve 3-4x reduction in model size and memory cost, and 1.45x latency speedup.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Metric for Evaluating Unlearning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) addresses privacy concerns by removing information of `forgetting data' samples from trained models. Typically, evaluating MU methods involves comparing unlearned models to those retrained from scratch without forgetting data, using metrics such as membership inference attacks (MIA) and accuracy measurements. These evaluations implicitly assume that if the output logits of the unlearned and retrained models are similar, the unlearned model has successfully forgotten the data. Here, we challenge if this assumption is valid. In particular, we conduct a simple experiment of training only the last layer of a given original model using a novel masked-distillation technique while keeping the rest fixed. Surprisingly, simply altering the last layer yields favorable outcomes in the existing evaluation metrics, while the model does not successfully unlearn the samples or classes. For better evaluating the MU methods, we propose a metric that quantifies the residual information about forgetting data samples in intermediate features using mutual information, called information difference index or IDI for short. The IDI provides a comprehensive evaluation of MU methods by efficiently analyzing the internal structure of DNNs. Our metric is scalable to large datasets and adaptable to various model architectures. Additionally, we present COLapse-and-Align (COLA), a simple contrastive-based method that effectively unlearns intermediate features.</description>

      <title>Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</description>

Abstract: Instructing large language models (LLMs) to solve elementary school math problems has shown great success using Chain of Thought (CoT). However, the CoT approach relies on an LLM to generate a sequence of arithmetic calculations which can be prone to cascaded calculation errors. We hypothesize that an LLM should focus on extracting predicates and generating symbolic formulas from the math problem description so that the underlying calculation can be done via an external code interpreter. We investigate using LLM to generate Prolog programs to solve mathematical questions. Experimental results show that our Prolog-based arithmetic problem-solving outperforms CoT generation in the GSM8K benchmark across three distinct LLMs. In addition, given the insensitive ordering of predicates and symbolic formulas in Prolog, we propose to permute the ground truth predicates for more robust LLM training via data augmentation.</description>

      <title>White-box Multimodal Jailbreaks Against Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17894</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</description>

      <title>FlashST: A Simple and Universal Prompt-Tuning Framework for Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of traffic prediction is to accurately forecast and analyze the dynamics of transportation patterns, considering both space and time. However, the presence of distribution shift poses a significant challenge in this field, as existing models struggle to generalize well when faced with test data that significantly differs from the training distribution. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a simple and universal spatio-temporal prompt-tuning framework-FlashST, which adapts pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of diverse downstream datasets, improving generalization in diverse traffic prediction scenarios. Specifically, the FlashST framework employs a lightweight spatio-temporal prompt network for in-context learning, capturing spatio-temporal invariant knowledge and facilitating effective adaptation to diverse scenarios. Additionally, we incorporate a distribution mapping mechanism to align the data distributions of pre-training and downstream data, facilitating effective knowledge transfer in spatio-temporal forecasting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our FlashST across different spatio-temporal prediction tasks using diverse urban datasets.

      <title>Near-Infrared and Low-Rank Adaptation of Vision Transformers in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant health can be monitored dynamically using multispectral sensors that measure Near-Infrared reflectance (NIR). Despite this potential, obtaining and annotating high-resolution NIR images poses a significant challenge for training deep neural networks. Typically, large networks pre-trained on the RGB domain are utilized to fine-tune infrared images. This practice introduces a domain shift issue because of the differing visual traits between RGB and NIR images.As an alternative to fine-tuning, a method called low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables more efficient training by optimizing rank-decomposition matrices while keeping the original network weights frozen. However, existing parameter-efficient adaptation strategies for remote sensing images focus on RGB images and overlook domain shift issues in the NIR domain. Therefore, this study investigates the potential benefits of using vision transformer (ViT) backbones pre-trained in the RGB domain, with low-rank adaptation for downstream tasks in the NIR domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that employing LoRA with pre-trained ViT backbones yields the best performance for downstream tasks applied to NIR images.</description>

      <title>Cycle-YOLO: A Efficient and Robust Framework for Pavement Damage Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of modern society, traffic volume continues to increase in most countries worldwide, leading to an increase in the rate of pavement damage Therefore, the real-time and highly accurate pavement damage detection and maintenance have become the current need. In this paper, an enhanced pavement damage detection method with CycleGAN and improved YOLOv5 algorithm is presented. We selected 7644 self-collected images of pavement damage samples as the initial dataset and augmented it by CycleGAN. Due to a substantial difference between the images generated by CycleGAN and real road images, we proposed a data enhancement method based on an improved Scharr filter, CycleGAN, and Laplacian pyramid. To improve the target recognition effect on a complex background and solve the problem that the spatial pyramid pooling-fast module in the YOLOv5 network cannot handle multiscale targets, we introduced the convolutional block attention module attention mechanism and proposed the atrous spatial pyramid pooling with squeeze-and-excitation structure. In addition, we optimized the loss function of YOLOv5 by replacing the CIoU with EIoU. The experimental results showed that our algorithm achieved a precision of 0.872, recall of 0.854, and mean average precision@0.5 of 0.882 in detecting three main types of pavement damage: cracks, potholes, and patching. On the GPU, its frames per second reached 68, meeting the requirements for real-time detection. Its overall performance even exceeded the current more advanced YOLOv7 and achieved good results in practical applications, providing a basis for decision-making in pavement damage detection and prevention.</description>

      <title>OV-DQUO: Open-Vocabulary DETR with Denoising Text Query Training and Open-World Unknown Objects Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) aims to detect objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors trained on known category data tend to assign higher confidence to trained categories and confuse novel categories with background. To resolve this, we propose OV-DQUO, an \textbf{O}pen-\textbf{V}ocabulary DETR with \textbf{D}enoising text \textbf{Q}uery training and open-world \textbf{U}nknown \textbf{O}bjects supervision. Specifically, we introduce a wildcard matching method that enables the detector to learn from pairs of unknown objects recognized by the open-world detector and text embeddings with general semantics, mitigating the confidence bias between base and novel categories. Additionally, we propose a denoising text query training strategy that synthesizes additional noisy query-box pairs from open-world unknown objects to trains the detector through contrastive learning, enhancing its ability to distinguish novel objects from the background. We conducted extensive experiments on the challenging OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results of 45.6 AP50 and 39.3 mAP on novel categories respectively, without the need for additional training data.

      <title>Cost-Sensitive Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Transfer of Learning Curve Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of cost-sensitive multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization (BO) for efficient hyperparameter optimization (HPO). Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the BO when the performance improvement is not satisfactory with respect to the required computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we introduce utility, which is a function predefined by each user and describes the trade-off between cost and performance of BO. This utility function, combined with our novel acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically choose for each BO step the best configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in future, and also automatically stop the BO around the maximum utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing learning curve (LC) extrapolation methods with transfer learning, while successfully capturing the correlations between different configurations to develop a sensible surrogate function for multi-fidelity BO. We validate our algorithm on various LC datasets and found it outperform all the previous multi-fidelity BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, achieving significantly better trade-off between cost and performance of BO.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enhances Team Performance and Reduces Need for Traditional Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have transformed collaborative work processes, yet the impact on team performance remains underexplored. Here we examine the role of generative AI in enhancing or replacing traditional team dynamics using a randomized controlled experiment with 435 participants across 122 teams. We show that teams augmented with generative AI significantly outperformed those relying solely on human collaboration across various performance measures. Interestingly, teams with multiple AIs did not exhibit further gains, indicating diminishing returns with increased AI integration. Our analysis suggests that centralized AI usage by a few team members is more effective than distributed engagement. Additionally, individual-AI pairs matched the performance of conventional teams, suggesting a reduced need for traditional team structures in some contexts. However, despite this capability, individual-AI pairs still fell short of the performance levels achieved by AI-assisted teams. These findings underscore that while generative AI can replace some traditional team functions, more comprehensively integrating AI within team structures provides superior benefits, enhancing overall effectiveness beyond individual efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly complex problems. Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area.</description>

      <title>World Models for General Surgical Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent vision control systems for surgical robots should adapt to unknown and diverse objects while being robust to system disturbances. Previous methods did not meet these requirements due to mainly relying on pose estimation and feature tracking. We propose a world-model-based deep reinforcement learning framework "Grasp Anything for Surgery" (GAS), that learns a pixel-level visuomotor policy for surgical grasping, enhancing both generality and robustness. In particular, a novel method is proposed to estimate the values and uncertainties of depth pixels for a rigid-link object's inaccurate region based on the empirical prior of the object's size; both depth and mask images of task objects are encoded to a single compact 3-channel image (size: 64x64x3) by dynamically zooming in the mask regions, minimizing the information loss. The learned controller's effectiveness is extensively evaluated in simulation and in a real robot. Our learned visuomotor policy handles: i) unseen objects, including 5 types of target grasping objects and a robot gripper, in unstructured real-world surgery environments, and ii) disturbances in perception and control. Note that we are the first work to achieve a unified surgical control system that grasps diverse surgical objects using different robot grippers on real robots in complex surgery scenes (average success rate: 69%). Our system also demonstrates significant robustness across 6 conditions including background variation, target disturbance, camera pose variation, kinematic control error, image noise, and re-grasping after the gripped target object drops from the gripper. Videos and codes can be found on our project page: https://linhongbin.github.io/gas/.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Pre-training for Transferable Multi-modal Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception models leveraging inputs from multiple sensors exhibit strong robustness in degraded environments. However, these models face challenges in efficiently and effectively transferring learned representations across different modalities and tasks. This paper presents NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), a self-supervised pre-training paradigm for transferable multi-modal representation learning. NS-MAE is designed to provide pre-trained model initializations for efficient and high-performance fine-tuning. Our approach uses masked multi-modal reconstruction in neural radiance fields (NeRF), training the model to reconstruct missing or corrupted input data across multiple modalities. Specifically, multi-modal embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point clouds and images, conditioned on specific view directions and locations. These embeddings are then rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps using neural rendering techniques. The original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered feature maps, facilitating self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising transferability of NS-MAE representations across diverse multi-modal and single-modal perception models. This transferability is evaluated on various 3D perception downstream tasks, such as 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation, using different amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Our code will be released to support the community.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dynamic Topics in Chain-Free Fashion by Evolution-Tracking Contrastive Learning and Unassociated Word Exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic topic models track the evolution of topics in sequential documents, which have derived various applications like trend analysis and opinion mining. However, existing models suffer from repetitive topic and unassociated topic issues, failing to reveal the evolution and hindering further applications. To address these issues, we break the tradition of simply chaining topics in existing work and propose a novel neural \modelfullname. We introduce a new evolution-tracking contrastive learning method that builds the similarity relations among dynamic topics. This not only tracks topic evolution but also maintains topic diversity, mitigating the repetitive topic issue. To avoid unassociated topics, we further present an unassociated word exclusion method that consistently excludes unassociated words from discovered topics. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, tracking topic evolution with high-quality topics, showing better performance on downstream tasks, and remaining robust to the hyperparameter for evolution intensities.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems that model dynamic preferences based on a use's past behavior are crucial to e-commerce. Recent studies on these systems have considered various types of information such as images and texts. However, multimodal data have not yet been utilized directly to recommend products to users. In this study, we propose an attention-based sequential recommendation method that employs multimodal data of items such as images, texts, and categories. First, we extract image and text features from pre-trained VGG and BERT and convert categories into multi-labeled forms. Subsequently, attention operations are performed independent of the item sequence and multimodal representations. Finally, the individual attention information is integrated through an attention fusion function. In addition, we apply multitask learning loss for each modality to improve the generalization performance. The experimental results obtained from the Amazon datasets show that the proposed method outperforms those of conventional sequential recommendation systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

Abstract: Enhancing user engagement through personalization in conversational agents has gained significance, especially with the advent of large language models that generate fluent responses. Personalized dialogue generation, however, is multifaceted and varies in its definition -- ranging from instilling a persona in the agent to capturing users' explicit and implicit cues. This paper seeks to systemically survey the recent landscape of personalized dialogue generation, including the datasets employed, methodologies developed, and evaluation metrics applied. Covering 22 datasets, we highlight benchmark datasets and newer ones enriched with additional features. We further analyze 17 seminal works from top conferences between 2021-2023 and identify five distinct types of problems. We also shed light on recent progress by LLMs in personalized dialogue generation. Our evaluation section offers a comprehensive summary of assessment facets and metrics utilized in these works. In conclusion, we discuss prevailing challenges and envision prospect directions for future research in personalized dialogue generation.</description>

However, existing topic models generally struggle with either effectiveness, efficiency, or stability, highly impeding their practical applications. In this paper, we propose FASTopic, a fast, adaptive, stable, and transferable topic model. FASTopic follows a new paradigm: Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR). Instead of previous conventional, neural VAE-based or clustering-based methods, DSR discovers latent topics by reconstruction through modeling the semantic relations among document, topic, and word embeddings. This brings about a neat and efficient topic modeling framework. We further propose a novel Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method. Rather than early straightforward approaches, ETP explicitly regularizes the semantic relations as optimal transport plans. This addresses the relation bias issue and thus leads to effective topic modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FASTopic shows superior effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability, compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios.

      <title>VeLoRA: Memory Efficient Training using Rank-1 Sub-Token Projections</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset.</description>

      <title>fMRI predictors based on language models of increasing complexity recover brain left lateralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, studies of naturalistic language processing where participants are scanned while listening to continuous text have flourished. Using word embeddings at first, then large language models, researchers have created encoding models to analyze the brain signals. Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, we show that a left-right asymmetry gradually appears as model size increases, and that the difference in left-right brain correlations also follows a scaling law. Whereas the smallest models show no asymmetry, larger models fit better and better left hemispheric activations than right hemispheric ones. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.</description>

      <title>DMT-JEPA: Discriminative Masked Targets for Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint-embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) recently has shown impressive results in extracting visual representations from unlabeled imagery under a masking strategy. However, we reveal its disadvantages, notably its insufficient understanding of local semantics. This deficiency originates from masked modeling in the embedding space, resulting in a reduction of discriminative power and can even lead to the neglect of critical local semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce DMT-JEPA, a novel masked modeling objective rooted in JEPA, specifically designed to generate discriminative latent targets from neighboring information. Our key idea is simple: we consider a set of semantically similar neighboring patches as a target of a masked patch. To be specific, the proposed DMT-JEPA (a) computes feature similarities between each masked patch and its corresponding neighboring patches to select patches having semantically meaningful relations, and (b) employs lightweight cross-attention heads to aggregate features of neighboring patches as the masked targets. Consequently, DMT-JEPA demonstrates strong discriminative power, offering benefits across a diverse spectrum of downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our effectiveness across various visual benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K image classification, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and COCO object detection tasks.

      <title>Source Echo Chamber: Exploring the Escalation of Source Bias in User, Data, and Recommender System Feedback Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, researchers have uncovered that neural retrieval models prefer AI-generated content (AIGC), called source bias. Compared to active search behavior, recommendation represents another important means of information acquisition, where users are more prone to source bias. Furthermore, delving into the recommendation scenario, as AIGC becomes integrated within the feedback loop involving users, data, and the recommender system, it progressively contaminates the candidate items, the user interaction history, and ultimately, the data used to train the recommendation models. How and to what extent the source bias affects the neural recommendation models within feedback loop remains unknown. In this study, we extend the investigation of source bias into the realm of recommender systems, specifically examining its impact across different phases of the feedback loop. We conceptualize the progression of AIGC integration into the recommendation content ecosystem in three distinct phases-HGC dominate, HGC-AIGC coexist, and AIGC dominance-each representing past, present, and future states, respectively. Through extensive experiments across three datasets from diverse domains, we demonstrate the prevalence of source bias and reveal a potential digital echo chamber with source bias amplification throughout the feedback loop. This trend risks creating a recommender ecosystem with limited information source, such as AIGC, being disproportionately recommended. To counteract this bias and prevent its escalation in the feedback loop, we introduce a black-box debiasing method that maintains model impartiality towards both HGC and AIGC. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed debiasing method, confirming its potential to disrupt the feedback loop.</description>

      <title>MAVIN: Multi-Action Video Generation with Diffusion Models via Transition Video Infilling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation has achieved significant progress, yet generating multiple actions that occur sequentially remains a formidable task. Directly generating a video with sequential actions can be extremely challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained action annotations and the difficulty in establishing temporal semantic correspondences and maintaining long-term consistency. To tackle this, we propose an intuitive and straightforward solution: splicing multiple single-action video segments sequentially. The core challenge lies in generating smooth and natural transitions between these segments given the inherent complexity and variability of action transitions. We introduce MAVIN (Multi-Action Video INfilling model), designed to generate transition videos that seamlessly connect two given videos, forming a cohesive integrated sequence. MAVIN incorporates several innovative techniques to address challenges in the transition video infilling task. Firstly, a consecutive noising strategy coupled with variable-length sampling is employed to handle large infilling gaps and varied generation lengths. Secondly, boundary frame guidance (BFG) is proposed to address the lack of semantic guidance during transition generation. Lastly, a Gaussian filter mixer (GFM) dynamically manages noise initialization during inference, mitigating train-test discrepancy while preserving generation flexibility. Additionally, we introduce a new metric, CLIP-RS (CLIP Relative Smoothness), to evaluate temporal coherence and smoothness, complementing traditional quality-based metrics. Experimental results on horse and tiger scenarios demonstrate MAVIN's superior performance in generating smooth and coherent video transitions compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Diffusion Features For Personalized Segmentation and Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</description>

      <title>Edinburgh Clinical NLP at MEDIQA-CORR 2024: Guiding Large Language Models with Hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MEDIQA-CORR 2024 shared task aims to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and correct medical errors in clinical notes. In this study, we evaluate the capability of general LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to identify and correct medical errors with multiple prompting strategies. Recognising the limitation of LLMs in generating accurate corrections only via prompting strategies, we propose incorporating error-span predictions from a smaller, fine-tuned model in two ways: 1) by presenting it as a hint in the prompt and 2) by framing it as multiple-choice questions from which the LLM can choose the best correction. We found that our proposed prompting strategies significantly improve the LLM's ability to generate corrections. Our best-performing solution with 8-shot + CoT + hints ranked sixth in the shared task leaderboard. Additionally, our comprehensive analyses show the impact of the location of the error sentence, the prompted role, and the position of the multiple-choice option on the accuracy of the LLM. This prompts further questions about the readiness of LLM to be implemented in real-world clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Fast-FedUL: A Training-Free Federated Unlearning with Provable Skew Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a compelling machine learning paradigm, prioritizing the protection of privacy for training data. The increasing demand to address issues such as ``the right to be forgotten'' and combat data poisoning attacks highlights the importance of techniques, known as \textit{unlearning}, which facilitate the removal of specific training data from trained FL models. Despite numerous unlearning methods proposed for centralized learning, they often prove inapplicable to FL due to fundamental differences in the operation of the two learning paradigms. Consequently, unlearning in FL remains in its early stages, presenting several challenges. Many existing unlearning solutions in FL require a costly retraining process, which can be burdensome for clients. Moreover, these methods are primarily validated through experiments, lacking theoretical assurances. In this study, we introduce Fast-FedUL, a tailored unlearning method for FL, which eliminates the need for retraining entirely. Through meticulous analysis of the target client's influence on the global model in each round, we develop an algorithm to systematically remove the impact of the target client from the trained model. In addition to presenting empirical findings, we offer a theoretical analysis delineating the upper bound of our unlearned model and the exact retrained model (the one obtained through retraining using untargeted clients). Experimental results with backdoor attack scenarios indicate that Fast-FedUL effectively removes almost all traces of the target client, while retaining the knowledge of untargeted clients (obtaining a high accuracy of up to 98\% on the main task). Significantly, Fast-FedUL attains the lowest time complexity, providing a speed that is 1000 times faster than retraining. Our source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/thanhtrunghuynh93/fastFedUL}.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Insights and Stable Coalition Matching for Fostering Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive abilities, such as Theory of Mind (ToM), play a vital role in facilitating cooperation in human social interactions. However, our study reveals that agents with higher ToM abilities may not necessarily exhibit better cooperative behavior compared to those with lower ToM abilities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel matching coalition mechanism that leverages the strengths of agents with different ToM levels by explicitly considering belief alignment and specialized abilities when forming coalitions. Our proposed matching algorithm seeks to find stable coalitions that maximize the potential for cooperative behavior and ensure long-term viability. By incorporating cognitive insights into the design of multi-agent systems, our work demonstrates the potential of leveraging ToM to create more sophisticated and human-like coordination strategies that foster cooperation and improve overall system performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) grow in size and complexity, they often exceed the memory capacity of a single accelerator, necessitating the sharding of model parameters across multiple accelerators. Pipeline parallelism is a commonly used sharding strategy for training large DNNs. However, current implementations of pipeline parallelism are being unintentionally bottlenecked by the automatic differentiation tools provided by ML frameworks. This paper introduces 2-stage backpropagation (2BP). By splitting the backward propagation step into two separate stages, we can reduce idle compute time. We tested 2BP on various model architectures and pipelining schedules, achieving increases in throughput in all cases. Using 2BP, we were able to achieve a 1.70x increase in throughput compared to traditional methods when training a LLaMa-like transformer with 7 billion parameters across 4 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Link Anomaly Detection in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning-based approaches. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.</description>

      <title>EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</description>

Abstract: Empirical research plays a fundamental role in the machine learning domain. At the heart of impactful empirical research lies the development of clear research hypotheses, which then shape the design of experiments. The execution of experiments must be carried out with precision to ensure reliable results, followed by statistical analysis to interpret these outcomes. This process is key to either supporting or refuting initial hypotheses. Despite its importance, there is a high variability in research practices across the machine learning community and no uniform understanding of quality criteria for empirical research. To address this gap, we propose a model for the empirical research process, accompanied by guidelines to uphold the validity of empirical research. By embracing these recommendations, greater consistency, enhanced reliability and increased impact can be achieved.</description>

Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective exploration is critical, especially in sparse reward environments. Although introducing global intrinsic rewards can foster exploration in such settings, it often complicates credit assignment among agents. To address this difficulty, we propose Individual Contributions as intrinsic Exploration Scaffolds (ICES), a novel approach to motivate exploration by assessing each agent's contribution from a global view. In particular, ICES constructs exploration scaffolds with Bayesian surprise, leveraging global transition information during centralized training. These scaffolds, used only in training, help to guide individual agents towards actions that significantly impact the global latent state transitions. Additionally, ICES separates exploration policies from exploitation policies, enabling the former to utilize privileged global information during training. Extensive experiments on cooperative benchmark tasks with sparse rewards, including Google Research Football (GRF) and StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC), demonstrate that ICES exhibits superior exploration capabilities compared with baselines.

      <title>Facilitating Multi-Role and Multi-Behavior Collaboration of Large Language Models for Online Job Seeking and Recruiting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18113</link>

Abstract: The emergence of online recruitment services has revolutionized the traditional landscape of job seeking and recruitment, necessitating the development of high-quality industrial applications to improve person-job fitting. Existing methods generally rely on modeling the latent semantics of resumes and job descriptions and learning a matching function between them. Inspired by the powerful role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose to introduce a mock interview process between LLM-played interviewers and candidates. The mock interview conversations can provide additional evidence for candidate evaluation, thereby augmenting traditional person-job fitting based solely on resumes and job descriptions. However, characterizing these two roles in online recruitment still presents several challenges, such as developing the skills to raise interview questions, formulating appropriate answers, and evaluating two-sided fitness. To this end, we propose MockLLM, a novel applicable framework that divides the person-job matching process into two modules: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol, jointly enhancing their performance through collaborative behaviors between interviewers and candidates. We design a role-playing framework as a multi-role and multi-behavior paradigm to enable a single LLM agent to effectively behave with multiple functions for both parties. Moreover, we propose reflection memory generation and dynamic prompt modification techniques to refine the behaviors of both sides, enabling continuous optimization of the augmented additional evidence. Extensive experimental results show that MockLLM can achieve the best performance on person-job matching accompanied by high mock interview quality, envisioning its emerging application in real online recruitment in the future.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Crop Classification from Multi-Spectral Time Series Using Lossless Compressors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping.

      <title>Exploiting LLM Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization leverages lower-precision weights to reduce the memory usage of large language models (LLMs) and is a key technique for enabling their deployment on commodity hardware. While LLM quantization's impact on utility has been extensively explored, this work for the first time studies its adverse effects from a security perspective. We reveal that widely used quantization methods can be exploited to produce a harmful quantized LLM, even though the full-precision counterpart appears benign, potentially tricking users into deploying the malicious quantized model. We demonstrate this threat using a three-staged attack framework: (i) first, we obtain a malicious LLM through fine-tuning on an adversarial task; (ii) next, we quantize the malicious model and calculate constraints that characterize all full-precision models that map to the same quantized model; (iii) finally, using projected gradient descent, we tune out the poisoned behavior from the full-precision model while ensuring that its weights satisfy the constraints computed in step (ii). This procedure results in an LLM that exhibits benign behavior in full precision but when quantized, it follows the adversarial behavior injected in step (i). We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and severity of such an attack across three diverse scenarios: vulnerable code generation, content injection, and over-refusal attack. In practice, the adversary could host the resulting full-precision model on an LLM community hub such as Hugging Face, exposing millions of users to the threat of deploying its malicious quantized version on their devices.</description>

      <title>4-bit Shampoo for Memory-Efficient Network Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order optimizers, maintaining a matrix termed a preconditioner, are superior to first-order optimizers in both theory and practice. The states forming the preconditioner and its inverse root restrict the maximum size of models trained by second-order optimizers. To address this, compressing 32-bit optimizer states to lower bitwidths has shown promise in reducing memory usage. However, current approaches only pertain to first-order optimizers. In this paper, we propose the first 4-bit second-order optimizers, exemplified by 4-bit Shampoo, maintaining performance similar to that of 32-bit ones. We show that quantizing the eigenvector matrix of the preconditioner in 4-bit Shampoo is remarkably better than quantizing the preconditioner itself both theoretically and experimentally. By rectifying the orthogonality of the quantized eigenvector matrix, we enhance the approximation of the preconditioner's eigenvector matrix, which also benefits the computation of its inverse 4-th root. Besides, we find that linear square quantization slightly outperforms dynamic tree quantization when quantizing second-order optimizer states. Evaluation on various networks for image classification demonstrates that our 4-bit Shampoo achieves comparable test accuracy to its 32-bit counterpart while being more memory-efficient. The source code will be made available.</description>

      <title>Learning to Detour: Shortcut Mitigating Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) employing weak forms of labels has been actively studied to alleviate the annotation cost of acquiring pixel-level labels. However, classifiers trained on biased datasets tend to exploit shortcut features and make predictions based on spurious correlations between certain backgrounds and objects, leading to a poor generalization performance. In this paper, we propose shortcut mitigating augmentation (SMA) for WSSS, which generates synthetic representations of object-background combinations not seen in the training data to reduce the use of shortcut features. Our approach disentangles the object-relevant and background features. We then shuffle and combine the disentangled representations to create synthetic features of diverse object-background combinations. SMA-trained classifier depends less on contexts and focuses more on the target object when making predictions. In addition, we analyzed the behavior of the classifier on shortcut usage after applying our augmentation using an attribution method-based metric. The proposed method achieved the improved performance of semantic segmentation result on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets.</description>

      <title>Back to the Drawing Board for Fair Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of Fair Representation Learning (FRL) is to mitigate biases in machine learning models by learning data representations that enable high accuracy on downstream tasks while minimizing discrimination based on sensitive attributes. The evaluation of FRL methods in many recent works primarily focuses on the tradeoff between downstream fairness and accuracy with respect to a single task that was used to approximate the utility of representations during training (proxy task). This incentivizes retaining only features relevant to the proxy task while discarding all other information. In extreme cases, this can cause the learned representations to collapse to a trivial, binary value, rendering them unusable in transfer settings. In this work, we argue that this approach is fundamentally mismatched with the original motivation of FRL, which arises from settings with many downstream tasks unknown at training time (transfer tasks). To remedy this, we propose to refocus the evaluation protocol of FRL methods primarily around the performance on transfer tasks. A key challenge when conducting such an evaluation is the lack of adequate benchmarks. We address this by formulating four criteria that a suitable evaluation procedure should fulfill. Based on these, we propose TransFair, a benchmark that satisfies these criteria, consisting of novel variations of popular FRL datasets with carefully calibrated transfer tasks. In this setting, we reevaluate state-of-the-art FRL methods, observing that they often overfit to the proxy task, which causes them to underperform on certain transfer tasks. We further highlight the importance of task-agnostic learning signals for FRL methods, as they can lead to more transferrable representations.</description>

      <title>Time Series Representation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

      <title>AnyFit: Controllable Virtual Try-on for Any Combination of Attire Across Any Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit's impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community.</description>

      <title>Render and Diffuse: Aligning Image and Action Spaces for Diffusion-based Behaviour Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of Robot Learning, the complex mapping between high-dimensional observations such as RGB images and low-level robotic actions, two inherently very different spaces, constitutes a complex learning problem, especially with limited amounts of data. In this work, we introduce Render and Diffuse (R&amp;D) a method that unifies low-level robot actions and RGB observations within the image space using virtual renders of the 3D model of the robot. Using this joint observation-action representation it computes low-level robot actions using a learnt diffusion process that iteratively updates the virtual renders of the robot. This space unification simplifies the learning problem and introduces inductive biases that are crucial for sample efficiency and spatial generalisation. We thoroughly evaluate several variants of R&amp;D in simulation and showcase their applicability on six everyday tasks in the real world. Our results show that R&amp;D exhibits strong spatial generalisation capabilities and is more sample efficient than more common image-to-action methods.</description>

      <title>Active Use of Latent Constituency Representation in both Humans and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how sentences are internally represented in the human brain, as well as in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, is a major challenge for cognitive science. Classic linguistic theories propose that the brain represents a sentence by parsing it into hierarchically organized constituents. In contrast, LLMs do not explicitly parse linguistic constituents and their latent representations remains poorly explained. Here, we demonstrate that humans and LLMs construct similar latent representations of hierarchical linguistic constituents by analyzing their behaviors during a novel one-shot learning task, in which they infer which words should be deleted from a sentence. Both humans and LLMs tend to delete a constituent, instead of a nonconstituent word string. In contrast, a naive sequence processing model that has access to word properties and ordinal positions does not show this property. Based on the word deletion behaviors, we can reconstruct the latent constituency tree representation of a sentence for both humans and LLMs. These results demonstrate that a latent tree-structured constituency representation can emerge in both the human brain and LLMs.</description>

      <title>Text-only Synthesis for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From paired image-text training to text-only training for image captioning, the pursuit of relaxing the requirements for high-cost and large-scale annotation of good quality data remains consistent. In this paper, we propose Text-only Synthesis for Image Captioning (ToCa), which further advances this relaxation with fewer human labor and less computing time. Specifically, we deconstruct caption text into structures and lexical words, which serve as the fundamental components of the caption. By combining different structures and lexical words as inputs to the large language model, massive captions that contain various patterns of lexical words are generated. This method not only approaches the target domain but also surpasses it by generating new captions, thereby enhancing the zero-shot generalization ability of the model. Considering the different levels of data access in the real world, we define three synthesis scenarios: cross-domain synthesis, in-domain synthesis, and data-efficient synthesis. Experiments in these scenarios demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and practicability of ToCa with a nearly 5 CIDEr improvement for zero-shot cross-domain captioning and a maximum increase of over 20 CIDEr for data-efficient captioning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online deep learning solves the problem of learning from streams of data, reconciling two opposing objectives: learn fast and learn deep. Existing work focuses almost exclusively on exploring pure deep learning solutions, which are much better suited to handle the "deep" than the "fast" part of the online learning equation. In our work, we propose a different paradigm, based on a hybrid multilearner approach. First, we develop a fast online logistic regression learner. This learner does not rely on backpropagation. Instead, it uses closed form recursive updates of model parameters, handling the fast learning part of the online learning problem. We then analyze the existing online deep learning theory and show that the widespread ODL approach, currently operating at complexity $O(L^2)$ in terms of the number of layers $L$, can be equivalently implemented in $O(L)$ complexity. This further leads us to the cascaded multilearner design, in which multiple shallow and deep learners are co-trained to solve the online learning problem in a cooperative, synergistic fashion. We show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results on common online learning datasets, while also being able to handle missing features gracefully. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonValk/MODL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from multi-step off-policy data collected by a set of policies is a core problem of reinforcement learning (RL). Approaches based on importance sampling (IS) often suffer from large variances due to products of IS ratios. Typical IS-free methods, such as $n$-step Q-learning, look ahead for $n$ time steps along the trajectory of actions (where $n$ is called the lookahead depth) and utilize off-policy data directly without any additional adjustment. They work well for proper choices of $n$. We show, however, that such IS-free methods underestimate the optimal value function (VF), especially for large $n$, restricting their capacity to efficiently utilize information from distant future time steps. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel, IS-free, multi-step off-policy method that avoids the underestimation issue and converges to the optimal VF. At its core lies a simple but non-trivial \emph{highway gate}, which controls the information flow from the distant future by comparing it to a threshold. The highway gate guarantees convergence to the optimal VF for arbitrary $n$ and arbitrary behavioral policies. It gives rise to a novel family of off-policy RL algorithms that safely learn even when $n$ is very large, facilitating rapid credit assignment from the far future to the past. On tasks with greatly delayed rewards, including video games where the reward is given only at the end of the game, our new methods outperform many existing multi-step off-policy algorithms.</description>

      <title>FedSAC: Dynamic Submodel Allocation for Collaborative Fairness in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative fairness stands as an essential element in federated learning to encourage client participation by equitably distributing rewards based on individual contributions. Existing methods primarily focus on adjusting gradient allocations among clients to achieve collaborative fairness. However, they frequently overlook crucial factors such as maintaining consistency across local models and catering to the diverse requirements of high-contributing clients. This oversight inevitably decreases both fairness and model accuracy in practice. To address these issues, we propose FedSAC, a novel Federated learning framework with dynamic Submodel Allocation for Collaborative fairness, backed by a theoretical convergence guarantee. First, we present the concept of "bounded collaborative fairness (BCF)", which ensures fairness by tailoring rewards to individual clients based on their contributions. Second, to implement the BCF, we design a submodel allocation module with a theoretical guarantee of fairness. This module incentivizes high-contributing clients with high-performance submodels containing a diverse range of crucial neurons, thereby preserving consistency across local models. Third, we further develop a dynamic aggregation module to adaptively aggregate submodels, ensuring the equitable treatment of low-frequency neurons and consequently enhancing overall model accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on three public benchmarks demonstrate that FedSAC outperforms all baseline methods in both fairness and model accuracy. We see this work as a significant step towards incentivizing broader client participation in federated learning. The source code is available at https://github.com/wangzihuixmu/FedSAC.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Innovations for Underwater Waste Detection: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the issue of submerged underwater trash is crucial for safeguarding aquatic ecosystems and preserving marine life. While identifying debris present on the surface of water bodies is straightforward, assessing the underwater submerged waste is a challenge due to the image distortions caused by factors such as light refraction, absorption, suspended particles, color shifts, and occlusion. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art architectures and on the existing datasets to establish a baseline for submerged waste and trash detection. The primary goal remains to establish the benchmark of the object localization techniques to be leveraged by advanced underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles. The ultimate objective is to explore the underwater environment, to identify, and remove underwater debris. The absence of benchmarks (dataset or algorithm) in many researches emphasizes the need for a more robust algorithmic solution. Through this research, we aim to give performance comparative analysis of various underwater trash detection algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SSL-HV: Self-Supervised Learning approaches applied to the task of Handwriting Verification. This task involves determining whether a given pair of handwritten images originate from the same or different writer distribution. We have compared the performance of multiple generative, contrastive SSL approaches against handcrafted feature extractors and supervised learning on CEDAR AND dataset. We show that ResNet based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) outperforms other generative approaches achieving 76.3% accuracy, while ResNet-18 fine-tuned using Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) outperforms other contrastive approaches achieving 78% accuracy. Using a pre-trained VAE and VICReg for the downstream task of writer verification we observed a relative improvement in accuracy of 6.7% and 9% over ResNet-18 supervised baseline with 10% writer labels.</description>

      <title>SCE-MAE: Selective Correspondence Enhancement with Masked Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Landmark Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised landmark estimation is a challenging task that demands the formation of locally distinct feature representations to identify sparse facial landmarks in the absence of annotated data. To tackle this task, existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (1) extract coarse features from backbones that are trained with instance-level self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, which neglect the dense prediction nature of the task, (2) aggregate them into memory-intensive hypercolumn formations, and (3) supervise lightweight projector networks to naively establish full local correspondences among all pairs of spatial features. In this paper, we introduce SCE-MAE, a framework that (1) leverages the MAE, a region-level SSL method that naturally better suits the landmark prediction task, (2) operates on the vanilla feature map instead of on expensive hypercolumns, and (3) employs a Correspondence Approximation and Refinement Block (CARB) that utilizes a simple density peak clustering algorithm and our proposed Locality-Constrained Repellence Loss to directly hone only select local correspondences. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SCE-MAE is highly effective and robust, outperforming existing SOTA methods by large margins of approximately 20%-44% on the landmark matching and approximately 9%-15% on the landmark detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Histopathology Based AI Model Predicts Anti-Angiogenic Therapy Response in Renal Cancer Clinical Trial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive biomarkers of treatment response are lacking for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a tumor type that is treated with angiogenesis inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and a HIF2 inhibitor. The Angioscore, an RNA-based quantification of angiogenesis, is arguably the best candidate to predict anti-angiogenic (AA) response. However, the clinical adoption of transcriptomic assays faces several challenges including standardization, time delay, and high cost. Further, ccRCC tumors are highly heterogenous, and sampling multiple areas for sequencing is impractical. Here we present a novel deep learning (DL) approach to predict the Angioscore from ubiquitous histopathology slides. To overcome the lack of interpretability, one of the biggest limitations of typical DL models, our model produces a visual vascular network which is the basis of the model's prediction. To test its reliability, we applied this model to multiple cohorts including a clinical trial dataset. Our model accurately predicts the RNA-based Angioscore on multiple independent cohorts (spearman correlations of 0.77 and 0.73). Further, the predictions help unravel meaningful biology such as association of angiogenesis with grade, stage, and driver mutation status. Finally, we find our model can predict response to AA therapy, in both a real-world cohort and the IMmotion150 clinical trial. The predictive power of our model vastly exceeds that of CD31, a marker of vasculature, and nearly rivals the performance (c-index 0.66 vs 0.67) of the ground truth RNA-based Angioscore at a fraction of the cost. By providing a robust yet interpretable prediction of the Angioscore from histopathology slides alone, our approach offers insights into angiogenesis biology and AA treatment response.</description>

      <title>Frustratingly Easy Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models seamlessly discriminate among arbitrary semantic categories, yet they still suffer from poor generalization when presented with challenging examples. For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with "zero" temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10x faster and 13x more memory-friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field.

      <title>Interpretable classification of wiki-review streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wiki articles are created and maintained by a crowd of editors, producing a continuous stream of reviews. Reviews can take the form of additions, reverts, or both. This crowdsourcing model is exposed to manipulation since neither reviews nor editors are automatically screened and purged. To protect articles against vandalism or damage, the stream of reviews can be mined to classify reviews and profile editors in real-time. The goal of this work is to anticipate and explain which reviews to revert. This way, editors are informed why their edits will be reverted. The proposed method employs stream-based processing, updating the profiling and classification models on each incoming event. The profiling uses side and content-based features employing Natural Language Processing, and editor profiles are incrementally updated based on their reviews. Since the proposed method relies on self-explainable classification algorithms, it is possible to understand why a review has been classified as a revert or a non-revert. In addition, this work contributes an algorithm for generating synthetic data for class balancing, making the final classification fairer. The proposed online method was tested with a real data set from Wikivoyage, which was balanced through the aforementioned synthetic data generation. The results attained near-90 % values for all evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure).</description>

      <title>A System for Automatic English Text Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an automatic text expansion system to generate English sentences, which performs automatic Natural Language Generation (NLG) by combining linguistic rules with statistical approaches. Here, "automatic" means that the system can generate coherent and correct sentences from a minimum set of words. From its inception, the design is modular and adaptable to other languages. This adaptability is one of its greatest advantages. For English, we have created the highly precise aLexiE lexicon with wide coverage, which represents a contribution on its own. We have evaluated the resulting NLG library in an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) proof of concept, both directly (by regenerating corpus sentences) and manually (from annotations) using a popular corpus in the NLG field. We performed a second analysis by comparing the quality of text expansion in English to Spanish, using an ad-hoc Spanish-English parallel corpus. The system might also be applied to other domains such as report and news generation.</description>

      <title>MMCTAgent: Multi-modal Critical Thinking Agent Framework for Complex Visual Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their performance in tasks combining vision and language. However, challenges persist in detailed multi-modal understanding, comprehension of complex tasks, and reasoning over multi-modal information. This paper introduces MMCTAgent, a novel multi-modal critical thinking agent framework designed to address the inherent limitations of current MLLMs in complex visual reasoning tasks. Inspired by human cognitive processes and critical thinking, MMCTAgent iteratively analyzes multi-modal information, decomposes queries, plans strategies, and dynamically evolves its reasoning. Additionally, MMCTAgent incorporates critical thinking elements such as verification of final answers and self-reflection through a novel approach that defines a vision-based critic and identifies task-specific evaluation criteria, thereby enhancing its decision-making abilities. Through rigorous evaluations across various image and video understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that MMCTAgent (with and without the critic) outperforms both foundational MLLMs and other tool-augmented pipelines.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Dynamic Learning Strategies for Improving Multilingual Performance in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are at the forefront of transforming numerous domains globally. However, their inclusivity and effectiveness remain limited for non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages. This paper tackles the imperative challenge of enhancing the multilingual performance of LLMs without extensive training or fine-tuning. Through systematic investigation and evaluation of diverse languages using popular question-answering (QA) datasets, we present novel techniques that unlock the true potential of LLMs in a polyglot landscape. Our approach encompasses three key strategies that yield significant improvements in multilingual proficiency. First, by meticulously optimizing prompts tailored for polyglot LLMs, we unlock their latent capabilities, resulting in substantial performance boosts across languages. Second, we introduce a new hybrid approach that synergizes LLM Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multilingual embeddings and achieves improved multilingual task performance. Finally, we introduce a novel learning approach that dynamically selects the optimal prompt strategy, LLM model, and embedding model per query at run-time. This dynamic adaptation maximizes the efficacy of LLMs across languages, outperforming best static and random strategies. Additionally, our approach adapts configurations in both offline and online settings, and can seamlessly adapt to new languages and datasets, leading to substantial advancements in multilingual understanding and generation across diverse languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains, showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting, which guides model output generation. However, manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific, necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard, a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples, maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic, synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities, including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data, and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizard's superiority over existing prompt strategies, showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.</description>

      <title>OwLore: Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks. However, the substantial size of LLMs presents significant challenges in training or fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have gained popularity, they often compromise performance compared to full-rank fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose Outlier-weighed Layerwise Sampled Low-Rank Projection (OwLore), a new memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, inspired by the layerwise outlier distribution of LLMs, which dynamically samples pre-trained layers to fine-tune instead of adding additional adaptors. We first interpret the outlier phenomenon through the lens of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization theory (HT-SR), discovering that layers with more outliers tend to be more heavy-tailed and consequently better trained. Inspired by this finding, OwLore strategically assigns higher sampling probabilities to layers with more outliers to better leverage the knowledge stored in pre-trained LLMs. To further mitigate the memory demands of fine-tuning, we integrate gradient low-rank projection into our approach, which facilitates each layer to be efficiently trained in a low-rank manner. By incorporating the efficient characteristics of low-rank and optimal layerwise sampling, OwLore significantly improves the memory-performance trade-off in LLM pruning. Our extensive experiments across various architectures, including LLaMa2, LLaMa3, and Mistral, demonstrate that OwLore consistently outperforms baseline approaches, including full fine-tuning. Specifically, it achieves up to a 1.1% average accuracy gain on the Commonsense Reasoning benchmark, a 3.0% improvement on MMLU, and a notable 10% boost on MT-Bench, while being more memory efficient. OwLore allows us to fine-tune LLaMa2-7B with only 21GB of memory.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024: Meningioma Radiotherapy Planning Automated Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation Meningioma Radiotherapy (BraTS-MEN-RT) challenge aims to advance automated segmentation algorithms using the largest known multi-institutional dataset of radiotherapy planning brain MRIs with expert-annotated target labels for patients with intact or post-operative meningioma that underwent either conventional external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Each case includes a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label "target volume" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk post-operative site. Target volume annotations adhere to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions. For pre-operative meningiomas, the target volume encompasses the entire GTV and associated nodular dural tail, while for post-operative cases, it includes at-risk resection cavity margins as determined by the treating institution. Case annotations were reviewed and approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Participating teams will develop, containerize, and evaluate automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Model performance will be assessed using the lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and the 95% Hausdorff distance. The top-performing teams will be recognized at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference in October 2024. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.</description>

      <title>A Review and Implementation of Object Detection Models and Optimizations for Real-time Medical Mask Detection during the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonly used for the problem of object detection thanks to their increased accuracy. Nevertheless, the performance of CNN-based detection models is ambiguous when detection speed is considered. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been sufficient evaluation of the available methods in terms of the speed/accuracy trade-off in related literature. This work assesses the most fundamental object detection models on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset with respect to this trade-off, their memory consumption, and computational and storage cost. Next, we select a highly efficient model called YOLOv5 to train on the topical and unexplored dataset of human faces with medical masks, the Properly-Wearing Masked Faces Dataset (PWMFD), and analyze the benefits of specific optimization techniques for real-time medical mask detection: transfer learning, data augmentations, and a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. Using our findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose an optimized model based on YOLOv5s using transfer learning for the detection of correctly and incorrectly worn medical masks that surpassed more than two times in speed (69 frames per second) the state-of-the-art model SE-YOLOv3 on the PWMFD dataset while maintaining the same level of mean Average Precision (67%).</description>

      <title>MC-GTA: Metric-Constrained Model-Based Clustering using Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering with given metric constraints. Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e., metric autocorrelation. The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure. In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm, MC-GTA (Model-based Clustering via Goodness-of-fit Tests with Autocorrelations). Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram). We show that MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from the same distribution. Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation. It outperforms strong baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and stabler optimization (&gt;10x speedup).</description>

      <title>WIDIn: Wording Image for Domain-Invariant Representation in Single-Source Domain Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language has been useful in extending the vision encoder to data from diverse distributions without empirical discovery in training domains. However, as the image description is mostly at coarse-grained level and ignores visual details, the resulted embeddings are still ineffective in overcoming complexity of domains at inference time. We present a self-supervision framework WIDIn, Wording Images for Domain-Invariant representation, to disentangle discriminative visual representation, by only leveraging data in a single domain and without any test prior. Specifically, for each image, we first estimate the language embedding with fine-grained alignment, which can be consequently used to adaptively identify and then remove domain-specific counterpart from the raw visual embedding. WIDIn can be applied to both pretrained vision-language models like CLIP, and separately trained uni-modal models like MoCo and BERT. Experimental studies on three domain generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>RACCooN: Remove, Add, and Change Video Content with Auto-Generated Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. It supports the addition of video objects, inpainting, and attribute modification within a unified framework, surpassing existing video editing and inpainting benchmarks. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</description>

      <title>Don't Forget to Connect! Improving RAG with Graph-based Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has greatly improved the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses by grounding generation with context from existing documents. These systems work well when documents are clearly relevant to a question context. But what about when a document has partial information, or less obvious connections to the context? And how should we reason about connections between documents? In this work, we seek to answer these two core questions about RAG generation. We introduce G-RAG, a reranker based on graph neural networks (GNNs) between the retriever and reader in RAG. Our method combines both connections between documents and semantic information (via Abstract Meaning Representation graphs) to provide a context-informed ranker for RAG. G-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while having smaller computational footprint. Additionally, we assess the performance of PaLM 2 as a reranker and find it to significantly underperform G-RAG. This result emphasizes the importance of reranking for RAG even when using Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>Why are Visually-Grounded Language Models Bad at Image Classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the VLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset.</description>

      <title>ViG: Linear-complexity Visual Sequence Learning with Gated Linear Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have achieved modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers on a variety of computer vision tasks, while using fewer FLOPs and less memory. However, their advantage in terms of actual runtime speed is not significant. To address this issue, we introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its superior hardware-awareness and efficiency. We propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to adaptively inject 2D local details into 1D global context. Our hardware-aware implementation further merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. The proposed model, \name{}, offers a favorable trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. Notably, \name{}-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27\% of the parameters and 20\% of the FLOPs, running 2$\times$ faster on $224\times224$ images. At $1024\times1024$ resolution, \name{}-T uses 5.2$\times$ fewer FLOPs, saves 90\% GPU memory, runs 4.8$\times$ faster, and achieves 20.7\% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T. These results position \name{} as an efficient and scalable solution for visual representation learning. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/ViG}.</description>

      <title>GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing 4D scenes from video inputs is a crucial yet challenging task. Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view video inputs, known camera parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax all these constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task, which we termed as AnyV4D: we assume only one monocular video is available without any camera parameters as input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside the camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time. GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts, then applies a sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since dynamic scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a new pixel-wise densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new visual content. Moreover, GFlow transcends the boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also enables tracking of any points across frames without the need for prior training and segments moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way. Additionally, the camera poses of each frame can be derived from GFlow, allowing for rendering novel views of a video scene through changing camera pose. By employing the explicit representation, we may readily conduct scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring its versatility and power.

      <title>Classifying Overlapping Gaussian Mixtures in High Dimensions: From Optimal Classifiers to Neural Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive closed-form expressions for the Bayes optimal decision boundaries in binary classification of high dimensional overlapping Gaussian mixture model (GMM) data, and show how they depend on the eigenstructure of the class covariances, for particularly interesting structured data. We empirically demonstrate, through experiments on synthetic GMMs inspired by real-world data, that deep neural networks trained for classification, learn predictors which approximate the derived optimal classifiers. We further extend our study to networks trained on authentic data, observing that decision thresholds correlate with the covariance eigenvectors rather than the eigenvalues, mirroring our GMM analysis. This provides theoretical insights regarding neural networks' ability to perform probabilistic inference and distill statistical patterns from intricate distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models with large-scale pre-training have achieved significant success in the field of visual content generation, particularly exemplified by Diffusion Transformers (DiT). However, DiT models have faced challenges with scalability and quadratic complexity efficiency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the long sequence modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers, expanding its applicability to diffusion models. We introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead, following the DiT design, but offering superior efficiency and effectiveness. In addition to better performance than DiT, DiG-S/2 exhibits $2.5\times$ higher training speed than DiT-S/2 and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory at a resolution of $1792 \times 1792$. Moreover, we analyze the scalability of DiG across a variety of computational complexity. DiG models, with increased depth/width or augmentation of input tokens, consistently exhibit decreasing FID. We further compare DiG with other subquadratic-time diffusion models. With the same model size, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the recent Mamba-based diffusion model at a $1024$ resolution, and is $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with CUDA-optimized FlashAttention-2 under the $2048$ resolution. All these results demonstrate its superior efficiency among the latest diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiG.</description>

Abstract: An imperfect-information game is a type of game with asymmetric information. It is more common in life than perfect-information game. Artificial intelligence (AI) in imperfect-information games, such like poker, has made considerable progress and success in recent years. The great success of superhuman poker AI, such as Libratus and Deepstack, attracts researchers to pay attention to poker research. However, the lack of open-source code limits the development of Texas hold'em AI to some extent. This article introduces DecisionHoldem, a high-level AI for heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em with safe depth-limited subgame solving by considering possible ranges of opponent's private hands to reduce the exploitability of the strategy. Experimental results show that DecisionHoldem defeats the strongest openly available agent in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker, namely Slumbot, and a high-level reproduction of Deepstack, viz, Openstack, by more than 730 mbb/h (one-thousandth big blind per round) and 700 mbb/h. Moreover, we release the source codes and tools of DecisionHoldem to promote AI development in imperfect-information games.</description>

      <title>SwapMoE: Serving Off-the-shelf MoE-based Language Models with Tunable Memory Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) is a popular technique to improve capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with conditionally-activated parallel experts. However, serving MoE models on memory-constrained devices is challenging due to the large parameter size. Typical solutions such as memory swapping or expert pruning may lead to significantly higher latency or severe accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce SwapMoE, a framework for efficient serving of MoE-based large language models with tunable memory budgets. The main idea of SwapMoE is to keep a small dynamic set of important experts, namely Virtual Experts, in the main memory for inference, while seamlessly maintaining how the Virtual Experts map to the actual experts. Experiments have shown that SwapMoE can reduce the memory footprint while maintaining reasonable accuracy. For example, on text summarization tasks with Switch Transformer, SwapMoE can reduce the memory consumption from 14.2 GiB to 4.7 GiB, together with 50\% latency reduction and a slight Rouge-2 score drop of 0.041.</description>

Abstract: We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of Embodied AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston's active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to EAI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future Embodied AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating Embodied AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.</description>

      <title>Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.</description>

      <title>Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In cognitive science, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</description>

      <title>Generation of Asset Administration Shell with Large Language Model Agents: Towards Semantic Interoperability in Digital Twins in the Context of Industry 4.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research introduces a novel approach for achieving semantic interoperability in digital twins and assisting the creation of Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as digital twin model within the context of Industry 4.0. The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications. The prototype implementation and evaluation results are presented on our GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/AASbyLLM.</description>

      <title>Assessing Economic Viability: A Comparative Analysis of Total Cost of Ownership for Domain-Adapted Large Language Models versus State-of-the-art Counterparts in Chip Design Coding Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of total cost of ownership (TCO) and performance between domain-adapted large language models (LLM) and state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs , with a particular emphasis on tasks related to coding assistance for chip design. We examine the TCO and performance metrics of a domain-adaptive LLM, ChipNeMo, against two leading LLMs, Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT-4 Turbo, to assess their efficacy in chip design coding generation. Through a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the model, training methodologies, and operational expenditures, this study aims to provide stakeholders with critical information to select the most economically viable and performance-efficient solutions for their specific needs. Our results underscore the benefits of employing domain-adapted models, such as ChipNeMo, that demonstrate improved performance at significantly reduced costs compared to their general-purpose counterparts. In particular, we reveal the potential of domain-adapted LLMs to decrease TCO by approximately 90%-95%, with the cost advantages becoming increasingly evident as the deployment scale expands. With expansion of deployment, the cost benefits of ChipNeMo become more pronounced, making domain-adaptive LLMs an attractive option for organizations with substantial coding needs supported by LLMs</description>

      <title>X-Light: Cross-City Traffic Signal Control Using Transformer on Transformer as Meta Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effectiveness of traffic light control has been significantly improved by current reinforcement learning-based approaches via better cooperation among multiple traffic lights. However, a persisting issue remains: how to obtain a multi-agent traffic signal control algorithm with remarkable transferability across diverse cities? In this paper, we propose a Transformer on Transformer (TonT) model for cross-city meta multi-agent traffic signal control, named as X-Light: We input the full Markov Decision Process trajectories, and the Lower Transformer aggregates the states, actions, rewards among the target intersection and its neighbors within a city, and the Upper Transformer learns the general decision trajectories across different cities. This dual-level approach bolsters the model's robust generalization and transferability. Notably, when directly transferring to unseen scenarios, ours surpasses all baseline methods with +7.91% on average, and even +16.3% in some cases, yielding the best results.</description>

      <title>ReZero: Boosting MCTS-based Algorithms by Backward-view and Entire-buffer Reanalyze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based algorithms, such as MuZero and its derivatives, have achieved widespread success in various decision-making domains. These algorithms employ the reanalyze process to enhance sample efficiency from stale data, albeit at the expense of significant wall-clock time consumption. To address this issue, we propose a general approach named ReZero to boost tree search operations for MCTS-based algorithms. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the one-armed bandit model, we reanalyze training samples through a backward-view reuse technique which obtains the value estimation of a certain child node in advance. To further adapt to this design, we periodically reanalyze the entire buffer instead of frequently reanalyzing the mini-batch. The synergy of these two designs can significantly reduce the search cost and meanwhile guarantee or even improve performance, simplifying both data collecting and reanalyzing. Experiments conducted on Atari environments and board games demonstrate that ReZero substantially improves training speed while maintaining high sample efficiency. The code is available as part of the LightZero benchmark at https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero.</description>

Abstract: Misdiagnosis is a significant issue in healthcare, leading to harmful consequences for patients. The propagation of mislabeled data through machine learning models into clinical practice is unacceptable. This paper proposes EVINCE, a system designed to 1) improve diagnosis accuracy and 2) rectify misdiagnoses and minimize training data errors. EVINCE stands for Entropy Variation through Information Duality with Equal Competence, leveraging this novel theory to optimize the diagnostic process using multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured debate framework. Our empirical study verifies EVINCE to be effective in achieving its design goals.</description>

      <title>Devil's Advocate: Anticipatory Reflection for LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach that equips LLM agents with introspection, enhancing consistency and adaptability in solving complex tasks. Our approach prompts LLM agents to decompose a given task into manageable subtasks (i.e., to make a plan), and to continuously introspect upon the suitability and results of their actions. We implement a three-fold introspective intervention: 1) anticipatory reflection on potential failures and alternative remedy before action execution, 2) post-action alignment with subtask objectives and backtracking with remedy to ensure utmost effort in plan execution, and 3) comprehensive review upon plan completion for future strategy refinement. By deploying and experimenting with this methodology - a zero-shot approach - within WebArena for practical tasks in web environments, our agent demonstrates superior performance over existing zero-shot methods. The experimental results suggest that our introspection-driven approach not only enhances the agent's ability to navigate unanticipated challenges through a robust mechanism of plan execution, but also improves efficiency by reducing the number of trials and plan revisions needed to achieve a task.</description>

      <title>Meta-Task Planning for Language Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural language models has sparked a new surge of intelligent agent research. Unlike traditional agents, large language model-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success of LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the community. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable action sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for complex tasks at fine granularity, which often requires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging. This paper introduces Meta-Task Planning (MTP), a zero-shot methodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies complex task planning by decomposing it into a hierarchy of subordinate tasks, or meta-tasks. Each meta-task is then mapped into executable actions. MTP was assessed on two rigorous benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank. Notably, MTP achieved an average $\sim40\%$ success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly higher than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline ($2.92\%$), and outperforming $LLM_{api}$-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by $\sim14\%$, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Automatic Jailbreaking of the Text-to-Image Generative AI Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent AI systems have shown extremely powerful performance, even surpassing human performance, on various tasks such as information retrieval, language generation, and image generation based on large language models (LLMs). At the same time, there are diverse safety risks that can cause the generation of malicious contents by circumventing the alignment in LLMs, which are often referred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused on the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the text-to-image (T2I) generation system has been relatively overlooked. In this paper, we first evaluate the safety of the commercial T2I generation systems, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, on copyright infringement with naive prompts. From this empirical study, we find that Copilot and Gemini block only 12% and 17% of the attacks with naive prompts, respectively, while ChatGPT blocks 84% of them. Then, we further propose a stronger automated jailbreaking pipeline for T2I generation systems, which produces prompts that bypass their safety guards. Our automated jailbreaking framework leverages an LLM optimizer to generate prompts to maximize degree of violation from the generated images without any weight updates or gradient computation. Surprisingly, our simple yet effective approach successfully jailbreaks the ChatGPT with 11.0% block rate, making it generate copyrighted contents in 76% of the time. Finally, we explore various defense strategies, such as post-generation filtering and machine unlearning techniques, but found that they were inadequate, which suggests the necessity of stronger defense mechanisms.</description>

      <title>GTA: Generative Trajectory Augmentation with Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) presents challenges of learning effective decision-making policies from static datasets without any online interactions. Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

      <title>Position: Foundation Agents as the Paradigm Shift for Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision making demands intricate interplay between perception, memory, and reasoning to discern optimal policies. Conventional approaches to decision making face challenges related to low sample efficiency and poor generalization. In contrast, foundation models in language and vision have showcased rapid adaptation to diverse new tasks. Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field towards a more comprehensive and impactful future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used in various application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs is urgently needed. This paper presents a novel fingerprinting scheme for the Intellectual Property (IP) protection of image-to-image GANs based on a trusted third party. We break through the stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs. Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically protect the modern image-to-image translation GANs. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform existing strategies.</description>

      <title>ALA: Naturalness-aware Adversarial Lightness Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of DNNs by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized adversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible perturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency property, the adversarial examples can be defended by denoising methods and are hard to realize in the physical world. To avoid the defects, some works have proposed unrestricted attacks to gain better robustness and practicality. It is disappointing that these examples usually look unnatural and can alert the guards. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA), a white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the lightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial to human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with a high attack success rate, we propose unconstrained enhancement in terms of the light and shade relationship in images. To enhance the naturalness of images, we craft the naturalness-aware regularization according to the range and distribution of light. The effectiveness of ALA is verified on two popular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification and Places-365 for scene recognition).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Value-function (VF) approximation is a central problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Classical non-parametric VF estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality. As a result, parsimonious parametric models have been adopted to approximate VFs in high-dimensional spaces, with most efforts being focused on linear and neural-network-based approaches. Differently, this paper puts forth a a parsimonious non-parametric approach, where we use stochastic low-rank algorithms to estimate the VF matrix in an online and model-free fashion. Furthermore, as VFs tend to be multi-dimensional, we propose replacing the classical VF matrix representation with a tensor (multi-way array) representation and, then, use the PARAFAC decomposition to design an online model-free tensor low-rank algorithm. Different versions of the algorithms are proposed, their complexity is analyzed, and their performance is assessed numerically using standardized RL environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The separation of single-channel underwater acoustic signals is a challenging problem with practical significance. Few existing studies focus on the source separation problem with unknown numbers of signals, and how to evaluate the performance of the systems is not yet clear. In this paper, a deep learning-based simultaneous separating solution with a fixed number of output channels equal to the maximum number of possible targets is proposed to address these two problems. This solution avoids the dimensional disaster caused by the permutation problem induced by the alignment of outputs to targets. Specifically, we propose a two-step learning-based separation model with a separator-decoder structure. A performance evaluation method with two quantitative metrics of the separation system for situations with mute channels in the output channels that do not contain target signals is also proposed. Experiments conducted on simulated mixtures of radiated ship noise show that the proposed solution can achieve similar separation performance to that attained with a known number of signals. The proposed separation model with separator-decoder structure achieved competitive performance as two models developed for known numbers of signals, which is highly explainable and extensible and gets the state of the art under this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has applications in a wide range of research fields and applications, including manufacturing and healthcare. The presence of anomalies can indicate novel or unexpected events, such as production faults, system defects, or heart fluttering, and is therefore of particular interest. The large size and complex patterns of time series have led researchers to develop specialised deep learning models for detecting anomalous patterns. This survey focuses on providing structured and comprehensive state-of-the-art time series anomaly detection models through the use of deep learning.

      <title>Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning for Mitigating Biases in Student Predictive Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional methods for student modeling, which involve predicting grades based on measured activities, struggle to provide accurate results for minority/underrepresented student groups due to data availability biases. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Layer Personalized Federated Learning (MLPFL) methodology that optimizes inference accuracy over different layers of student grouping criteria, such as by course and by demographic subgroups within each course. In our approach, personalized models for individual student subgroups are derived from a global model, which is trained in a distributed fashion via meta-gradient updates that account for subgroup heterogeneity while preserving modeling commonalities that exist across the full dataset. The evaluation of the proposed methodology considers case studies of two popular downstream student modeling tasks, knowledge tracing and outcome prediction, which leverage multiple modalities of student behavior (e.g., visits to lecture videos and participation on forums) in model training. Experiments on three real-world online course datasets show significant improvements achieved by our approach over existing student modeling benchmarks, as evidenced by an increased average prediction quality and decreased variance across different student subgroups. Visual analysis of the resulting students' knowledge state embeddings confirm that our personalization methodology extracts activity patterns clustered into different student subgroups, consistent with the performance enhancements we obtain over the baselines.</description>

      <title>CHGNN: A Semi-Supervised Contrastive Hypergraph Learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs can model higher-order relationships among data objects that are found in applications such as social networks and bioinformatics. However, recent studies on hypergraph learning that extend graph convolutional networks to hypergraphs cannot learn effectively from features of unlabeled data. To such learning, we propose a contrastive hypergraph neural network, CHGNN, that exploits self-supervised contrastive learning techniques to learn from labeled and unlabeled data. First, CHGNN includes an adaptive hypergraph view generator that adopts an auto-augmentation strategy and learns a perturbed probability distribution of minimal sufficient views. Second, CHGNN encompasses an improved hypergraph encoder that considers hyperedge homogeneity to fuse information effectively. Third, CHGNN is equipped with a joint loss function that combines a similarity loss for the view generator, a node classification loss, and a hyperedge homogeneity loss to inject supervision signals. It also includes basic and cross-validation contrastive losses, associated with an enhanced contrastive loss training process. Experimental results on nine real datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of CHGNN, showing that it outperforms 13 competitors in terms of classification accuracy consistently.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of LLM-generated Texts with a Bayesian Surrogate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of machine-generated text, especially from large language models (LLMs), is crucial in preventing serious social problems resulting from their misuse. Some methods train dedicated detectors on specific datasets but fall short in generalizing to unseen test data, while other zero-shot ones often yield suboptimal performance. Although the recent DetectGPT has shown promising detection performance, it suffers from significant inefficiency issues, as detecting a single candidate requires querying the source LLM with hundreds of its perturbations. This paper aims to bridge this gap. Concretely, we propose to incorporate a Bayesian surrogate model, which allows us to select typical samples based on Bayesian uncertainty and interpolate scores from typical samples to other samples, to improve query efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches under a low query budget. Notably, when detecting the text generated by LLaMA family models, our method with just 2 or 3 queries can outperform DetectGPT with 200 queries.</description>

      <title>The future of human-centric eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is not post-hoc explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enabling human understanding and trust in deep learning systems. As models get larger, more ubiquitous, and pervasive in aspects of daily life, explainability is necessary to minimize adverse effects of model mistakes. Unfortunately, current approaches in human-centric XAI (e.g. predictive tasks in healthcare, education, or personalized ads) tend to rely on a single post-hoc explainer, whereas recent work has identified systematic disagreement between post-hoc explainers when applied to the same instances of underlying black-box models. In this paper, we therefore present a call for action to address the limitations of current state-of-the-art explainers. We propose a shift from post-hoc explainability to designing interpretable neural network architectures. We identify five needs of human-centric XAI (real-time, accurate, actionable, human-interpretable, and consistent) and propose two schemes for interpretable-by-design neural network workflows (adaptive routing with InterpretCC and temporal diagnostics with I2MD). We postulate that the future of human-centric XAI is neither in explaining black-boxes nor in reverting to traditional, interpretable models, but in neural networks that are intrinsically interpretable.</description>

      <title>LongDocFACTScore: Evaluating the Factuality of Long Document Abstractive Summarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining factual consistency is a critical issue in abstractive text summarisation, however, it cannot be assessed by traditional automatic metrics used for evaluating text summarisation, such as ROUGE scoring. Recent efforts have been devoted to developing improved metrics for measuring factual consistency using pre-trained language models, but these metrics have restrictive token limits, and are therefore not suitable for evaluating long document text summarisation. Moreover, there is limited research and resources available for evaluating whether existing automatic evaluation metrics are fit for purpose when applied in long document settings. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of automatic metrics for assessing the factual consistency of long document text summarisation. We create a human-annotated data set for evaluating automatic factuality metrics, LongSciVerify, which contains fine-grained factual consistency annotations for long document summaries from the scientific domain. We also propose a new evaluation framework, LongDocFACTScore, which is suitable for evaluating long document summarisation. This framework allows metrics to be efficiently extended to any length document and outperforms existing state-of-the-art metrics in its ability to correlate with human measures of factuality when used to evaluate long document summarisation data sets. We make our code and LongSciVerify data set publicly available: https://github.com/jbshp/LongDocFACTScore.</description>

      <title>2-Cats: 2D Copula Approximating Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16391v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copulas are powerful statistical tools for capturing dependencies across data dimensions. Applying Copulas involves estimating independent marginals, a straightforward task, followed by the much more challenging task of determining a single copulating function, $C$, that links these marginals. For bivariate data, a copula takes the form of a two-increasing function $C: (u,v)\in \mathbb{I}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{I}$, where $\mathbb{I} = [0, 1]$. This paper proposes 2-Cats, a Neural Network (NN) model that learns two-dimensional Copulas without relying on specific Copula families (e.g., Archimedean). Furthermore, via both theoretical properties of the model and a Lagrangian training approach, we show that 2-Cats meets the desiderata of Copula properties. Moreover, inspired by the literature on Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Sobolev Training, we further extend our training strategy to learn not only the output of a Copula but also its derivatives. Our proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art across various datasets while respecting (provably for most and approximately for a single other) properties of C.</description>

      <title>Memory in Plain Sight: Surveying the Uncanny Resemblances of Associative Memories and Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generative process of Diffusion Models (DMs) has recently set state-of-the-art on many AI generation benchmarks. Though the generative process is traditionally understood as an "iterative denoiser", there is no universally accepted language to describe it. We introduce a novel perspective to describe DMs using the mathematical language of memory retrieval from the field of energy-based Associative Memories (AMs), making efforts to keep our presentation approachable to newcomers to both of these fields. Unifying these two fields provides insight that DMs can be seen as a particular kind of AM where Lyapunov stability guarantees are bypassed by intelligently engineering the dynamics (i.e., the noise and step size schedules) of the denoising process. Finally, we present a growing body of evidence that records DMs exhibiting empirical behavior we would expect from AMs, and conclude by discussing research opportunities that are revealed by understanding DMs as a form of energy-based memory.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficiency in Multi-Batch Reinforcement Learning: The Need for Dimension-Dependent Adaptivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the relationship between sample-efficiency and adaptivity in reinforcement learning. An algorithm is sample-efficient if it uses a number of queries $n$ to the environment that is polynomial in the dimension $d$ of the problem. Adaptivity refers to the frequency at which queries are sent and feedback is processed to update the querying strategy. To investigate this interplay, we employ a learning framework that allows sending queries in $K$ batches, with feedback being processed and queries updated after each batch. This model encompasses the whole adaptivity spectrum, ranging from non-adaptive 'offline' ($K=1$) to fully adaptive ($K=n$) scenarios, and regimes in between. For the problems of policy evaluation and best-policy identification under $d$-dimensional linear function approximation, we establish $\Omega(\log \log d)$ lower bounds on the number of batches $K$ required for sample-efficient algorithms with $n = O(poly(d))$ queries. Our results show that just having adaptivity ($K&gt;1$) does not necessarily guarantee sample-efficiency. Notably, the adaptivity-boundary for sample-efficiency is not between offline reinforcement learning ($K=1$), where sample-efficiency was known to not be possible, and adaptive settings. Instead, the boundary lies between different regimes of adaptivity and depends on the problem dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rise in popularity, it is necessary to assess their capability in critically relevant domains. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework, grounded in science communication research, to assess LLM responses to questions about climate change. Our framework emphasizes both presentational and epistemological adequacy, offering a fine-grained analysis of LLM generations spanning 8 dimensions and 30 issues. Our evaluation task is a real-world example of a growing number of challenging problems where AI can complement and lift human performance. We introduce a novel protocol for scalable oversight that relies on AI Assistance and raters with relevant education. We evaluate several recent LLMs on a set of diverse climate questions. Our results point to a significant gap between surface and epistemological qualities of LLMs in the realm of climate communication.</description>

      <title>Beyond Random Augmentations: Pretraining with Hard Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03940v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim for model invariance to different image augmentations known as views. To achieve this invariance, conventional approaches make use of random sampling operations within the image augmentation pipeline. We hypothesize that the efficacy of pretraining pipelines based on conventional random view sampling can be enhanced by explicitly selecting views that benefit the learning progress. A simple, yet effective approach is to select hard views that yield a higher loss. In this paper, we present Hard View Pretraining (HVP), a learning-free strategy that builds upon this hypothesis and extends random view generation. HVP exposes the model to harder, more challenging samples during SSL pretraining, which enhances downstream performance. It encompasses the following iterative steps: 1) randomly sample multiple views and forward each view through the pretrained model, 2) create pairs of two views and compute their loss, 3) adversarially select the pair yielding the highest loss depending on the current model state, and 4) run the backward pass with the selected pair. As a result, HVP achieves linear evaluation accuracy improvements of 1% on average on ImageNet for both 100 and 300 epoch pretraining and similar improvements on transfer tasks across DINO, SimSiam, iBOT, and SimCLR.</description>

      <title>Mastering Robot Manipulation with Multimodal Prompts through Pretraining and Multi-task Fine-tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt-based learning has been demonstrated as a compelling paradigm contributing to large language models' tremendous success (LLMs). Inspired by their success in language tasks, existing research has leveraged LLMs in embodied instruction following and task planning. In this work, we tackle the problem of training a robot to understand multimodal prompts, interleaving vision signals with text descriptions. This type of task poses a major challenge to robots' capability to understand the interconnection and complementarity between vision and language signals. In this work, we introduce an effective framework that learns a policy to perform robot manipulation with multimodal prompts from multi-task expert trajectories. Our methods consist of a two-stage training pipeline that performs inverse dynamics pretraining and multi-task finetuning. To facilitate multimodal understanding, we design our multimodal prompt encoder by augmenting a pretrained LM with a residual connection to the visual input and model the dependencies among action dimensions. Empirically, we evaluate the efficacy of our method on the VIMA-BENCH and establish a new state-of-the-art (10% improvement in success rate). Moreover, we demonstrate that our model exhibits remarkable in-context learning ability. Project page: \url{https://midas-icml.github.io/}.</description>

      <title>Optimized Layerwise Approximation for Efficient Private Inference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have explored the deployment of privacy-preserving deep neural networks utilizing homomorphic encryption (HE), especially for private inference (PI). Many works have attempted the approximation-aware training (AAT) approach in PI, changing the activation functions of a model to low-degree polynomials that are easier to compute on HE by allowing model retraining. However, due to constraints in the training environment, it is often necessary to consider post-training approximation (PTA), using the pre-trained parameters of the existing plaintext model without retraining. Existing PTA studies have uniformly approximated the activation function in all layers to a high degree to mitigate accuracy loss from approximation, leading to significant time consumption. This study proposes an optimized layerwise approximation (OLA), a systematic framework that optimizes both accuracy loss and time consumption by using different approximation polynomials for each layer in the PTA scenario. For efficient approximation, we reflect the layerwise impact on the classification accuracy by considering the actual input distribution of each activation function while constructing the optimization problem. Additionally, we provide a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem and achieve the optimized layerwise degrees in polynomial time. As a result, the OLA method reduces inference times for the ResNet-20 model and the ResNet-32 model by 3.02 times and 2.82 times, respectively, compared to prior state-of-the-art implementations employing uniform degree polynomials. Furthermore, we successfully classified CIFAR-10 by replacing the GELU function in the ConvNeXt model with only 3-degree polynomials using the proposed method, without modifying the backbone model.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the potential of prompt engineering: a comprehensive review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This comprehensive review explores the transformative potential of prompt engineering within the realm of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal language models (MMLMs). The development of AI, from its inception in the 1950s to the emergence of neural networks and deep learning architectures, has culminated in sophisticated LLMs like GPT-4 and BERT, as well as MMLMs like DALL-E and CLIP. These models have revolutionized tasks in diverse fields such as workplace automation, healthcare, and education. Prompt engineering emerges as a crucial technique to maximize the utility and accuracy of these models. This paper delves into both foundational and advanced methodologies of prompt engineering, including techniques like Chain of Thought, Self-consistency, and Generated Knowledge, which significantly enhance model performance. Additionally, it examines the integration of multimodal data through innovative approaches such as Multi-modal Prompt Learning (MaPLe), Conditional Prompt Learning, and Context Optimization. Critical to this discussion is the aspect of AI security, particularly adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in prompt engineering. Strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance model robustness are thoroughly reviewed. The evaluation of prompt methods is addressed through both subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. This review underscores the pivotal role of prompt engineering in advancing AI capabilities, providing a structured framework for future research and application.</description>

      <title>Improving Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Q Conditioned State Entropy Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19805v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying how to fine-tune offline reinforcement learning (RL) pre-trained policy is profoundly significant for enhancing the sample efficiency of RL algorithms. However, directly fine-tuning pre-trained policies often results in sub-optimal performance. This is primarily due to the distribution shift between offline pre-training and online fine-tuning stages. Specifically, the distribution shift limits the acquisition of effective online samples, ultimately impacting the online fine-tuning performance. In order to narrow down the distribution shift between offline and online stages, we proposed Q conditioned state entropy (QCSE) as intrinsic reward. Specifically, QCSE maximizes the state entropy of all samples individually, considering their respective Q values. This approach encourages exploration of low-frequency samples while penalizing high-frequency ones, and implicitly achieves State Marginal Matching (SMM), thereby ensuring optimal performance, solving the asymptotic sub-optimality of constraint-based approaches. Additionally, QCSE can seamlessly integrate into various RL algorithms, enhancing online fine-tuning performance. To validate our claim, we conduct extensive experiments, and observe significant improvements with QCSE (about 13% for CQL and 8% for Cal-QL). Furthermore, we extended experimental tests to other algorithms, affirming the generality of QCSE.</description>

Abstract: Citation count of a paper is a commonly used proxy for evaluating the significance of a paper in the scientific community. Yet citation measures are widely criticized for failing to accurately reflect the true impact of a paper. Thus, we propose CausalCite, a new way to measure the significance of a paper by assessing the causal impact of the paper on its follow-up papers. CausalCite is based on a novel causal inference method, TextMatch, which adapts the traditional matching framework to high-dimensional text embeddings. TextMatch encodes each paper using text embeddings from large language models (LLMs), extracts similar samples by cosine similarity, and synthesizes a counterfactual sample as the weighted average of similar papers according to their similarity values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CausalCite on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, (test-of-time) awards for past papers, and its stability across various subfields of AI. We also provide a set of findings that can serve as suggested ways for future researchers to use our metric for a better understanding of the quality of a paper.

      <title>Controllable Text Summarization: Unraveling Challenges, Approaches, and Prospects -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic text summarization approaches often fail to address the specific intent and needs of individual users. Recently, scholarly attention has turned to the development of summarization methods that are more closely tailored and controlled to align with specific objectives and user needs. Despite a growing corpus of controllable summarization research, there is no comprehensive survey available that thoroughly explores the diverse controllable attributes employed in this context, delves into the associated challenges, and investigates the existing solutions. In this survey, we formalize the Controllable Text Summarization (CTS) task, categorize controllable attributes according to their shared characteristics and objectives, and present a thorough examination of existing datasets and methods within each category. Moreover, based on our findings, we uncover limitations and research gaps, while also exploring potential solutions and future directions for CTS. We release our detailed analysis of CTS papers at https://github.com/ashokurlana/controllable_text_summarization_survey.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Optimization with Policy Adaptation using Latent Space Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization underpins many real-world applications and yet, designing performant algorithms to solve these complex, typically NP-hard, problems remains a significant research challenge. Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a versatile framework for designing heuristics across a broad spectrum of problem domains. However, despite notable progress, RL has not yet supplanted industrial solvers as the go-to solution. Current approaches emphasize pre-training heuristics that construct solutions but often rely on search procedures with limited variance, such as stochastically sampling numerous solutions from a single policy or employing computationally expensive fine-tuning of the policy on individual problem instances. Building on the intuition that performant search at inference time should be anticipated during pre-training, we propose COMPASS, a novel RL approach that parameterizes a distribution of diverse and specialized policies conditioned on a continuous latent space. We evaluate COMPASS across three canonical problems - Travelling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing, and Job-Shop Scheduling - and demonstrate that our search strategy (i) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on 11 standard benchmarking tasks and (ii) generalizes better, surpassing all other approaches on a set of 18 procedurally transformed instance distributions.</description>

      <title>Vamos: Versatile Action Models for Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What makes good representations for video understanding, such as anticipating future activities, or answering video-conditioned questions? While earlier approaches focus on end-to-end learning directly from video pixels, we propose to revisit text-based representations, such as general-purpose video captions, which are interpretable and can be directly consumed by large language models (LLMs). Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularity. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the ``reasoner'', and can flexibly leverage visual embedding and free-form text descriptions as its input. To interpret the important text evidence for question answering, we generalize the concept bottleneck model to work with tokens and nonlinear models, which uses hard attention to select a small subset of tokens from the free-form text as inputs to the LLM reasoner. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, NeXT-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era. We also demonstrate that our token bottleneck model is able to select relevant evidence from free-form text, support test-time intervention, and achieves nearly 5 times inference speedup while keeping a competitive question answering performance. Code and models are publicly released at https://brown-palm.github.io/Vamos/.</description>

      <title>SAMSGL: Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting in various domains, like traffic prediction and weather forecasting, is a challenging endeavor, primarily due to the difficulties in modeling propagation dynamics and capturing high-dimensional interactions among nodes. Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</description>

      <title>KOALA: Empirical Lessons Toward Memory-Efficient and Fast Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As text-to-image (T2I) synthesis models increase in size, they demand higher inference costs due to the need for more expensive GPUs with larger memory, which makes it challenging to reproduce these models in addition to the restricted access to training datasets. Our study aims to reduce these inference costs and explores how far the generative capabilities of T2I models can be extended using only publicly available datasets and open-source models. To this end, by using the de facto standard text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), we present three key practices in building an efficient T2I model: (1) Knowledge distillation: we explore how to effectively distill the generation capability of SDXL into an efficient U-Net and find that self-attention is the most crucial part. (2) Data: despite fewer samples, high-resolution images with rich captions are more crucial than a larger number of low-resolution images with short captions. (3) Teacher: Step-distilled Teacher allows T2I models to reduce the noising steps. Based on these findings, we build two types of efficient text-to-image models, called KOALA-Turbo &amp;-Lightning, with two compact U-Nets (1B &amp; 700M), reducing the model size up to 54% and 69% of the SDXL U-Net. In particular, the KOALA-Lightning-700M is 4x faster than SDXL while still maintaining satisfactory generation quality. Moreover, unlike SDXL, our KOALA models can generate 1024px high-resolution images on consumer-grade GPUs with 8GB of VRAMs (3060Ti). We believe that our KOALA models will have a significant practical impact, serving as cost-effective alternatives to SDXL for academic researchers and general users in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutions Enrich the Self-Attention in Transformers!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers, renowned for their self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, time-series modeling, etc. However, one of the challenges with deep Transformer models is the oversmoothing problem, where representations across layers converge to indistinguishable values, leading to significant performance degradation. We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph regression, speech recognition, and code classification.</description>

      <title>Empowering Working Memory for Large Language Model Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive linguistic capabilities. However, a key limitation persists in their lack of human-like memory faculties. LLMs exhibit constrained memory retention across sequential interactions, hindering complex reasoning. This paper explores the potential of applying cognitive psychology's working memory frameworks, to enhance LLM architecture. The limitations of traditional LLM memory designs are analyzed, including their isolation of distinct dialog episodes and lack of persistent memory links. To address this, an innovative model is proposed incorporating a centralized Working Memory Hub and Episodic Buffer access to retain memories across episodes. This architecture aims to provide greater continuity for nuanced contextual reasoning during intricate tasks and collaborative scenarios. While promising, further research is required into optimizing episodic memory encoding, storage, prioritization, retrieval, and security. Overall, this paper provides a strategic blueprint for developing LLM agents with more sophisticated, human-like memory capabilities, highlighting memory mechanisms as a vital frontier in artificial general intelligence.</description>

      <title>SERNet-Former: Semantic Segmentation by Efficient Residual Network with Attention-Boosting Gates and Attention-Fusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation requires overcoming the increasing computational cost as well as issues such as fusing semantic information from global and local contexts. Based on the recent success and problems that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounter in semantic segmentation, this research proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a unique efficient residual network, Efficient-ResNet. Attention-boosting gates (AbGs) and attention-boosting modules (AbMs) are deployed by aiming to fuse the equivariant and feature-based semantic information with the equivalent sizes of the output of global context of the efficient residual network in the encoder. Respectively, the decoder network is developed with the additional attention-fusion networks (AfNs) inspired by AbM. AfNs are designed to improve the efficiency in the one-to-one conversion of the semantic information by deploying additional convolution layers in the decoder part. Our network is tested on the challenging CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, and the proposed methods reveal significant improvements on the residual networks. To the best of our knowledge, the developed network, SERNet-Former, achieves state-of-the-art results (84.62 % mean IoU) on CamVid dataset and challenging results (87.35 % mean IoU) on Cityscapes validation dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data, prevalent in domains ranging from social networks to biochemical analysis, serve as the foundation for diverse real-world systems. While graph neural networks demonstrate proficiency in modeling this type of data, their success is often reliant on significant amounts of labeled data, posing a challenge in practical scenarios with limited annotation resources. To tackle this problem, tremendous efforts have been devoted to enhancing graph machine learning performance under low-resource settings by exploring various approaches to minimal supervision. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept of Data-Efficient Graph Learning (DEGL) as a research frontier, and present the first survey that summarizes the current progress of DEGL. We initiate by highlighting the challenges inherent in training models with large labeled data, paving the way for our exploration into DEGL. Next, we systematically review recent advances on this topic from several key aspects, including self-supervised graph learning, semi-supervised graph learning, and few-shot graph learning. Also, we state promising directions for future research, contributing to the evolution of graph machine learning.</description>

      <title>Self-Attention through Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it. Experiments verify our excellent performances and efficiency on in-distribution, distribution-shift and out-of-distribution benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Internet of Things Implementation Barriers in the Cold Supply Chain: An Integrated ISM-MICMAC and DEMATEL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology inside the cold supply chain can enhance transparency, efficiency, and quality, optimizing operating procedures and increasing productivity. The integration of IoT in this complicated setting is hindered by specific barriers that need a thorough examination. Prominent barriers to IoT implementation in the cold supply chain are identified using a two-stage model. After reviewing the available literature on the topic of IoT implementation, a total of 13 barriers were found. The survey data was cross-validated for quality, and Cronbach's alpha test was employed to ensure validity. This research applies the interpretative structural modeling technique in the first phase to identify the main barriers. Among those barriers, "regularity compliance" and "cold chain networks" are key drivers for IoT adoption strategies. MICMAC's driving and dependence power element categorization helps evaluate the barrier interactions. In the second phase of this research, a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory methodology was employed to identify causal relationships between barriers and evaluate them according to their relative importance. Each cause is a potential drive, and if its efficiency can be enhanced, the system as a whole benefits. The research findings provide industry stakeholders, governments, and organizations with significant drivers of IoT adoption to overcome these barriers and optimize the utilization of IoT technology to improve the effectiveness and reliability of the cold supply chain.</description>

      <title>Human-like Category Learning by Injecting Ecological Priors from Large Language Models into Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecological rationality refers to the notion that humans are rational agents adapted to their environment. However, testing this theory remains challenging due to two reasons: the difficulty in defining what tasks are ecologically valid and building rational models for these tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that large language models can generate cognitive tasks, specifically category learning tasks, that match the statistics of real-world tasks, thereby addressing the first challenge. We tackle the second challenge by deriving rational agents adapted to these tasks using the framework of meta-learning, leading to a class of models called ecologically rational meta-learned inference (ERMI). ERMI quantitatively explains human data better than seven other cognitive models in two different experiments. It additionally matches human behavior on a qualitative level: (1) it finds the same tasks difficult that humans find difficult, (2) it becomes more reliant on an exemplar-based strategy for assigning categories with learning, and (3) it generalizes to unseen stimuli in a human-like way. Furthermore, we show that ERMI's ecologically valid priors allow it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Learning from Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly supervised learning generally faces challenges in applicability to various scenarios with diverse weak supervision and in scalability due to the complexity of existing algorithms, thereby hindering the practical deployment. This paper introduces a general framework for learning from weak supervision (GLWS) with a novel algorithm. Central to GLWS is an Expectation-Maximization (EM) formulation, adeptly accommodating various weak supervision sources, including instance partial labels, aggregate statistics, pairwise observations, and unlabeled data. We further present an advanced algorithm that significantly simplifies the EM computational demands using a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) along with a forward-backward algorithm, which effectively reduces time complexity from quadratic or factorial often required in existing solutions to linear scale. The problem of learning from arbitrary weak supervision is therefore converted to the NFA modeling of them. GLWS not only enhances the scalability of machine learning models but also demonstrates superior performance and versatility across 11 weak supervision scenarios. We hope our work paves the way for further advancements and practical deployment in this field.</description>

      <title>Selecting Large Language Model to Fine-tune via Rectified Scaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing ecosystem of LLMs has posed a challenge in selecting the most appropriate pre-trained model to fine-tune amidst a sea of options. Given constrained resources, fine-tuning all models and making selections afterward is unrealistic. In this work, we formulate this resource-constrained selection task into predicting fine-tuning performance and illustrate its natural connection with Scaling Law. Unlike pre-training, we find that the fine-tuning scaling curve includes not just the well-known "power phase" but also the previously unobserved "pre-power phase". We also explain why existing Scaling Law fails to capture this phase transition phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. To address this, we introduce the concept of "pre-learned data size" into our Rectified Scaling Law, which overcomes theoretical limitations and fits experimental results much better. By leveraging our law, we propose a novel LLM selection algorithm that selects the near-optimal model with hundreds of times less resource consumption, while other methods may provide negatively correlated selection. The project page is available at rectified-scaling-law.github.io.</description>

      <title>MetaOptimize: A Framework for Optimizing Step Sizes and Other Meta-parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02342v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing meta-parameters (i.e., hyperparameters) in machine learning algorithms, a critical factor influencing training efficiency and model performance. Moving away from the computationally expensive traditional meta-parameter search methods, we introduce MetaOptimize framework that dynamically adjusts meta-parameters, particularly step sizes (also known as learning rates), during training. More specifically, MetaOptimize can wrap around any first-order optimization algorithm, tuning step sizes on the fly to minimize a specific form of regret that accounts for long-term effect of step sizes on training, through a discounted sum of future losses. We also introduce low complexity variants of MetaOptimize that, in conjunction with its adaptability to multiple optimization algorithms, demonstrate performance competitive to those of best hand-crafted learning rate schedules across various machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Representation Surgery for Multi-Task Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) compresses the information from multiple tasks into a unified backbone to improve computational efficiency and generalization. Recent work directly merges multiple independently trained models to perform MTL instead of collecting their raw data for joint training, greatly expanding the application scenarios of MTL. However, by visualizing the representation distribution of existing model merging schemes, we find that the merged model often suffers from the dilemma of representation bias. That is, there is a significant discrepancy in the representation distribution between the merged and individual models, resulting in poor performance of merged MTL. In this paper, we propose a representation surgery solution called "Surgery" to reduce representation bias in the merged model. Specifically, Surgery is a lightweight task-specific module that takes the representation of the merged model as input and attempts to output the biases contained in the representation from the merged model. We then designed an unsupervised optimization objective that updates the Surgery module by minimizing the distance between the merged model's representation and the individual model's representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant MTL performance improvements when our Surgery module is applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging schemes.</description>

      <title>ToonAging: Face Re-Aging upon Artistic Portrait Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face re-aging is a prominent field in computer vision and graphics, with significant applications in photorealistic domains such as movies, advertising, and live streaming. Recently, the need to apply face re-aging to non-photorealistic images, like comics, illustrations, and animations, has emerged as an extension in various entertainment sectors. However, the lack of a network that can seamlessly edit the apparent age in NPR images has limited these tasks to a naive, sequential approach. This often results in unpleasant artifacts and a loss of facial attributes due to domain discrepancies. In this paper, we introduce a novel one-stage method for face re-aging combined with portrait style transfer, executed in a single generative step. We leverage existing face re-aging and style transfer networks, both trained within the same PR domain. Our method uniquely fuses distinct latent vectors, each responsible for managing aging-related attributes and NPR appearance. By adopting an exemplar-based approach, our method offers greater flexibility compared to domain-level fine-tuning approaches, which typically require separate training or fine-tuning for each domain. This effectively addresses the limitation of requiring paired datasets for re-aging and domain-level, data-driven approaches for stylization. Our experiments show that our model can effortlessly generate re-aged images while simultaneously transferring the style of examples, maintaining both natural appearance and controllability.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Cross-Task Linearity in the Pretraining-Finetuning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has become the prevailing trend in modern deep learning. In this work, we discover an intriguing linear phenomenon in models that are initialized from a common pretrained checkpoint and finetuned on different tasks, termed as Cross-Task Linearity (CTL). Specifically, we show that if we linearly interpolate the weights of two finetuned models, the features in the weight-interpolated model are often approximately equal to the linear interpolation of features in two finetuned models at each layer. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence supporting that CTL consistently occurs for finetuned models that start from the same pretrained checkpoint. We conjecture that in the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, neural networks approximately function as linear maps, mapping from the parameter space to the feature space. Based on this viewpoint, our study unveils novel insights into explaining model merging/editing, particularly by translating operations from the parameter space to the feature space. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the root cause for the emergence of CTL, highlighting the role of pretraining.</description>

      <title>Are Machines Better at Complex Reasoning? Unveiling Human-Machine Inference Gaps in Entailment Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Making inferences in text comprehension to understand the meaning is essential in language processing. This work studies the entailment verification (EV) problem of multi-sentence premises that requires a system to make multiple inferences implicitly. Studying EV for such complex premises is important because modern NLP problems, such as detecting inconsistent model-generated rationales, require complex multi-hop reasoning. However, current textual inference datasets mostly contain short premises that only partially focus on these challenges. To address this, we compile an EV benchmark that includes datasets from three NLP domains (NLI, contextual QA, and rationales) containing multi-sentence premises. On benchmarking humans and LLMs, we find that LLMs are better than humans in multi-hop reasoning across extended contexts, while humans perform better in simple deductive reasoning tasks. We also finetune a Flan-T5 model for EV using two training objectives to obtain a strong open-source model that outperforms GPT-3.5 and rivals GPT-4. Finally, we use this model to filter out inconsistent model-generated rationales in self-consistency decoding, resulting in a 6% accuracy improvement on average across three MCQ datasets.</description>

      <title>InfLLM: Training-Free Long-Context Extrapolation for LLMs with an Efficient Context Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone in real-world applications with lengthy streaming inputs (e.g., LLM-driven agents). However, existing LLMs, pre-trained on sequences with a restricted maximum length, cannot process longer sequences due to the out-of-domain and distraction issues. Common solutions often involve continual pre-training on longer sequences, which will introduce expensive computational overhead and uncontrollable change in model capabilities. In this paper, we unveil the intrinsic capacity of LLMs for understanding extremely long sequences without any fine-tuning. To this end, we introduce a training-free memory-based method, InfLLM. Specifically, InfLLM stores distant contexts into additional memory units and employs an efficient mechanism to lookup token-relevant units for attention computation. Thereby, InfLLM allows LLMs to efficiently process long sequences with a limited context window and well capture long-distance dependencies. Without any training, InfLLM enables LLMs that are pre-trained on sequences consisting of a few thousand tokens to achieve comparable performance with competitive baselines that continually train these LLMs on long sequences. Even when the sequence length is scaled to $1,024$K, InfLLM still effectively captures long-distance dependencies. Our code can be found in \url{https://github.com/thunlp/InfLLM}.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look at the Limitations of Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction Tuning (IT), the process of training large language models (LLMs) using instruction-response pairs, has emerged as the predominant method for transforming base pre-trained LLMs into open-domain conversational agents. While IT has achieved notable success and widespread adoption, its limitations and shortcomings remain underexplored. In this paper, through rigorous experiments and an in-depth analysis of the changes LLMs undergo through IT, we reveal various limitations of IT. In particular, we show that (1) IT fails to enhance knowledge or skills in LLMs. LoRA fine-tuning is limited to learning response initiation and style tokens, and full-parameter fine-tuning leads to knowledge degradation. (2) Copying response patterns from IT datasets derived from knowledgeable sources leads to a decline in response quality. (3) Full-parameter fine-tuning increases hallucination by inaccurately borrowing tokens from conceptually similar instances in the IT dataset for generating responses. (4) Popular methods to improve IT do not lead to performance improvements over a simple LoRA fine-tuned model. Our findings reveal that responses generated solely from pre-trained knowledge consistently outperform responses by models that learn any form of new knowledge from IT on open-source datasets. We hope the insights and challenges revealed in this paper inspire future work in related directions.</description>

      <title>Improving Token-Based World Models with Parallel Observation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05643v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward mode tailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12 hours. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/leor-c/REM}.</description>

      <title>The last Dance : Robust backdoor attack via diffusion models and bayesian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05967v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music generation models have opened new avenues in musical creativity. However, music generation usually involves iterative refinements, and how to edit the generated music remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach to the editing of music generated by such models, enabling the modification of specific attributes, such as genre, mood and instrument, while maintaining other aspects unchanged. Our method transforms text editing to \textit{latent space manipulation} while adding an extra constraint to enforce consistency. It seamlessly integrates with existing pretrained text-to-music diffusion models without requiring additional training. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over both zero-shot and certain supervised baselines in style and timbre transfer evaluations. Additionally, we showcase the practical applicability of our approach in real-world music editing scenarios.</description>

      <title>THE COLOSSEUM: A Benchmark for Evaluating Generalization for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To realize effective large-scale, real-world robotic applications, we must evaluate how well our robot policies adapt to changes in environmental conditions. Unfortunately, a majority of studies evaluate robot performance in environments closely resembling or even identical to the training setup. We present THE COLOSSEUM, a novel simulation benchmark, with 20 diverse manipulation tasks, that enables systematical evaluation of models across 14 axes of environmental perturbations. These perturbations include changes in color, texture, and size of objects, table-tops, and backgrounds; we also vary lighting, distractors, physical properties perturbations and camera pose. Using THE COLOSSEUM, we compare 5 state-of-the-art manipulation models to reveal that their success rate degrades between 30-50% across these perturbation factors. When multiple perturbations are applied in unison, the success rate degrades $\geq$75%. We identify that changing the number of distractor objects, target object color, or lighting conditions are the perturbations that reduce model performance the most. To verify the ecological validity of our results, we show that our results in simulation are correlated ($\bar{R}^2 = 0.614$) to similar perturbations in real-world experiments. We open source code for others to use THE COLOSSEUM, and also release code to 3D print the objects used to replicate the real-world perturbations. Ultimately, we hope that THE COLOSSEUM will serve as a benchmark to identify modeling decisions that systematically improve generalization for manipulation.

      <title>BBox-Adapter: Lightweight Adapting for Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adapting state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini for specific tasks is challenging. Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter's effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively.</description>

      <title>Relative Preference Optimization: Enhancing LLM Alignment through Contrasting Responses across Identical and Diverse Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of large language models (LLMs), aligning models with the diverse preferences of users is a critical challenge. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has played a key role in this area. It works by using pairs of preferences derived from the same prompts, and it functions without needing an additional reward model. However, DPO does not fully reflect the complex nature of human learning, which often involves understanding contrasting responses to not only identical but also similar questions. To overcome this shortfall, we propose Relative Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO is designed to discern between more and less preferred responses derived from both identical and related prompts. It introduces a contrastive weighting mechanism, enabling the tuning of LLMs using a broader range of preference data, including both paired and unpaired sets. This approach expands the learning capabilities of the model, allowing it to leverage insights from a more varied set of prompts. Through empirical tests, including dialogue and summarization tasks, and evaluations using the AlpacaEval2.0 leaderboard, RPO has demonstrated a superior ability to align LLMs with user preferences and to improve their adaptability during the training process.

      <title>In-Context Learning with Transformers: Softmax Attention Adapts to Function Lipschitzness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A striking property of transformers is their ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), a machine learning framework in which the learner is presented with a novel context during inference implicitly through some data, and tasked with making a prediction in that context. As such, that learner must adapt to the context without additional training. We explore the role of softmax attention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task. We show that an attention unit learns a window that it uses to implement a nearest-neighbors predictor adapted to the landscape of the pretraining tasks. Specifically, we show that this window widens with decreasing Lipschitzness and increasing label noise in the pretraining tasks. We also show that on low-rank, linear problems, the attention unit learns to project onto the appropriate subspace before inference. Further, we show that this adaptivity relies crucially on the softmax activation and thus cannot be replicated by the linear activation often studied in prior theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>ED-Copilot: Reduce Emergency Department Wait Time with Language Model Diagnostic Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the emergency department (ED), patients undergo triage and multiple laboratory tests before diagnosis. This time-consuming process causes ED crowding which impacts patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time) cost-effective diagnostic assistance that leverages artificial intelligence systems to help ED clinicians make efficient and accurate diagnoses. In collaboration with ED clinicians, we use public patient data to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark for AI systems to suggest laboratory tests that minimize wait time while accurately predicting critical outcomes such as death. With MIMIC-ED-Assist, we develop ED-Copilot which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic predictions. ED-Copilot employs a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode patient information and uses reinforcement learning to minimize ED wait time and maximize prediction accuracy. On MIMIC-ED-Assist, ED-Copilot improves prediction accuracy over baselines while halving average wait time from four hours to two hours. ED-Copilot can also effectively personalize treatment recommendations based on patient severity, further highlighting its potential as a diagnostic assistant. Since MIMIC-ED-Assist is a retrospective benchmark, ED-Copilot is restricted to recommend only observed tests. We show ED-Copilot achieves competitive performance without this restriction as the maximum allowed time increases. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ED-Copilot.</description>

      <title>CriticBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Critique-Correct Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14809</link>

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement. This paper introduces CriticBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks. CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning. Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique. We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Information Structure in Reinforcement Learning for Partially-Observable Sequential Teams and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a sequential decision-making problem, the information structure is the description of how events in the system occurring at different points in time affect each other. Classical models of reinforcement learning (e.g., MDPs, POMDPs) assume a simple and highly regular information structure, while more general models like predictive state representations do not explicitly model the information structure. By contrast, real-world sequential decision-making problems typically involve a complex and time-varying interdependence of system variables, requiring a rich and flexible representation of information structure. In this paper, we formalize a novel reinforcement learning model which explicitly represents the information structure. We then use this model to carry out an information-structural analysis of the statistical hardness of general sequential decision-making problems, obtaining a characterization via a graph-theoretic quantity of the DAG representation of the information structure. We prove an upper bound on the sample complexity of learning a general sequential decision-making problem in terms of its information structure by exhibiting an algorithm achieving the upper bound. This recovers known tractability results and gives a novel perspective on reinforcement learning in general sequential decision-making problems, providing a systematic way of identifying new tractable classes of problems.</description>

      <title>Position: Towards Implicit Prompt For Text-To-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have had great success, and many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their performance and safety. However, they only consider explicit prompts while neglecting implicit prompts (hint at a target without explicitly mentioning it). These prompts may get rid of safety constraints and pose potential threats to the applications of these models. This position paper highlights the current state of T2I models toward implicit prompts. We present a benchmark named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts of implicit prompts with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect more than 2,000 implicit prompts of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy, and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I models' capabilities under these implicit prompts. Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit prompts; (2) Implicit prompts bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit prompts. We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit prompts in the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of implicit prompts, advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits while mitigating their risks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of machine learning models using human-labeled validation data can be expensive and time-consuming. AI-labeled synthetic data can be used to decrease the number of human annotations required for this purpose in a process called autoevaluation. We suggest efficient and statistically principled algorithms for this purpose that improve sample efficiency while remaining unbiased. These algorithms increase the effective human-labeled sample size by up to 50% on experiments with GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Solvent-Aware 2D NMR Prediction: Leveraging Multi-Tasking Training and Iterative Self-Training Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is crucial across diverse scientific fields, revealing detailed structural information, electronic properties, and molecular dynamic insights. Accurate prediction of NMR peaks in a spectrum from molecular structures allows chemists to effectively evaluate candidate structures by comparing predictions with experimental shifts in an NMR spectra. This process facilitates peak assignments, thereby aiding in verifying molecular structures or identifying discrepancies. Although significant progress has been made in predicting 1D NMR with Machine Learning (ML) approaches, 2D NMR prediction remains a challenge due to the lack of an annotated 2D NMR training dataset. To address this gap, we propose an Iterative Unsupervised Learning (IUL) approach to train a machine learning model for predicting atomic 2D NMR cross peaks and annotating peaks in experimental 2D NMR spectra. Initially, the model undergoes a Multi-Task pre-Training (MTT) phase using a set of annotated 1D 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Then, the model is iteratively improved through a fine-tuning process with IUL, alternating between using the model to annotate the unlabeled 2D NMR data and refining the model using the newly generated annotations. Using the proposed approach, we trained our model on 19,000 Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra, tested it on 500 HSQC spectra with expert annotations, and further compared it with two traditional methods (ChemDraw and Mestrenova) on another expert-annotated HSQC dataset. For HSQC cross peak prediction, our model achieves MAE of 2.035 ppm and 0.163 ppm for 13C shifts and 1H shifts on the test dataset, respectively, and outperforms the conventional tools. This performance demonstrates not only the model's capability in accurately predicting chemical shifts, but also its effectiveness in peak assignments for experimental HSQC spectra.</description>

      <title>Detoxifying Large Language Models via Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14472v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates using knowledge editing techniques to detoxify Large Language Models (LLMs). We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to detoxify LLMs with a limited impact on general performance efficiently. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</description>

      <title>Multiple-policy Evaluation via Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the multiple-policy evaluation problem where we are given a set of $K$ policies and the goal is to evaluate their performance (expected total reward over a fixed horizon) to an accuracy $\epsilon$ with probability at least $1-\delta$. We propose an algorithm named $\mathrm{CAESAR}$ for this problem. Our approach is based on computing an approximate optimal offline sampling distribution and using the data sampled from it to perform the simultaneous estimation of the policy values. $\mathrm{CAESAR}$ has two phases. In the first we produce coarse estimates of the visitation distributions of the target policies at a low order sample complexity rate that scales with $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. In the second phase, we approximate the optimal offline sampling distribution and compute the importance weighting ratios for all target policies by minimizing a step-wise quadratic loss function inspired by the DualDICE \cite{nachum2019dualdice} objective. Up to low order and logarithmic terms $\mathrm{CAESAR}$ achieves a sample complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{H^4}{\epsilon^2}\sum_{h=1}^H\max_{k\in[K]}\sum_{s,a}\frac{(d_h^{\pi^k}(s,a))^2}{\mu^*_h(s,a)}\right)$, where $d^{\pi}$ is the visitation distribution of policy $\pi$, $\mu^*$ is the optimal sampling distribution, and $H$ is the horizon.</description>

      <title>PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the "Noise &amp; Zero" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the "residual" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA (PiSSA with 4-bit quantization) exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA.</description>

      <title>ROPO: Robust Preference Optimization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference alignment is pivotal for empowering large language models (LLMs) to generate helpful and harmless responses. However, the performance of preference alignment is highly sensitive to the prevalent noise in the preference data. Recent efforts for this problem either marginally alleviate the impact of noise without the ability to actually reduce its presence, or rely on costly teacher LLMs prone to reward misgeneralization. To address these challenges, we propose the RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO) framework, an iterative alignment approach that integrates noise-tolerance and filtering of noisy samples without the aid of external models. Specifically, ROPO iteratively solves a constrained optimization problem, where we dynamically assign a quality-aware weight for each sample and constrain the sum of the weights to the number of samples we intend to retain. For noise-tolerant training and effective noise identification, we derive a robust loss by suppressing the gradients of samples with high uncertainty. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that the derived loss is critical for distinguishing noisy samples from clean ones. Furthermore, inspired by our derived loss, we propose a robustness-guided rejection sampling technique to compensate for the potential important information in discarded queries. Experiments on three widely-used datasets with Mistral-7B and Llama-2-7B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing preference alignment methods, with its superiority growing as the noise rate increases.</description>

      <title>Identity Decoupling for Multi-Subject Personalization of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixed identities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation (Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline.</description>

      <title>VietMed: A Dataset and Benchmark for Automatic Speech Recognition of Vietnamese in the Medical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to privacy restrictions, there's a shortage of publicly available speech recognition datasets in the medical domain. In this work, we present VietMed - a Vietnamese speech recognition dataset in the medical domain comprising 16h of labeled medical speech, 1000h of unlabeled medical speech and 1200h of unlabeled general-domain speech. To our best knowledge, VietMed is by far the world's largest public medical speech recognition dataset in 7 aspects: total duration, number of speakers, diseases, recording conditions, speaker roles, unique medical terms and accents. VietMed is also by far the largest public Vietnamese speech dataset in terms of total duration. Additionally, we are the first to present a medical ASR dataset covering all ICD-10 disease groups and all accents within a country. Moreover, we release the first public large-scale pre-trained models for Vietnamese ASR, w2v2-Viet and XLSR-53-Viet, along with the first public large-scale fine-tuned models for medical ASR. Even without any medical data in unsupervised pre-training, our best pre-trained model XLSR-53-Viet generalizes very well to the medical domain by outperforming state-of-the-art XLSR-53, from 51.8% to 29.6% WER on test set (a relative reduction of more than 40%). All code, data and models are made publicly available: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed.</description>

      <title>Improved Generalization Bounds for Communication Efficient Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on reducing the communication cost of federated learning by exploring generalization bounds and representation learning. We first characterize a tighter generalization bound for one-round federated learning based on local clients' generalizations and heterogeneity of data distribution (non-iid scenario). We also characterize a generalization bound in R-round federated learning and its relation to the number of local updates (local stochastic gradient descents (SGDs)). Then, based on our generalization bound analysis and our representation learning interpretation of this analysis, we show for the first time that less frequent aggregations, hence more local updates, for the representation extractor (usually corresponds to initial layers) leads to the creation of more generalizable models, particularly for non-iid scenarios. We design a novel Federated Learning with Adaptive Local Steps (FedALS) algorithm based on our generalization bound and representation learning analysis. FedALS employs varying aggregation frequencies for different parts of the model, so reduces the communication cost. The paper is followed with experimental results showing the effectiveness of FedALS.</description>

      <title>Token-level Direct Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential to align them with human values and intentions. This process often utilizes methods like pairwise comparisons and KL divergence against a reference LLM, focusing on the evaluation of full answers generated by the models. However, the generation of these responses occurs in a token level, following a sequential, auto-regressive fashion. In this paper, we introduce Token-level Direct Preference Optimization (TDPO), a novel approach to align LLMs with human preferences by optimizing policy at the token level. Unlike previous methods, which face challenges in divergence efficiency, TDPO incorporates forward KL divergence constraints for each token, improving alignment and diversity. Utilizing the Bradley-Terry model for a token-based reward system, TDPO enhances the regulation of KL divergence, while preserving simplicity without the need for explicit reward modeling. Experimental results across various text tasks demonstrate TDPO's superior performance in balancing alignment with generation diversity. Notably, fine-tuning with TDPO strikes a better balance than DPO in the controlled sentiment generation and single-turn dialogue datasets, and significantly improves the quality of generated responses compared to both DPO and PPO-based RLHF methods. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Vance0124/Token-level-Direct-Preference-Optimization.</description>

Abstract: When neural networks are confronted with unfamiliar data that deviate from their training set, this signifies a domain shift. While these networks output predictions on their inputs, they typically fail to account for their level of familiarity with these novel observations. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in resource-constrained settings, such as embedded systems or edge devices. To address such challenges, we aim to recalibrate a neural network's decision boundaries in relation to its cognizance of the data it observes, introducing an approach we coin as certainty distillation. While prevailing works navigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the goal of curtailing model entropy, they unintentionally birth models that grapple with calibration inaccuracies - a dilemma we term the over-certainty phenomenon. In this paper, we probe the drawbacks of this traditional learning model. As a solution to the issue, we propose a UDA algorithm that not only augments accuracy but also assures model calibration, all while maintaining suitability for environments with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Redefining Safety for Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing definitions and associated conceptual frameworks for computer-based system safety should be revisited in light of real-world experiences from deploying autonomous vehicles. Current terminology used by industry safety standards emphasizes mitigation of risk from specifically identified hazards, and carries assumptions based on human-supervised vehicle operation. Operation without a human driver dramatically increases the scope of safety concerns, especially due to operation in an open world environment, a requirement to self-enforce operational limits, participation in an ad hoc sociotechnical system of systems, and a requirement to conform to both legal and ethical constraints. Existing standards and terminology only partially address these new challenges. We propose updated definitions for core system safety concepts that encompass these additional considerations as a starting point for evolving safe-ty approaches to address these additional safety challenges. These results might additionally inform framing safety terminology for other autonomous system applications.</description>

      <title>Soft Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models to Expert Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Soft Preference Optimization (SPO), a method for aligning generative models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with human preferences, without the need for a reward model. SPO optimizes model outputs directly over a preference dataset through a natural loss function that integrates preference loss with a regularization term across the model's entire output distribution rather than limiting it to the preference dataset. Although SPO does not require the assumption of an existing underlying reward model, we demonstrate that, under the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, it converges to a softmax of scaled rewards, with the distribution's "softness" adjustable via the softmax exponent, an algorithm parameter. We showcase SPO's methodology, its theoretical foundation, and its comparative advantages in simplicity, computational efficiency, and alignment precision.</description>

      <title>RICE: Breaking Through the Training Bottlenecks of Reinforcement Learning with Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge. The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks. The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-enhanced Dual Semi-supervised Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study semi-supervised graph classification, which aims at accurately predicting the categories of graphs in scenarios with limited labeled graphs and abundant unlabeled graphs. Despite the promising capability of graph neural networks (GNNs), they typically require a large number of costly labeled graphs, while a wealth of unlabeled graphs fail to be effectively utilized. Moreover, GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local neighborhood information using message-passing mechanisms, thus lacking the ability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named HEAL for semi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from the perspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically, to better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a hypergraph structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies beyond pairwise relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we introduce a line graph to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby better mining the underlying semantic structures. Finally, we develop a relational consistency learning to facilitate knowledge transfer between the two branches and provide better mutual guidance. Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Double Correction Framework for Denoising Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As its availability and generality in online services, implicit feedback is more commonly used in recommender systems. However, implicit feedback usually presents noisy samples in real-world recommendation scenarios (such as misclicks or non-preferential behaviors), which will affect precise user preference learning. To overcome the noisy samples problem, a popular solution is based on dropping noisy samples in the model training phase, which follows the observation that noisy samples have higher training losses than clean samples. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that this solution still has limits. (1) High training losses can result from model optimization instability or hard samples, not just noisy samples. (2) Completely dropping of noisy samples will aggravate the data sparsity, which lacks full data exploitation. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a Double Correction Framework for Denoising Recommendation (DCF), which contains two correction components from views of more precise sample dropping and avoiding more sparse data. In the sample dropping correction component, we use the loss value of the samples over time to determine whether it is noise or not, increasing dropping stability. Instead of averaging directly, we use the damping function to reduce the bias effect of outliers. Furthermore, due to the higher variance exhibited by hard samples, we derive a lower bound for the loss through concentration inequality to identify and reuse hard samples. In progressive label correction, we iteratively re-label highly deterministic noisy samples and retrain them to further improve performance. Finally, extensive experimental results on three datasets and four backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Intuitive Fine-Tuning: Towards Simplifying Alignment into a Single Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are two fundamental processes for enhancing the capabilities of Language Models (LMs) post pre-training, aligning them better with human preferences. Although SFT advances in training efficiency, PO delivers better alignment, thus they are often combined. However, common practices simply apply them sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives, ignoring the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. To obtain a unified understanding, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes -- Preference Estimation and Transition Optimization -- defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. This modeling shows that SFT is only a specialized case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO evaluates the quality of model's entire generated answer, whereas SFT only scores predicted tokens based on preceding tokens from target answers. Therefore, SFT overestimates the ability of model, leading to inferior optimization. Building on this view, we introduce Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT) to integrate SFT and Preference Optimization into a single process. IFT captures LMs' intuitive sense of the entire answers through a temporal residual connection, but it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to sequential recipes of SFT and some typical Preference Optimization methods across several tasks, particularly those requires generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy.</description>

      <title>Future You: A Conversation with an AI-Generated Future Self Reduces Anxiety, Negative Emotions, and Increases Future Self-Continuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce "Future You," an interactive, brief, single-session, digital chat intervention designed to improve future self-continuity--the degree of connection an individual feels with a temporally distant future self--a characteristic that is positively related to mental health and wellbeing. Our system allows users to chat with a relatable yet AI-powered virtual version of their future selves that is tuned to their future goals and personal qualities. To make the conversation realistic, the system generates a "synthetic memory"--a unique backstory for each user--that creates a throughline between the user's present age (between 18-30) and their life at age 60. The "Future You" character also adopts the persona of an age-progressed image of the user's present self. After a brief interaction with the "Future You" character, users reported decreased anxiety, and increased future self-continuity. This is the first study successfully demonstrating the use of personalized AI-generated characters to improve users' future self-continuity and wellbeing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a mathematical foundation for the Adam optimizer, elucidating its connection to natural gradient descent through Riemannian and information geometry. We rigorously analyze the diagonal empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) in Adam, clarifying all detailed approximations and advocating for the use of log probability functions as loss, which should be based on discrete distributions, due to the limitations of empirical FIM. Our analysis uncovers flaws in the original Adam algorithm, leading to proposed corrections such as enhanced momentum calculations, adjusted bias corrections, adaptive epsilon, and gradient clipping. We refine the weight decay term based on our theoretical framework. Our modified algorithm, Fisher Adam (FAdam), demonstrates superior performance across diverse domains including LLM, ASR, and VQ-VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results in ASR.</description>

      <title>PDMLP: Patch-based Decomposed MLP for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based Decomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often limited by the large amount of data needed to learn a successful policy. Offline RL aims to solve this issue by using transitions collected by a different behavior policy. We address a novel Offline RL problem setting in which, while collecting the dataset, the transition and reward functions gradually change between episodes but stay constant within each episode. We propose a method based on Contrastive Predictive Coding that identifies this non-stationarity in the offline dataset, accounts for it when training a policy, and predicts it during evaluation. We analyze our proposed method and show that it performs well in simple continuous control tasks and challenging, high-dimensional locomotion tasks. We show that our method often achieves the oracle performance and performs better than baselines.</description>

      <title>Let's Fuse Step by Step: A Generative Fusion Decoding Algorithm with LLMs for Multi-modal Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce "Generative Fusion Decoding" (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework, utilized to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-modal text recognition systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the formulas necessary to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by mapping text token space to byte token space, enabling seamless fusion during the decoding process. The framework is plug-and-play, compatible with various auto-regressive models, and does not require re-training for feature alignment, thus overcoming limitations of previous fusion techniques. We highlight three main advantages of GFD: First, by simplifying the complexity of aligning different model sample spaces, GFD allows LLMs to correct errors in tandem with the recognition model, reducing computation latencies. Second, the in-context learning ability of LLMs is fully capitalized by GFD, increasing robustness in long-form speech recognition and instruction aware speech recognition. Third, GFD enables fusing recognition models deficient in Chinese text recognition with LLMs extensively trained on Chinese. Our evaluation demonstrates that GFD significantly improves performance in ASR and OCR tasks, with ASR reaching state-of-the-art in the NTUML2021 benchmark. GFD provides a significant step forward in model integration, offering a unified solution that could be widely applicable to leveraging existing pre-trained models through step by step fusion.</description>

      <title>Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</description>

      <title>Integer Scale: A Free Lunch for Faster Fine-grained Quantization of LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Integer Scale, a novel post-training quantization scheme for large language models that effectively resolves the inference bottleneck in current fine-grained quantization approaches while maintaining similar accuracies. Integer Scale is a free lunch as it requires no extra calibration or fine-tuning which will otherwise incur additional costs. It can be used plug-and-play for most fine-grained quantization methods. Its integration results in at most 1.85x end-to-end speed boost over the original counterpart with comparable accuracy. Additionally, due to the orchestration of the proposed Integer Scale and fine-grained quantization, we resolved the quantization difficulty for Mixtral-8x7B and LLaMA-3 models with negligible performance degradation, and it comes with an end-to-end speed boost of 2.13x, and 2.31x compared with their FP16 versions respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating content across various modalities, such as images and text. However, their interpretability remains a challenge, hindering their adoption in critical applications. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of MLLMs by focusing on the image embedding component. We combine an open-world localization model with a MLLM, thus creating a new architecture able to simultaneously produce text and object localization outputs from the same vision embedding. The proposed architecture greatly promotes interpretability, enabling us to design a novel saliency map to explain any output token, to identify model hallucinations, and to assess model biases through semantic adversarial perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Better Load Estimates by Combining Anomaly and Change-point Detection in Power Grid Time-series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present novel methodology for automatic anomaly and switch event filtering to improve load estimation in power grid systems. By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>VOODOO XP: Expressive One-Shot Head Reenactment for VR Telepresence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce VOODOO XP: a 3D-aware one-shot head reenactment method that can generate highly expressive facial expressions from any input driver video and a single 2D portrait. Our solution is real-time, view-consistent, and can be instantly used without calibration or fine-tuning. We demonstrate our solution on a monocular video setting and an end-to-end VR telepresence system for two-way communication. Compared to 2D head reenactment methods, 3D-aware approaches aim to preserve the identity of the subject and ensure view-consistent facial geometry for novel camera poses, which makes them suitable for immersive applications. While various facial disentanglement techniques have been introduced, cutting-edge 3D-aware neural reenactment techniques still lack expressiveness and fail to reproduce complex and fine-scale facial expressions. We present a novel cross-reenactment architecture that directly transfers the driver's facial expressions to transformer blocks of the input source's 3D lifting module. We show that highly effective disentanglement is possible using an innovative multi-stage self-supervision approach, which is based on a coarse-to-fine strategy, combined with an explicit face neutralization and 3D lifted frontalization during its initial training stage. We further integrate our novel head reenactment solution into an accessible high-fidelity VR telepresence system, where any person can instantly build a personalized neural head avatar from any photo and bring it to life using the headset. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of expressiveness and likeness preservation on a large set of diverse subjects and capture conditions.</description>

      <title>Picturing Ambiguity: A Visual Twist on the Winograd Schema Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WinoVis, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WinoVis, only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Detector Design for the EIC (AID(2)E)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform the design of complex, large-scale detectors like the ePIC at the future Electron Ion Collider. Featuring a central detector with additional detecting systems in the far forward and far backward regions, the ePIC experiment incorporates numerous design parameters and objectives, including performance, physics reach, and cost, constrained by mechanical and geometric limits. This project aims to develop a scalable, distributed AI-assisted detector design for the EIC (AID(2)E), employing state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization to tackle complex designs. Supported by the ePIC software stack and using Geant4 simulations, our approach benefits from transparent parameterization and advanced AI features. The workflow leverages the PanDA and iDDS systems, used in major experiments such as ATLAS at CERN LHC, the Rubin Observatory, and sPHENIX at RHIC, to manage the compute intensive demands of ePIC detector simulations. Tailored enhancements to the PanDA system focus on usability, scalability, automation, and monitoring. Ultimately, this project aims to establish a robust design capability, apply a distributed AI-assisted workflow to the ePIC detector, and extend its applications to the design of the second detector (Detector-2) in the EIC, as well as to calibration and alignment tasks. Additionally, we are developing advanced data science tools to efficiently navigate the complex, multidimensional trade-offs identified through this optimization process.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Foreground and Background Motion for Enhanced Realism in Human Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in human video synthesis have enabled the generation of high-quality videos through the application of stable diffusion models. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on animating solely the human element (the foreground) guided by pose information, while leaving the background entirely static. Contrary to this, in authentic, high-quality videos, backgrounds often dynamically adjust in harmony with foreground movements, eschewing stagnancy. We introduce a technique that concurrently learns both foreground and background dynamics by segregating their movements using distinct motion representations. Human figures are animated leveraging pose-based motion, capturing intricate actions. Conversely, for backgrounds, we employ sparse tracking points to model motion, thereby reflecting the natural interaction between foreground activity and environmental changes. Training on real-world videos enhanced with this innovative motion depiction approach, our model generates videos exhibiting coherent movement in both foreground subjects and their surrounding contexts. To further extend video generation to longer sequences without accumulating errors, we adopt a clip-by-clip generation strategy, introducing global features at each step. To ensure seamless continuity across these segments, we ingeniously link the final frame of a produced clip with input noise to spawn the succeeding one, maintaining narrative flow. Throughout the sequential generation process, we infuse the feature representation of the initial reference image into the network, effectively curtailing any cumulative color inconsistencies that may otherwise arise. Empirical evaluations attest to the superiority of our method in producing videos that exhibit harmonious interplay between foreground actions and responsive background dynamics, surpassing prior methodologies in this regard.</description>

      <title>Causal Concept Embedding Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying a deep neural network's (DNN) reasoning. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, causal opacity represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Embedding Models (Causal CEMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. The results of our experiments show that Causal CEMs can: (i) match the generalization performance of causally-opaque models, (ii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness, and (iii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also accuracy of the explanation provided for a specific instance.</description>

      <title>ID-to-3D: Expressive ID-guided 3D Heads via Score Distillation Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose ID-to-3D, a method to generate identity- and text-guided 3D human heads with disentangled expressions, starting from even a single casually captured in-the-wild image of a subject. The foundation of our approach is anchored in compositionality, alongside the use of task-specific 2D diffusion models as priors for optimization. First, we extend a foundational model with a lightweight expression-aware and ID-aware architecture, and create 2D priors for geometry and texture generation, via fine-tuning only 0.2% of its available training parameters. Then, we jointly leverage a neural parametric representation for the expressions of each subject and a multi-stage generation of highly detailed geometry and albedo texture. This combination of strong face identity embeddings and our neural representation enables accurate reconstruction of not only facial features but also accessories and hair and can be meshed to provide render-ready assets for gaming and telepresence. Our results achieve an unprecedented level of identity-consistent and high-quality texture and geometry generation, generalizing to a ``world'' of unseen 3D identities, without relying on large 3D captured datasets of human assets.</description>

      <title>Entity Alignment with Noisy Annotations from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entity alignment (EA) aims to merge two knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying equivalent entity pairs. While existing methods heavily rely on human-generated labels, it is prohibitively expensive to incorporate cross-domain experts for annotation in real-world scenarios. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating EA with annotations, inspired by their comprehensive capability to process semantic information. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply LLMs for EA since the annotation space in real-world KGs is large. LLMs could also generate noisy labels that may mislead the alignment. To this end, we propose a unified framework, LLM4EA, to effectively leverage LLMs for EA. Specifically, we design a novel active learning policy to significantly reduce the annotation space by prioritizing the most valuable entities based on the entire inter-KG and intra-KG structure. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised label refiner to continuously enhance label accuracy through in-depth probabilistic reasoning. We iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from a base EA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of LLM4EA on four benchmark datasets in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency.

      <title>Structured Graph Network for Constrained Robot Crowd Navigation with Low Fidelity Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for constrained crowd navigation using a low-fidelity simulator. We introduce a representation of the dynamic environment, separating human and obstacle representations. Humans are represented through detected states, while obstacles are represented as computed point clouds based on maps and robot localization. This representation enables RL policies trained in a low-fidelity simulator to deploy in real world with a reduced sim2real gap. Additionally, we propose a spatio-temporal graph to model the interactions between agents and obstacles. Based on the graph, we use attention mechanisms to capture the robot-human, human-human, and human-obstacle interactions. Our method significantly improves navigation performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

      <title>Transfer Learning for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on Gaussian mixture simulations and on real electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.</description>

      <title>VoCoT: Unleashing Visually Grounded Multi-Step Reasoning in Large Multi-Modal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their effectiveness in handling complex tasks has been limited by the prevailing single-step reasoning paradigm. To this end, this paper proposes VoCoT, a multi-step Visually grounded object-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework tailored for inference with LMMs. VoCoT is characterized by two key features: (1) object-centric reasoning paths that revolve around cross-modal shared object-level information, and (2) visually grounded representation of object concepts in a multi-modal interleaved and aligned manner, which effectively bridges the modality gap within LMMs during long-term generation. Additionally, we construct an instruction dataset to facilitate LMMs in adapting to reasoning with VoCoT. By introducing VoCoT into the prevalent open-source LMM architecture, we introduce VolCano. With only 7B parameters and limited input resolution, VolCano demonstrates excellent performance across various scenarios, surpassing SOTA models, including GPT-4V, in tasks requiring complex reasoning. Our code, data and model will be available at https://github.com/RupertLuo/VoCoT.</description>

      <title>LLM-Optic: Unveiling the Capabilities of Large Language Models for Universal Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding is an essential tool that links user-provided text queries with query-specific regions within an image. Despite advancements in visual grounding models, their ability to comprehend complex queries remains limited. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LLM-Optic, an innovative method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as an optical lens to enhance existing visual grounding models in comprehending complex text queries involving intricate text structures, multiple objects, or object spatial relationships, situations that current models struggle with. LLM-Optic first employs an LLM as a Text Grounder to interpret complex text queries and accurately identify objects the user intends to locate. Then a pre-trained visual grounding model is used to generate candidate bounding boxes given the refined query by the Text Grounder. After that, LLM-Optic annotates the candidate bounding boxes with numerical marks to establish a connection between text and specific image regions, thereby linking two distinct modalities. Finally, it employs a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a Visual Grounder to select the marked candidate objects that best correspond to the original text query. Through LLM-Optic, we have achieved universal visual grounding, which allows for the detection of arbitrary objects specified by arbitrary human language input. Importantly, our method achieves this enhancement without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-Optic achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot visual grounding capabilities.
