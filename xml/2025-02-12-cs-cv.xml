      <title>VistaFlow: Photorealistic Volumetric Reconstruction with Dynamic Resolution Management via Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VistaFlow, a scalable three-dimensional imaging technique capable of reconstructing fully interactive 3D volumetric images from a set of 2D photographs. Our model synthesizes novel viewpoints through a differentiable rendering system capable of dynamic resolution management on photorealistic 3D scenes. We achieve this through the introduction of QuiQ, a novel intermediate video controller trained through Q-learning to maintain a consistently high framerate by adjusting render resolution with millisecond precision. Notably, VistaFlow runs natively on integrated CPU graphics, making it viable for mobile and entry-level devices while still delivering high-performance rendering. VistaFlow bypasses Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), using the PlenOctree data structure to render complex light interactions such as reflection and subsurface scattering with minimal hardware requirements. Our model is capable of outperforming state-of-the-art methods with novel view synthesis at a resolution of 1080p at over 100 frames per second on consumer hardware. By tailoring render quality to the capabilities of each device, VistaFlow has the potential to improve the efficiency and accessibility of photorealistic 3D scene rendering across a wide spectrum of hardware, from high-end workstations to inexpensive microcontrollers.</description>

      <title>L2GNet: Optimal Local-to-Global Representation of Anatomical Structures for Generalized Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Latent Space (CLS) and Discrete Latent Space (DLS) models, like AttnUNet and VQUNet, have excelled in medical image segmentation. In contrast, Synergistic Continuous and Discrete Latent Space (CDLS) models show promise in handling fine and coarse-grained information. However, they struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. CLS or CDLS-based models, such as TransUNet or SynergyNet are adept at capturing long-range dependencies. Since they rely heavily on feature pooling or aggregation using self-attention, they may capture dependencies among redundant regions. This hinders comprehension of anatomical structure content, poses challenges in modeling intra-class and inter-class dependencies, increases false negatives and compromises generalization. Addressing these issues, we propose L2GNet, which learns global dependencies by relating discrete codes obtained from DLS using optimal transport and aligning codes on a trainable reference. L2GNet achieves discriminative on-the-fly representation learning without an additional weight matrix in self-attention models, making it computationally efficient for medical applications. Extensive experiments on multi-organ segmentation and cardiac datasets demonstrate L2GNet's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, including the CDLS method SynergyNet, offering an novel approach to enhance deep learning models' performance in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>Survey on AI-Generated Media Detection: From Non-MLLM to MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated media poses significant challenges to information authenticity and social trust, making reliable detection methods highly demanded. Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Failure Detection with Human-Level Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable failure detection holds paramount importance in safety-critical applications. Yet, neural networks are known to produce overconfident predictions for misclassified samples. As a result, it remains a problematic matter as existing confidence score functions rely on category-level signals, the logits, to detect failures. This research introduces an innovative strategy, leveraging human-level concepts for a dual purpose: to reliably detect when a model fails and to transparently interpret why. By integrating a nuanced array of signals for each category, our method enables a finer-grained assessment of the model's confidence. We present a simple yet highly effective approach based on the ordinal ranking of concept activation to the input image. Without bells and whistles, our method significantly reduce the false positive rate across diverse real-world image classification benchmarks, specifically by 3.7% on ImageNet and 9% on EuroSAT.</description>

      <title>Invizo: Arabic Handwritten Document Optical Character Recognition Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting images of Arabic text into plain text is a widely researched topic in academia and industry. However, recognition of Arabic handwritten and printed text presents difficult challenges due to the complex nature of variations of the Arabic script. This work proposes an end-to-end solution for recognizing Arabic handwritten, printed, and Arabic numbers and presents the data in a structured manner. We reached 81.66% precision, 78.82% Recall, and 79.07% F-measure on a Text Detection task that powers the proposed solution. The proposed recognition model incorporates state-of-the-art CNN-based feature extraction, and Transformer-based sequence modeling to accommodate variations in handwriting styles, stroke thicknesses, alignments, and noise conditions. The evaluation of the model suggests its strong performances on both printed and handwritten texts, yielding 0.59% CER and &amp; 1.72% WER on printed text, and 7.91% CER and 31.41% WER on handwritten text. The overall proposed solution has proven to be relied on in real-life OCR tasks. Equipped with both detection and recognition models as well as other Feature Extraction and Matching helping algorithms. With the general purpose implementation, making the solution valid for any given document or receipt that is Arabic handwritten or printed. Thus, it is practical and useful for any given context.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism Prior for False Positive and Negative Problem in Medical Image Dense Contrastive Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL) has greatly improved the learning efficiency for image-dense prediction tasks, showing its great potential to reduce the large costs of medical image collection and dense annotation. However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&amp;N) pairs in DCRL. In this paper, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. We propose a deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) which models the homeomorphism of medical images and learns to estimate a deformable mapping to predict the pixels' correspondence under topological preservation. It effectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and soft learning of negative pairs via a gradient. We also propose a geometric semantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to measure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning. It will promote the learning efficiency and performance of deformation, constructing positive pairs reliably. We implement two practical variants on two typical representation learning tasks in our experiments. Our promising results on seven datasets which outperform the existing methods show our great superiority. We will release our code on a companion link: https://github.com/YutingHe-list/GEMINI.</description>

      <title>Drone Detection and Tracking with YOLO and a Rule-based Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones or unmanned aerial vehicles are traditionally used for military missions, warfare, and espionage. However, the usage of drones has significantly increased due to multiple industrial applications involving security and inspection, transportation, research purposes, and recreational drone flying. Such an increased volume of drone activity in public spaces requires regulatory actions for purposes of privacy protection and safety. Hence, detection of illegal drone activities such as boundary encroachment becomes a necessity. Such detection tasks are usually automated and performed by deep learning models which are trained on annotated image datasets. This paper builds on a previous work and extends an already published open source dataset. A description and analysis of the entire dataset is provided. The dataset is used to train the YOLOv7 deep learning model and some of its minor variants and the results are provided. Since the detection models are based on a single image input, a simple cross-correlation based tracker is used to reduce detection drops and improve tracking performance in videos. Finally, the entire drone detection system is summarized.</description>

      <title>Towards Fine-grained Renal Vasculature Segmentation: Full-Scale Hierarchical Learning with FH-Seg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fine-grained segmentation of the renal vasculature is critical for nephrological analysis, yet it faces challenges due to diverse and insufficiently annotated images. Existing methods struggle to accurately segment intricate regions of the renal vasculature, such as the inner and outer walls, arteries and lesions. In this paper, we introduce FH-Seg, a Full-scale Hierarchical Learning Framework designed for comprehensive segmentation of the renal vasculature. Specifically, FH-Seg employs full-scale skip connections that merge detailed anatomical information with contextual semantics across scales, effectively bridging the gap between structural and pathological contexts. Additionally, we implement a learnable hierarchical soft attention gates to adaptively reduce interference from non-core information, enhancing the focus on critical vascular features. To advance research on renal pathology segmentation, we also developed a Large Renal Vasculature (LRV) dataset, which contains 16,212 fine-grained annotated images of 5,600 renal arteries. Extensive experiments on the LRV dataset demonstrate FH-Seg's superior accuracies (71.23% Dice, 73.06% F1), outperforming Omni-Seg by 2.67 and 2.13 percentage points respectively. Code is available at: https://github.com/hrlblab/FH-seg.</description>

      <title>NextBestPath: Efficient 3D Mapping of Unseen Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of active 3D mapping, where an agent must find an efficient trajectory to exhaustively reconstruct a new scene. Previous approaches mainly predict the next best view near the agent's location, which is prone to getting stuck in local areas. Additionally, existing indoor datasets are insufficient due to limited geometric complexity and inaccurate ground truth meshes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset AiMDoom with a map generator for the Doom video game, enabling to better benchmark active 3D mapping in diverse indoor environments. Moreover, we propose a new method we call next-best-path (NBP), which predicts long-term goals rather than focusing solely on short-sighted views. The model jointly predicts accumulated surface coverage gains for long-term goals and obstacle maps, allowing it to efficiently plan optimal paths with a unified model. By leveraging online data collection, data augmentation and curriculum learning, NBP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the existing MP3D dataset and our AiMDoom dataset, achieving more efficient mapping in indoor environments of varying complexity.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Structure-Aware Artistic Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic style transfer aims to use a style image and a content image to synthesize a target image that retains the same artistic expression as the style image while preserving the basic content of the content image. Many recently proposed style transfer methods have a common problem; that is, they simply transfer the texture and color of the style image to the global structure of the content image. As a result, the content image has a local structure that is not similar to the local structure of the style image. In this paper, we present an effective method that can be used to transfer style patterns while fusing the local style structure into the local content structure. In our method, dif-ferent levels of coarse stylized features are first reconstructed at low resolution using a Coarse Network, in which style color distribution is roughly transferred, and the content structure is combined with the style structure. Then, the reconstructed features and the content features are adopted to synthesize high-quality structure-aware stylized images with high resolution using a Fine Network with three structural selective fusion (SSF) modules. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the generation of appealing high-quality stylization results and a com-parison with some state-of-the-art style transfer methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond and Free from Diffusion: Invertible Guided Consistency Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance in image generation steers models towards higher-quality or more targeted outputs, typically achieved in Diffusion Models (DMs) via Classifier-free Guidance (CFG). However, recent Consistency Models (CMs), which offer fewer function evaluations, rely on distilling CFG knowledge from pretrained DMs to achieve guidance, making them costly and inflexible. In this work, we propose invertible Guided Consistency Training (iGCT), a novel training framework for guided CMs that is entirely data-driven. iGCT, as a pioneering work, contributes to fast and guided image generation and editing without requiring the training and distillation of DMs, greatly reducing the overall compute requirements. iGCT addresses the saturation artifacts seen in CFG under high guidance scales. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet64 show that iGCT significantly improves FID and precision compared to CFG. At a guidance of 13, iGCT improves precision to 0.8, while DM's drops to 0.47. Our work takes the first step toward enabling guidance and inversion for CMs without relying on DMs.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Deep Colorization for Image Compression: A Color Grid Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for image compression optimization techniques is a topic of constant interest both in and out of academic circles. One method that shows promise toward future improvements in this field is image colorization since image colorization algorithms can reduce the amount of color data that needs to be stored for an image. Our work focuses on optimizing a color grid based approach to fully-automated image color information retention with regard to convolutional colorization network architecture for the purposes of image compression. More generally, using a convolutional neural network for image re-colorization, we want to minimize the amount of color information that is stored while still being able to faithfully re-color images. Our results yielded a promising image compression ratio, while still allowing for successful image recolorization reaching high CSIM values.</description>

      <title>Vision-in-the-loop Simulation for Deep Monocular Pose Estimation of UAV in Ocean Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a vision-in-the-loop simulation environment for deep monocular pose estimation of a UAV operating in an ocean environment. Recently, a deep neural network with a transformer architecture has been successfully trained to estimate the pose of a UAV relative to the flight deck of a research vessel, overcoming several limitations of GPS-based approaches. However, validating the deep pose estimation scheme in an actual ocean environment poses significant challenges due to the limited availability of research vessels and the associated operational costs. To address these issues, we present a photo-realistic 3D virtual environment leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian splatting, a novel technique that represents 3D scenes by modeling image pixels as Gaussian distributions in 3D space, creating a lightweight and high-quality visual model from multiple viewpoints. This approach enables the creation of a virtual environment integrating multiple real-world images collected in situ. The resulting simulation enables the indoor testing of flight maneuvers while verifying all aspects of flight software, hardware, and the deep monocular pose estimation scheme. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for testing and validating the autonomous flight of shipboard UAVs, specifically focusing on vision-based control and estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Show-o Turbo: Towards Accelerated Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in building unified multimodal understanding and generation models, among which Show-o stands as a notable representative, demonstrating great promise for both text-to-image and image-to-text generation. The inference of Show-o involves progressively denoising image tokens and autoregressively decoding text tokens, and hence, unfortunately, suffers from inefficiency issues from both sides. This paper introduces Show-o Turbo to bridge the gap. We first identify a unified denoising perspective for the generation of images and text in Show-o based on the parallel decoding of text tokens. We then propose to extend consistency distillation (CD), a qualified approach for shortening the denoising process of diffusion models, to the multimodal denoising trajectories of Show-o. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy and a curriculum learning procedure to improve the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation, Show-o Turbo displays a GenEval score of 0.625 at 4 sampling steps without using classifier-free guidance (CFG), outperforming that of the original Show-o with 8 steps and CFG; in image-to-text generation, Show-o Turbo exhibits a 1.5x speedup without significantly sacrificing performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/Show-o-Turbo.</description>

      <title>LRA-GNN: Latent Relation-Aware Graph Neural Network with Initial and Dynamic Residual for Facial Age Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face information is mainly concentrated among facial key points, and frontier research has begun to use graph neural networks to segment faces into patches as nodes to model complex face representations. However, these methods construct node-to-node relations based on similarity thresholds, so there is a problem that some latent relations are missing. These latent relations are crucial for deep semantic representation of face aging. In this novel, we propose a new Latent Relation-Aware Graph Neural Network with Initial and Dynamic Residual (LRA-GNN) to achieve robust and comprehensive facial representation. Specifically, we first construct an initial graph utilizing facial key points as prior knowledge, and then a random walk strategy is employed to the initial graph for obtaining the global structure, both of which together guide the subsequent effective exploration and comprehensive representation. Then LRA-GNN leverages the multi-attention mechanism to capture the latent relations and generates a set of fully connected graphs containing rich facial information and complete structure based on the aforementioned guidance. To avoid over-smoothing issues for deep feature extraction on the fully connected graphs, the deep residual graph convolutional networks are carefully designed, which fuse adaptive initial residuals and dynamic developmental residuals to ensure the consistency and diversity of information. Finally, to improve the estimation accuracy and generalization ability, progressive reinforcement learning is proposed to optimize the ensemble classification regressor. Our proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines on several age estimation benchmarks, demonstrating its strength and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>MoFM: A Large-Scale Human Motion Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AFoundation Models (FM) have increasingly drawn the attention of researchers due to their scalability and generalization across diverse tasks. Inspired by the success of FMs and the principles that have driven advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce MoFM as a novel Motion Foundation Model. MoFM is designed for the semantic understanding of complex human motions in both time and space. To facilitate large-scale training, MotionBook, a comprehensive human motion dictionary of discretized motions is designed and employed. MotionBook utilizes Thermal Cubes to capture spatio-temporal motion heatmaps, applying principles from discrete variational models to encode human movements into discrete units for a more efficient and scalable representation. MoFM, trained on a large corpus of motion data, provides a foundational backbone adaptable to diverse downstream tasks, supporting paradigms such as one-shot, unsupervised, and supervised tasks. This versatility makes MoFM well-suited for a wide range of motion-based applications.</description>

      <title>AdaFlow: Efficient Long Video Editing via Adaptive Attention Slimming And Keyframe Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite great progress, text-driven long video editing is still notoriously challenging mainly due to excessive memory overhead. Although recent efforts have simplified this task into a two-step process of keyframe translation and interpolation generation, the token-wise keyframe translation still plagues the upper limit of video length. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach towards efficient and effective long video editing, termed AdaFlow. We first reveal that not all tokens of video frames hold equal importance for keyframe translation, based on which we propose an Adaptive Attention Slimming scheme for AdaFlow to squeeze the $KV$ sequence, thus increasing the number of keyframes for translations by an order of magnitude. In addition, an Adaptive Keyframe Selection scheme is also equipped to select the representative frames for joint editing, further improving generation quality. With these innovative designs, AdaFlow achieves high-quality long video editing of minutes in one inference, i.e., more than 1$k$ frames on one A800 GPU, which is about ten times longer than the compared methods, e.g., TokenFlow. To validate AdaFlow, we also build a new benchmark for long video editing with high-quality annotations, termed LongV-EVAL. Our code is released at: https://github.com/jidantang55/AdaFlow.</description>

      <title>Content-based Video Retrieval in Traffic Videos using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Content-based video retrieval is one of the most challenging tasks in surveillance systems. In this study, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is used to annotate surveillance videos in an unsupervised manner. In scene understanding methods, some of the learned patterns are ambiguous and represents a mixture of atomic actions. To address the ambiguity issue in the proposed method, feature vectors, and the primary model are processed to obtain a secondary model which describes the scene with primitive patterns that lack any ambiguity. Experiments show performance improvement in the retrieval task compared to other topic model-based methods. In terms of false positive and true positive responses, the proposed method achieves at least 80\% and 124\% improvement respectively. Four search strategies are proposed, and users can define and search for a variety of activities using the proposed query formulation which is based on topic models. In addition, the lightweight database in our method occupies much fewer storage which in turn speeds up the search procedure compared to the methods which are based on low-level features.</description>

      <title>Block Graph Neural Networks for tumor heterogeneity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate tumor classification is essential for selecting effective treatments, but current methods have limitations. Standard tumor grading, which categorizes tumors based on cell differentiation, is not recommended as a stand-alone procedure, as some well-differentiated tumors can be malignant. Tumor heterogeneity assessment via single-cell sequencing offers profound insights but can be costly and may still require significant manual intervention. Many existing statistical machine learning methods for tumor data still require complex pre-processing of MRI and histopathological data.
  In this paper, we propose to build on a mathematical model that simulates tumor evolution (O\.{z}a\'{n}ski (2017)) and generate artificial datasets for tumor classification. Tumor heterogeneity is estimated using normalized entropy, with a threshold to classify tumors as having high or low heterogeneity. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the cut and graph generation processes from the artificial data, (2) the design of tumor features, and (3) the construction of Block Graph Neural Networks (BGNN), a Graph Neural Network-based approach to predict tumor heterogeneity. The experimental results reveal that the combination of the proposed features and models yields excellent results on artificially generated data ($89.67\%$ accuracy on the test data). In particular, in alignment with the emerging trends in AI-assisted grading and spatial transcriptomics, our results suggest that enriching traditional grading methods with birth (e.g., Ki-67 proliferation index) and death markers can improve heterogeneity prediction and enhance tumor classification.</description>

      <title>DCENWCNet: A Deep CNN Ensemble Network for White Blood Cell Classification with LIME-Based Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system, and they protect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. A traditional method, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can classify the blood cell from a part of an object and perform object recognition. Various CNN models exhibit potential; however, their development often involves ad-hoc processes that neglect unnecessary layers, leading to issues with unbalanced datasets and insufficient data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates three CNN architectures, each uniquely configured with different dropout and max-pooling layer settings to enhance feature learning. This ensemble model, named DCENWCNet, effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off. When evaluated on the widely recognized Rabbin-WBC dataset, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks, achieving highest mean accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) across all categories. To delve deeper into the interpretability of classifiers, we employ reliable post-hoc explanation techniques, including Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods approximate the behavior of a black-box model by elucidating the relationships between feature values and predictions. Interpretable results enable users to comprehend and validate the model's predictions, thereby increasing their confidence in the automated diagnosis.</description>

      <title>LMS-Net: A Learned Mumford-Shah Network For Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) methods have shown great promise in handling data-scarce scenarios, particularly in medical image segmentation tasks. However, most existing FSS architectures lack sufficient interpretability and fail to fully incorporate the underlying physical structures of semantic regions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel deep unfolding network, called the Learned Mumford-Shah Network (LMS-Net), for the FSS task. Specifically, motivated by the effectiveness of pixel-to-prototype comparison in prototypical FSS methods and the capability of deep priors to model complex spatial structures, we leverage our learned Mumford-Shah model (LMS model) as a mathematical foundation to integrate these insights into a unified framework. By reformulating the LMS model into prototype update and mask update tasks, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve it efficiently. Further, the iterative steps of this algorithm are unfolded into corresponding network modules, resulting in LMS-Net with clear interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly available medical segmentation datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex structures and adapting to challenging segmentation scenarios. These results highlight the potential of LMS-Net to advance FSS in medical imaging applications. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/SDZhang01/LMSNet</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates a novel use of the U-Net architecture in the field of semantic segmentation to detect landforms using preprocessed satellite imagery. The study applies the U-Net model for effective feature extraction by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) segmentation techniques. Dropout is strategically used for regularization to improve the model's perseverance, and the Adam optimizer is used for effective training. The study thoroughly assesses the performance of the U-Net architecture utilizing a large sample of preprocessed satellite topographical images. The model excels in semantic segmentation tasks, displaying high-resolution outputs, quick feature extraction, and flexibility to a wide range of applications. The findings highlight the U-Net architecture's substantial contribution to the advancement of machine learning and image processing technologies. The U-Net approach, which emphasizes pixel-wise categorization and comprehensive segmentation map production, is helpful in practical applications such as autonomous driving, disaster management, and land use planning. This study not only investigates the complexities of U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation, but also highlights its real-world applications in image classification, analysis, and landform identification. The study demonstrates the U-Net model's key significance in influencing the environment of modern technology.</description>

      <title>Robustifying Fourier Features Embeddings for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) employ neural networks to represent continuous functions by mapping coordinates to the corresponding values of the target function, with applications e.g., inverse graphics. However, INRs face a challenge known as spectral bias when dealing with scenes containing varying frequencies. To overcome spectral bias, the most common approach is the Fourier features-based methods such as positional encoding. However, Fourier features-based methods will introduce noise to output, which degrades their performances when applied to downstream tasks. In response, this paper initially hypothesizes that combining multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with Fourier feature embeddings mutually enhances their strengths, yet simultaneously introduces limitations inherent in Fourier feature embeddings. By presenting a simple theorem, we validate our hypothesis, which serves as a foundation for the design of our solution. Leveraging these insights, we propose the use of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) without additive</description>

      <title>A Physical Coherence Benchmark for Evaluating Video Generation Models via Optical Flow-guided Frame Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models demonstrate their potential as world simulators, but they often struggle with videos deviating from physical laws, a key concern overlooked by most text-to-video benchmarks. We introduce a benchmark designed specifically to assess the Physical Coherence of generated videos, PhyCoBench. Our benchmark includes 120 prompts covering 7 categories of physical principles, capturing key physical laws observable in video content. We evaluated four state-of-the-art (SoTA) T2V models on PhyCoBench and conducted manual assessments. Additionally, we propose an automated evaluation model: PhyCoPredictor, a diffusion model that generates optical flow and video frames in a cascade manner. Through a consistency evaluation comparing automated and manual sorting, the experimental results show that PhyCoPredictor currently aligns most closely with human evaluation. Therefore, it can effectively evaluate the physical coherence of videos, providing insights for future model optimization. Our benchmark, which includes physical coherence prompts, automatic evaluation tool PhyCoPredictor, and generated video dataset, will all be released on GitHub shortly.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Vision Transformers for Multimodal Image Classification: A Case Study on Brain, Lung, and Kidney Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have become the standard technique for medical diagnostics, especially in cancer detection and classification. This work evaluates the performance of Vision Transformers architectures, including Swin Transformer and MaxViT, in several datasets of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. We used three training sets of images with brain, lung, and kidney tumors. Each dataset includes different classification labels, from brain gliomas and meningiomas to benign and malignant lung conditions and kidney anomalies such as cysts and cancers. This work aims to analyze the behavior of the neural networks in each dataset and the benefits of combining different image modalities and tumor classes. We designed several experiments by fine-tuning the models on combined and individual image modalities. The results revealed that the Swin Transformer provided high accuracy, achieving up to 99.9\% for kidney tumor classification and 99.3\% accuracy in a combined dataset. MaxViT also provided excellent results in individual datasets but performed poorly when data is combined. This research highlights the adaptability of Transformer-based models to various image modalities and features. However, challenges persist, including limited annotated data and interpretability issues. Future works will expand this study by incorporating other image modalities and enhancing diagnostic capabilities. Integrating these models across diverse datasets could mark a pivotal advance in precision medicine, paving the way for more efficient and comprehensive healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>Fg-T2M++: LLMs-Augmented Fine-Grained Text Driven Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenging problem of fine-grained text-driven human motion generation. Existing works generate imprecise motions that fail to accurately capture relationships specified in text due to: (1) lack of effective text parsing for detailed semantic cues regarding body parts, (2) not fully modeling linguistic structures between words to comprehend text comprehensively. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel fine-grained framework Fg-T2M++ that consists of: (1) an LLMs semantic parsing module to extract body part descriptions and semantics from text, (2) a hyperbolic text representation module to encode relational information between text units by embedding the syntactic dependency graph into hyperbolic space, and (3) a multi-modal fusion module to hierarchically fuse text and motion features. Extensive experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that Fg-T2M++ outperforms SOTA methods, validating its ability to accurately generate motions adhering to comprehensive text semantics.</description>

      <title>SSH: Sparse Spectrum Adaptation via Discrete Hartley Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been demonstrated effective in reducing the trainable parameter number when fine-tuning a large foundation model (LLM). However, it still encounters computational and memory challenges when scaling to larger models or addressing more complex task adaptation.
  In this work, we introduce Sparse Spectrum Adaptation via Discrete Hartley Transformation (SSH), a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while enhancing model performance. It selects the most informative spectral components across all layers, under the guidance of the initial weights after a discrete Hartley transformation (DHT). The lightweight inverse DHT then projects the spectrum back into the spatial domain for updates.
  Extensive experiments across both single-modality tasks such as language understanding and generation and multi-modality tasks such as video-text understanding demonstrate that SSH outperforms existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods while achieving substantial reductions in computational cost and memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Catastrophic Forgetting in Two-Stage Incremental Object Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a critical chanllenge for incremental object detection (IOD). Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically, relying on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing component-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a key insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predominantly localized to the RoI Head classifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This finding challenges conventional assumptions, motivating us to develop a framework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Replay (RePRE) mitigates classifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse prototypes represent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained prototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Projection (NSGP) is further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating the feature extractor in directions orthogonal to subspace of old inputs via gradient projection, aligning RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our simple yet effective design allows NSGP-RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings. Our work not only advances IOD methodology but also provide pivotal insights for catastrophic forgetting mitigation in IOD. Code will be available soon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four-dimensional (4D) Radar-based point cloud generation, clutter removal is commonly performed using the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm. However, CFAR may not fully capture the spatial characteristics of objects. To address limitation, this paper proposes the 4D Radar Point-to-Tensor (4DR P2T) model, which generates tensor data suitable for deep learning applications while minimizing measurement loss. Our method employs a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), modified to effectively process 4D Radar point cloud data and generate tensor data. Experimental results on the K-Radar dataset validate the effectiveness of the 4DR P2T model, achieving an average PSNR of 30.39dB and SSIM of 0.96. Additionally, our analysis of different point cloud generation methods highlights that the 5% percentile method provides the best overall performance, while the 1% percentile method optimally balances data volume reduction and performance, making it well-suited for deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning Through Adaptively Pretrained Visual Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can successfully learn to handle complex tasks, effectively generalizing acquired skills to unfamiliar settings remains a challenge. One of the reasons behind this is the visual encoders used are task-dependent, preventing effective feature extraction in different settings. To address this issue, recent studies have tried to pretrain encoders with diverse visual inputs in order to improve their performance. However, they rely on existing pretrained encoders without further exploring the impact of pretraining period. In this work, we propose APE: efficient reinforcement learning through Adaptively Pretrained visual Encoder -- a framework that utilizes adaptive augmentation strategy during the pretraining phase and extracts generalizable features with only a few interactions within the task environments in the policy learning period. Experiments are conducted across various domains, including DeepMind Control Suite, Atari Games and Memory Maze benchmarks, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Results show that mainstream RL methods, such as DreamerV3 and DrQ-v2, achieve state-of-the-art performance when equipped with APE. In addition, APE significantly improves the sampling efficiency using only visual inputs during learning, approaching the efficiency of state-based method in several control tasks. These findings demonstrate the potential of adaptive pretraining of encoder in enhancing the generalization ability and efficiency of visual RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>MMHMER:Multi-viewer and Multi-task for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (HMER) methods have made remarkable progress, with most existing HMER approaches based on either a hybrid CNN/RNN-based with GRU architecture or Transformer architectures. Each of these has its strengths and weaknesses. Leveraging different model structures as viewers and effectively integrating their diverse capabilities presents an intriguing avenue for exploration. This involves addressing two key challenges: 1) How to fuse these two methods effectively, and 2) How to achieve higher performance under an appropriate level of complexity. This paper proposes an efficient CNN-Transformer multi-viewer, multi-task approach to enhance the model's recognition performance. Our MMHMER model achieves 63.96%, 62.51%, and 65.46% ExpRate on CROHME14, CROHME16, and CROHME19, outperforming Posformer with an absolute gain of 1.28%, 1.48%, and 0.58%. The main contribution of our approach is that we propose a new multi-view, multi-task framework that can effectively integrate the strengths of CNN and Transformer. By leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the sequence modeling capabilities of Transformer, our model can better handle the complexity of handwritten mathematical expressions.</description>

      <title>Event Stream-based Visual Object Tracking: HDETrack V2 and A High-Definition Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We then introduce a novel hierarchical knowledge distillation strategy that incorporates the similarity matrix, feature representation, and response map-based distillation to guide the learning of the student Transformer network. We also enhance the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies by applying the temporal Fourier transform to establish temporal relationships between video frames. We adapt the network model to specific target objects during testing via a newly proposed test-time tuning strategy to achieve high performance and flexibility in target tracking. Recognizing the limitations of existing event-based tracking datasets, which are predominantly low-resolution, we propose EventVOT, the first large-scale high-resolution event-based tracking dataset. It comprises 1141 videos spanning diverse categories such as pedestrians, vehicles, UAVs, ping pong, etc. Extensive experiments on both low-resolution (FE240hz, VisEvent, FELT), and our newly proposed high-resolution EventVOT dataset fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed method. Both the benchmark dataset and source code have been released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EventVOT_Benchmark</description>

      <title>Semantic Data Augmentation Enhanced Invariant Risk Minimization for Medical Image Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image classification. However, its clinical application is often hindered by data heterogeneity caused by variations in scanner vendors, imaging protocols, and operators. Approaches such as invariant risk minimization (IRM) aim to address this challenge of out-of-distribution generalization. For instance, VIRM improves upon IRM by tackling the issue of insufficient feature support overlap, demonstrating promising potential. Nonetheless, these methods face limitations in medical imaging due to the scarcity of annotated data and the inefficiency of augmentation strategies. To address these issues, we propose a novel domain-oriented direction selector to replace the random augmentation strategy used in VIRM. Our method leverages inter-domain covariance as a guider for augmentation direction, guiding data augmentation towards the target domain. This approach effectively reduces domain discrepancies and enhances generalization performance. Experiments on a multi-center diabetic retinopathy dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly under limited data conditions and significant domain heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>FreeBlend: Advancing Concept Blending with Staged Feedback-Driven Interpolation Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept blending is a promising yet underexplored area in generative models. While recent approaches, such as embedding mixing and latent modification based on structural sketches, have been proposed, they often suffer from incompatible semantic information and discrepancies in shape and appearance. In this work, we introduce FreeBlend, an effective, training-free framework designed to address these challenges. To mitigate cross-modal loss and enhance feature detail, we leverage transferred image embeddings as conditional inputs. The framework employs a stepwise increasing interpolation strategy between latents, progressively adjusting the blending ratio to seamlessly integrate auxiliary features. Additionally, we introduce a feedback-driven mechanism that updates the auxiliary latents in reverse order, facilitating global blending and preventing rigid or unnatural outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the semantic coherence and visual quality of blended images, yielding compelling and coherent results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fusion is one of the most promising ways for humans to obtain infinite energy. Currently, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the mission of nuclear fusion has also entered a critical period of its development. How to let more people to understand nuclear fusion and join in its research is one of the effective means to accelerate the implementation of fusion. This paper proposes the first large model in the field of nuclear fusion, XiHeFusion, which is obtained through supervised fine-tuning based on the open-source large model Qwen2.5-14B. We have collected multi-source knowledge about nuclear fusion tasks to support the training of this model, including the common crawl, eBooks, arXiv, dissertation, etc. After the model has mastered the knowledge of the nuclear fusion field, we further used the chain of thought to enhance its logical reasoning ability, making XiHeFusion able to provide more accurate and logical answers. In addition, we propose a test questionnaire containing 180+ questions to assess the conversational ability of this science popularization large model. Extensive experimental results show that our nuclear fusion dialogue model, XiHeFusion, can perform well in answering science popularization knowledge. The pre-trained XiHeFusion model is released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/XiHeFusion.</description>

      <title>An inpainting approach to manipulate asymmetry in pre-operative breast images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most frequent modalities of breast cancer treatment is surgery. Breast surgery can cause visual alterations to the breasts, due to scars and asymmetries. To enable an informed choice of treatment, the patient must be adequately informed of the aesthetic outcomes of each treatment plan. In this work, we propose an inpainting approach to manipulate breast shape and nipple position in breast images, for the purpose of predicting the aesthetic outcomes of breast cancer treatment. We perform experiments with various model architectures for the inpainting task, including invertible networks capable of manipulating breasts in the absence of ground-truth breast contour and nipple annotations. Experiments on two breast datasets show the proposed models' ability to realistically alter a patient's breasts, enabling a faithful reproduction of breast asymmetries of post-operative patients in pre-operative images.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved unprecedented success in several objective multimodal reasoning tasks. However, to further enhance their capabilities of empathetic and effective communication with humans, improving how VLMs process and understand emotions is crucial. Despite significant research attention on improving affective understanding, there is a lack of detailed evaluations of VLMs for emotion-related tasks, which can potentially help inform downstream fine-tuning efforts. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of VLMs for recognizing evoked emotions from images. We create a benchmark for the task of evoked emotion recognition and study the performance of VLMs for this task, from perspectives of correctness and robustness. Through several experiments, we demonstrate important factors that emotion recognition performance depends on, and also characterize the various errors made by VLMs in the process. Finally, we pinpoint potential causes for errors through a human evaluation study. We use our experimental results to inform recommendations for the future of emotion research in the context of VLMs.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their performance and simplicity, rigid body simulators are often used in applications where the objects of interest can considered very stiff. However, no material has infinite stiffness, which means there are potentially cases where the non-zero compliance of the seemingly rigid object can cause a significant difference between its trajectories when simulated in a rigid body or deformable simulator.
  Similarly to how adversarial attacks are developed against image classifiers, we propose an adversarial attack against rigid body simulators. In this adversarial attack, we solve an optimization problem to construct perceptually rigid adversarial objects that have the same collision geometry and moments of mass to a reference object, so that they behave identically in rigid body simulations but maximally different in more accurate deformable simulations. We demonstrate the validity of our method by comparing simulations of several examples in commercially available simulators.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Dataset Distillation: Toward Scalable and Generalizable Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation, which condenses large-scale datasets into compact synthetic representations, has emerged as a critical solution for training modern deep learning models efficiently. While prior surveys focus on developments before 2023, this work comprehensively reviews recent advances, emphasizing scalability to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. We categorize progress into a few key methodologies: trajectory matching, gradient matching, distribution matching, scalable generative approaches, and decoupling optimization mechanisms. As a comprehensive examination of recent dataset distillation advances, this survey highlights breakthrough innovations: the SRe2L framework for efficient and effective condensation, soft label strategies that significantly enhance model accuracy, and lossless distillation techniques that maximize compression while maintaining performance. Beyond these methodological advancements, we address critical challenges, including robustness against adversarial and backdoor attacks, effective handling of non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we explore emerging applications in video and audio processing, multi-modal learning, medical imaging, and scientific computing, highlighting its domain versatility. By offering extensive performance comparisons and actionable research directions, this survey equips researchers and practitioners with practical insights to advance efficient and generalizable dataset distillation, paving the way for future innovations.</description>

      <title>SSDD-GAN: Single-Step Denoising Diffusion GAN for Cochlear Implant Surgical Scene Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image completion methods, including both inpainting and outpainting, have demonstrated promising results in restoring corrupted images by effectively filling various missing regions. Among these, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been employed as key generative image completion approaches, excelling in the field of generating high-quality restorations with reduced artifacts and improved fine details. In previous work, we developed a method aimed at synthesizing views from novel microscope positions for mastoidectomy surgeries; however, that approach did not have the ability to restore the surrounding surgical scene environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to complete the surgical scene of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning on real surgical datasets to train a Single-Step Denoising Diffusion-GAN (SSDD-GAN), combining the advantages of diffusion models with the adversarial optimization of GANs for improved Structural Similarity results of 6%. The trained model is then directly applied to the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset using a zero-shot approach, enabling the generation of realistic and complete surgical scenes without the need for explicit ground-truth labels from the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset. This method addresses key limitations in previous work, offering a novel pathway for full surgical microscopy scene completion and enhancing the usability of the synthetic postmastoidectomy dataset in surgical preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world applications where computational resources are limited, effectively integrating visual and textual information for Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents significant challenges. This paper investigates the performance of traditional models under computational constraints, focusing on enhancing VQA performance, particularly for numerical and counting questions. We evaluate models based on Bidirectional GRU (BidGRU), GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BidLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), analyzing the impact of different vocabulary sizes, fine-tuning strategies, and embedding dimensions. Experimental results show that the BidGRU model with an embedding dimension of 300 and a vocabulary size of 3000 achieves the best overall performance without the computational overhead of larger models. Ablation studies emphasize the importance of attention mechanisms and counting information in handling complex reasoning tasks under resource limitations. Our research provides valuable insights for developing more efficient VQA models suitable for deployment in environments with limited computational capacity.</description>

      <title>Linear Attention Modeling for Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years, learned image compression has made tremendous progress to achieve impressive coding efficiency. Its coding gain mainly comes from non-linear neural network-based transform and learnable entropy modeling. However, most of recent focuses have been solely on a strong backbone, and few studies consider the low-complexity design. In this paper, we propose LALIC, a linear attention modeling for learned image compression. Specially, we propose to use Bi-RWKV blocks, by utilizing the Spatial Mix and Channel Mix modules to achieve more compact features extraction, and apply the Conv based Omni-Shift module to adapt to two-dimensional latent representation. Furthermore, we propose a RWKV-based Spatial-Channel ConTeXt model (RWKV-SCCTX), that leverages the Bi-RWKV to modeling the correlation between neighboring features effectively, to further improve the RD performance. To our knowledge, our work is the first work to utilize efficient Bi-RWKV models with linear attention for learned image compression. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive RD performances by outperforming VTM-9.1 by -14.84%, -15.20%, -17.32% in BD-rate on Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional validation datasets.</description>

      <title>UniDB: A Unified Diffusion Bridge Framework via Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion bridge models leverage Doob's $h$-transform to establish fixed endpoints between distributions, demonstrating promising results in image translation and restoration tasks. However, these approaches frequently produce blurred or excessively smoothed image details and lack a comprehensive theoretical foundation to explain these shortcomings. To address these limitations, we propose UniDB, a unified framework for diffusion bridges based on Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC). UniDB formulates the problem through an SOC-based optimization and derives a closed-form solution for the optimal controller, thereby unifying and generalizing existing diffusion bridge models. We demonstrate that existing diffusion bridges employing Doob's $h$-transform constitute a special case of our framework, emerging when the terminal penalty coefficient in the SOC cost function tends to infinity. By incorporating a tunable terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves an optimal balance between control costs and terminal penalties, substantially improving detail preservation and output quality. Notably, UniDB seamlessly integrates with existing diffusion bridge models, requiring only minimal code modifications. Extensive experiments across diverse image restoration tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of the proposed framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/UniDB-SOC/UniDB/.</description>

      <title>Exploring Visual Embedding Spaces Induced by Vision Transformers for Online Auto Parts Marketplaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the capabilities of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model in generating visual embeddings for images of auto parts sourced from online marketplaces, such as Craigslist and OfferUp. By focusing exclusively on single-modality data, the analysis evaluates ViT's potential for detecting patterns indicative of illicit activities. The workflow involves extracting high-dimensional embeddings from images, applying dimensionality reduction techniques like Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize the embedding space, and using K-Means clustering to categorize similar items. Representative posts nearest to each cluster centroid provide insights into the composition and characteristics of the clusters. While the results highlight the strengths of ViT in isolating visual patterns, challenges such as overlapping clusters and outliers underscore the limitations of single-modal approaches in this domain. This work contributes to understanding the role of Vision Transformers in analyzing online marketplaces and offers a foundation for future advancements in detecting fraudulent or illegal activities.</description>

      <title>3CAD: A Large-Scale Real-World 3C Product Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection achieves progress thanks to datasets such as MVTec-AD and VisA. However, they suf- fer from limitations in terms of the number of defect sam- ples, types of defects, and availability of real-world scenes. These constraints inhibit researchers from further exploring the performance of industrial detection with higher accuracy. To this end, we propose a new large-scale anomaly detection dataset called 3CAD, which is derived from real 3C produc- tion lines. Specifically, the proposed 3CAD includes eight different types of manufactured parts, totaling 27,039 high- resolution images labeled with pixel-level anomalies. The key features of 3CAD are that it covers anomalous regions of different sizes, multiple anomaly types, and the possibility of multiple anomalous regions and multiple anomaly types per anomaly image. This is the largest and first anomaly de- tection dataset dedicated to 3C product quality control for community exploration and development. Meanwhile, we in- troduce a simple yet effective framework for unsupervised anomaly detection: a Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance (CFRG). To detect small defect anoma- lies, the proposed CFRG utilizes a coarse-to-fine detection paradigm. Specifically, we utilize a heterogeneous distilla- tion model for coarse localization and then fine localiza- tion through a segmentation model. In addition, to better capture normal patterns, we introduce recovery features as guidance. Finally, we report the results of our CFRG frame- work and popular anomaly detection methods on the 3CAD dataset, demonstrating strong competitiveness and providing a highly challenging benchmark to promote the development of the anomaly detection field.

      <title>Effective Black-Box Multi-Faceted Attacks Breach Vision Large Language Model Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrate visual data processing, expanding their real-world applications, but also increasing the risk of generating unsafe responses. In response, leading companies have implemented Multi-Layered safety defenses, including alignment training, safety system prompts, and content moderation. However, their effectiveness against sophisticated adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose MultiFaceted Attack, a novel attack framework designed to systematically bypass Multi-Layered Defenses in VLLMs. It comprises three complementary attack facets: Visual Attack that exploits the multimodal nature of VLLMs to inject toxic system prompts through images; Alignment Breaking Attack that manipulates the model's alignment mechanism to prioritize the generation of contrasting responses; and Adversarial Signature that deceives content moderators by strategically placing misleading information at the end of the response. Extensive evaluations on eight commercial VLLMs in a black-box setting demonstrate that MultiFaceted Attack achieves a 61.56% attack success rate, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by at least 42.18%.</description>

      <title>A 3D Multimodal Feature for Infrastructure Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ageing structures require periodic inspections to identify structural defects. Previous work has used geometric distortions to locate cracks in synthetic masonry bridge point clouds but has struggled to detect small cracks. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel 3D multimodal feature, 3DMulti-FPFHI, that combines a customized Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) with an intensity feature. This feature is integrated into the PatchCore anomaly detection algorithm and evaluated through statistical and parametric analyses. The method is further evaluated using point clouds of a real masonry arch bridge and a full-scale experimental model of a concrete tunnel. Results show that the 3D intensity feature enhances inspection quality by improving crack detection; it also enables the identification of water ingress which introduces intensity anomalies. The 3DMulti-FPFHI outperforms FPFH and a state-of-the-art multimodal anomaly detection method. The potential of the method to address diverse infrastructure anomaly detection scenarios is highlighted by the minimal requirements for data compared to learning-based methods. The code and related point cloud dataset are available at https://github.com/Jingyixiong/3D-Multi-FPFHI.</description>

      <title>MicroViT: A Vision Transformer with Low Complexity Self Attention for Edge Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, but its high computational demands make it impractical for edge devices with limited resources. This paper presents MicroViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer architecture optimized for edge devices by significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. The core of MicroViT is the Efficient Single Head Attention (ESHA) mechanism, which utilizes group convolution to reduce feature redundancy and processes only a fraction of the channels, thus lowering the burden of the self-attention mechanism. MicroViT is designed using a multi-stage MetaFormer architecture, stacking multiple MicroViT encoders to enhance efficiency and performance. Comprehensive experiments on the ImageNet-1K and COCO datasets demonstrate that MicroViT achieves competitive accuracy while significantly improving 3.6 faster inference speed and reducing energy consumption with 40% higher efficiency than the MobileViT series, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile and edge devices.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer: Tree-structured Strategy with Answer Distribution Estimator for Goal-Oriented Visual Dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal-oriented visual dialogue involves multi-round interaction between artificial agents, which has been of remarkable attention due to its wide applications. Given a visual scene, this task occurs when a Questioner asks an action-oriented question and an Answerer responds with the intent of letting the Questioner know the correct action to take. The quality of questions affects the accuracy and efficiency of the target search progress. However, existing methods lack a clear strategy to guide the generation of questions, resulting in the randomness in the search process and inconvergent results. We propose a Tree-Structured Strategy with Answer Distribution Estimator (TSADE) which guides the question generation by excluding half of the current candidate objects in each round. The above process is implemented by maximizing a binary reward inspired by the ``divide-and-conquer'' paradigm. We further design a candidate-minimization reward which encourages the model to narrow down the scope of candidate objects toward the end of the dialogue. We experimentally demonstrate that our method can enable the agents to achieve high task-oriented accuracy with fewer repeating questions and rounds compared to traditional ergodic question generation approaches. Qualitative results further show that TSADE facilitates agents to generate higher-quality questions.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation Distillation via Multi-Scale Feature Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of a smaller student network without increasing its parameter size by transferring knowledge from a larger, pre-trained teacher network. Previous approaches have predominantly focused on distilling global feature information while overlooking the importance of disentangling the diverse types of information embedded within different regions of the feature. In this work, we introduce multi-scale decoupling in the feature transfer process for the first time, where the decoupled local features are individually processed and integrated with contrastive learning. Moreover, compared to previous contrastive learning-based distillation methods, our approach not only reduces computational costs but also enhances efficiency, enabling performance improvements for the student network using only single-batch samples. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet demonstrate our method's superiority, with some student networks distilled using our method even surpassing the performance of their pre-trained teacher networks. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in enabling student networks to thoroughly absorb knowledge from teacher networks.</description>

      <title>Training-free Anomaly Event Detection via LLM-guided Symbolic Pattern Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly event detection plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. However, current approaches predominantly rely on supervised learning, which faces significant challenges: the requirement for extensive labeled training data and lack of interpretability in decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we present a training-free framework that integrates open-set object detection with symbolic regression, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient symbolic pattern discovery. The LLMs guide the symbolic reasoning process, establishing logical relationships between detected entities. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains, our framework demonstrates several key advantages: (1) achieving superior detection accuracy through direct reasoning without any training process; (2) providing highly interpretable logical expressions that are readily comprehensible to humans; and (3) requiring minimal annotation effort - approximately 1% of the data needed by traditional training-based methods.To facilitate comprehensive evaluation and future research, we introduce two datasets: a large-scale private dataset containing over 110,000 annotated images covering various anomaly scenarios including construction site safety violations, illegal fishing activities, and industrial hazards, along with a public benchmark dataset of 5,000 samples with detailed anomaly event annotations. Code is available at here.</description>

      <title>Acquisition through My Eyes and Steps: A Joint Predictive Agent Model in Egocentric Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the task of learning an agent model behaving like humans, which can jointly perceive, predict, and act in egocentric worlds. Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, leading to information silos among them, which prevents these abilities from learning from each other and collaborating effectively. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions with a single transformer. EgoAgent unifies the representational spaces of the three abilities by mapping them all into a sequence of continuous tokens. Learnable query tokens are appended to obtain current states, future states, and next actions. With joint supervision, our agent model establishes the internal relationship among these three abilities and effectively mimics the human inference and learning processes. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent covering image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>SphereFusion: Efficient Panorama Depth Estimation via Gated Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the rapid development of panorama cameras, the task of estimating panorama depth has attracted significant attention from the computer vision community, especially in applications such as robot sensing and autonomous driving. However, existing methods relying on different projection formats often encounter challenges, either struggling with distortion and discontinuity in the case of equirectangular, cubemap, and tangent projections, or experiencing a loss of texture details with the spherical projection. To tackle these concerns, we present SphereFusion, an end-to-end framework that combines the strengths of various projection methods. Specifically, SphereFusion initially employs 2D image convolution and mesh operations to extract two distinct types of features from the panorama image in both equirectangular and spherical projection domains. These features are then projected onto the spherical domain, where a gate fusion module selects the most reliable features for fusion. Finally, SphereFusion estimates panorama depth within the spherical domain. Meanwhile, SphereFusion employs a cache strategy to improve the efficiency of mesh operation. Extensive experiments on three public panorama datasets demonstrate that SphereFusion achieves competitive results with other state-of-the-art methods, while presenting the fastest inference speed at only 17 ms on a 512$\times$1024 panorama image.</description>

      <title>HyLiFormer: Hyperbolic Linear Attention for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in skeleton-based human action recognition, yet their quadratic computational complexity remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. To mitigate this, linear attention mechanisms have been explored but struggle to capture the hierarchical structure of skeleton data. Meanwhile, the Poincar\'e model, as a typical hyperbolic geometry, offers a powerful framework for modeling hierarchical structures but lacks well-defined operations for existing mainstream linear attention. In this paper, we propose HyLiFormer, a novel hyperbolic linear attention Transformer tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. Our approach incorporates a Hyperbolic Transformation with Curvatures (HTC) module to map skeleton data into hyperbolic space and a Hyperbolic Linear Attention (HLA) module for efficient long-range dependency modeling. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that HyLiFormer significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving model accuracy, making it a promising solution for efficiency-critical applications.</description>

      <title>MMGDreamer: Mixed-Modality Graph for Geometry-Controllable 3D Indoor Scene Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable 3D scene generation has extensive applications in virtual reality and interior design, where the generated scenes should exhibit high levels of realism and controllability in terms of geometry. Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

      <title>Beyond Fine-Tuning: A Systematic Study of Sampling Techniques in Personalized Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to create images tailored to user-defined concepts and textual descriptions. Balancing the fidelity of the learned concept with its ability for generation in various contexts presents a significant challenge. Existing methods often address this through diverse fine-tuning parameterizations and improved sampling strategies that integrate superclass trajectories during the diffusion process. While improved sampling offers a cost-effective, training-free solution for enhancing fine-tuned models, systematic analyses of these methods remain limited. Current approaches typically tie sampling strategies with fixed fine-tuning configurations, making it difficult to isolate their impact on generation outcomes. To address this issue, we systematically analyze sampling strategies beyond fine-tuning, exploring the impact of concept and superclass trajectories on the results. Building on this analysis, we propose a decision framework evaluating text alignment, computational constraints, and fidelity objectives to guide strategy selection. It integrates with diverse architectures and training approaches, systematically optimizing concept preservation, prompt adherence, and resource efficiency.

      <title>Fast Omni-Directional Image Super-Resolution: Adapting the Implicit Image Function with Pixel and Semantic-Wise Spherical Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Omni-Directional Image (ODI) Super-Resolution (SR), the unique challenge arises from the non-uniform oversampling characteristics caused by EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). Considerable efforts in designing complex spherical convolutions or polyhedron reprojection offer significant performance improvements but at the expense of cumbersome processing procedures and slower inference speeds. Under these circumstances, this paper proposes a new ODI-SR model characterized by its capacity to perform Fast and Arbitrary-scale ODI-SR processes, denoted as FAOR. The key innovation lies in adapting the implicit image function from the planar image domain to the ERP image domain by incorporating spherical geometric priors at both the latent representation and image reconstruction stages, in a low-overhead manner. Specifically, at the latent representation stage, we adopt a pair of pixel-wise and semantic-wise sphere-to-planar distortion maps to perform affine transformations on the latent representation, thereby incorporating it with spherical properties. Moreover, during the image reconstruction stage, we introduce a geodesic-based resampling strategy, aligning the implicit image function with spherical geometrics without introducing additional parameters. As a result, the proposed FAOR outperforms the state-of-the-art ODI-SR models with a much faster inference speed. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of our design.</description>

      <title>QP-SNN: Quantized and Pruned Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) leverage sparse spikes to encode information and operate in an asynchronous event-driven manner, offering a highly energy-efficient paradigm for machine intelligence. However, the current SNN community focuses primarily on performance improvement by developing large-scale models, which limits the applicability of SNNs in resource-limited edge devices. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly and lightweight SNN, aimed at effectively deploying high-performance SNN in resource-limited scenarios. Specifically, we first develop a baseline model that integrates uniform quantization and structured pruning, called QP-SNN baseline. While this baseline significantly reduces storage demands and computational costs, it suffers from performance decline. To address this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in quantization and pruning that lead to performance degradation and propose solutions to enhance the baseline's performance. For weight quantization, we propose a weight rescaling strategy that utilizes bit width more effectively to enhance the model's representation capability. For structured pruning, we propose a novel pruning criterion using the singular value of spatiotemporal spike activities to enable more accurate removal of redundant kernels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating two proposed methods into the baseline allows QP-SNN to achieve state-of-the-art performance and efficiency, underscoring its potential for enhancing SNN deployment in edge intelligence computing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Collaborative Learning Network for Video Quality Assessment in Industrial Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Quality Assessment (VQA) is vital for large-scale video retrieval systems, aimed at identifying quality issues to prioritize high-quality videos. In industrial systems, low-quality video characteristics fall into four categories: visual-related issues like mosaics and black boxes, textual issues from video titles and OCR content, and semantic issues like frame incoherence and frame-text mismatch from AI-generated videos. Despite their prevalence in industrial settings, these low-quality videos have been largely overlooked in academic research, posing a challenge for accurate identification. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Branch Collaborative Network (MBCN) tailored for industrial video retrieval systems. MBCN features four branches, each designed to tackle one of the aforementioned quality issues. After each branch independently scores videos, we aggregate these scores using a weighted approach and a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism to dynamically address quality issues across different scenarios. We implement point-wise and pair-wise optimization objectives to ensure score stability and reasonableness. Extensive offline and online experiments on a world-level video search engine demonstrate MBCN's effectiveness in identifying video quality issues, significantly enhancing the retrieval system's ranking performance. Detailed experimental analyses confirm the positive contribution of all four evaluation branches. Furthermore, MBCN significantly improves recognition accuracy for low-quality AI-generated videos compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>ClinKD: Cross-Modal Clinic Knowledge Distiller For Multi-Task Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Med-VQA (Medical Visual Question Answering) is a crucial subtask within the broader VQA (Visual Question Answering) domain. This task requires a visual question answering system to analyze the provided image and corresponding question,offering reasonable analysis and suggestions to assist medical professionals in making pathological diagnoses, or ideally, enabling the system to independently provide correct diagnoses. Furthermore, more advanced Med-VQA tasks involve Referring and Grounding, which not only require the system to accurately comprehend medical images but also to pinpoint specific biological locations within those images. While many large pre-trained models have demonstrated substantial VQA capabilities,challenges persist in the medical imaging domain. The intricacy of biological features in medical images and the scarcity of high-quality medical image datasets, combined with the fact that current models are not tailored for the medical field in terms of architecture and training paradigms, hinder the full exploitation of model generalization. This results in issues such as hallucination in Visual Grounding. In this paper, we introduce the ClinKD model, which incorporates modifications to model position encoding and a diversified training process. Initially, we enhance the model's ability to perceive image and modality variations by using Med-CLIP Guided Rotary Position Embedding. Subsequently, we leverage distillation to provide prior knowledge to the model before using complete training data. Additionally, the feedback-based training process during the formal training phase further enhances data utilization. Notably, under unchanged evaluation protocols, we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the Med-GRIT-270k dataset, and the Med-CLIP Guided Rotary Position Embedding approach presents potential for generalizing to universal model position encoding.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Multiple Heads Decoding for LLM via Dynamic Tree Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple heads decoding accelerates the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by predicting next several tokens simultaneously. It generates and verifies multiple candidate sequences in parallel via tree attention with a fixed structure. In this paper, we replace the fixed tree attention with dynamic tree attention on multiple head decoding, specifically in the context of MEDUSA. We propose a simple and low complexity strategy to generate candidates and construct the dynamic tree structure. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method improves the decoding efficiency of multiple head decoding for LLMs while maintaining the generation quality. This result demonstrates the potential for improvement of multiple head decoding in candidate generation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gradient-based Uncertainty for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation, similar to other image-based tasks, is prone to erroneous predictions due to ambiguities in the image, for example, caused by dynamic objects or shadows. For this reason, pixel-wise uncertainty assessment is required for safety-critical applications to highlight the areas where the prediction is unreliable. We address this in a post hoc manner and introduce gradient-based uncertainty estimation for already trained depth estimation models. To extract gradients without depending on the ground truth depth, we introduce an auxiliary loss function based on the consistency of the predicted depth and a reference depth. The reference depth, which acts as pseudo ground truth, is in fact generated using a simple image or feature augmentation, making our approach simple and effective. To obtain the final uncertainty score, the derivatives w.r.t. the feature maps from single or multiple layers are calculated using back-propagation. We demonstrate that our gradient-based approach is effective in determining the uncertainty without re-training using the two standard depth estimation benchmarks KITTI and NYU. In particular, for models trained with monocular sequences and therefore most prone to uncertainty, our method outperforms related approaches. In addition, we publicly provide our code and models: https://github.com/jhornauer/GrUMoDepth</description>

      <title>VFX Creator: Animated Visual Effect Generation with Controllable Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crafting magic and illusions is one of the most thrilling aspects of filmmaking, with visual effects (VFX) serving as the powerhouse behind unforgettable cinematic experiences. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have driven progress in generic image and video synthesis, the domain of controllable VFX generation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for animated VFX generation as image animation, where dynamic effects are generated from user-friendly textual descriptions and static reference images.
  Our work makes two primary contributions: (i) Open-VFX, the first high-quality VFX video dataset spanning 15 diverse effect categories, annotated with textual descriptions, instance segmentation masks for spatial conditioning, and start-end timestamps for temporal control. (ii) VFX Creator, a simple yet effective controllable VFX generation framework based on a Video Diffusion Transformer. The model incorporates a spatial and temporal controllable LoRA adapter, requiring minimal training videos. Specifically, a plug-and-play mask control module enables instance-level spatial manipulation, while tokenized start-end motion timestamps embedded in the diffusion process, alongside the text encoder, allow precise temporal control over effect timing and pace.
  Extensive experiments on the Open-VFX test set demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in generating realistic and dynamic effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance and generalization ability in both spatial and temporal controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a specialized metric to evaluate the precision of temporal control. By bridging traditional VFX techniques with generative approaches, VFX Creator unlocks new possibilities for efficient and high-quality video effect generation, making advanced VFX accessible to a broader audience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issues of slow detection speed,low accuracy,difficulty in deployment on industrial edge devices,and large parameter and computational requirements in deep learning-based coal gangue target detection methods,we propose a lightweight coal gangue target detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv11.First,we use the lightweight network ShuffleNetV2 as the backbone to enhance detection speed.Second,we introduce a lightweight downsampling operation,ADown,which reduces model complexity while improving average detection accuracy.Third,we improve the C2PSA module in YOLOv11 by incorporating the Triplet Attention mechanism,resulting in the proposed C2PSA-TriAtt module,which enhances the model's ability to focus on different dimensions of images.Fourth,we propose the Inner-FocalerIoU loss function to replace the existing CIoU loss function.Experimental results show that our model achieves a detection accuracy of 99.10% in coal gangue detection tasks,reduces the model size by 38%,the number of parameters by 41%,and the computational cost by 40%,while decreasing the average detection time per image by 1 ms.The improved model demonstrates enhanced detection speed and accuracy,making it suitable for deployment on industrial edge mobile devices,thus contributing positively to coal processing and efficient utilization of coal resources.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Image Signal Processing Approaches for Low-Illumination Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usage of digital content (photos and videos) in a variety of applications has increased due to the popularity of multimedia devices. These uses include advertising campaigns, educational resources, and social networking platforms. There is an increasing need for high-quality graphic information as people become more visually focused. However, captured images frequently have poor visibility and a high amount of noise due to the limitations of image-capturing devices and lighting conditions. Improving the visual quality of images taken in low illumination is the aim of low-illumination image enhancement. This problem is addressed by traditional image enhancement techniques, which alter noise, brightness, and contrast. Deep learning-based methods, however, have dominated recently made advances in this area. These methods have effectively reduced noise while preserving important information, showing promising results in the improvement of low-illumination images. An extensive summary of image signal processing methods for enhancing low-illumination images is provided in this paper. Three categories are classified in the review for approaches: hybrid techniques, deep learning-based methods, and traditional approaches. Conventional techniques include denoising, automated white balancing, and noise reduction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in deep learningbased techniques to recognize and extract characteristics from low-light images. To get better results, hybrid approaches combine deep learning-based methodologies with more conventional methods. The review also discusses the advantages and limitations of each approach and provides insights into future research directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Noise is an Efficient Learner for Zero-Shot Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, test-time adaptation has garnered attention as a method for tuning models without labeled data. The conventional modus operandi for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time primarily focuses on tuning learnable prompts; however, this approach overlooks potential distribution shifts in the visual representations themselves. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing Test-Time Noise Tuning (TNT), a novel method for handling unpredictable shifts in the visual space. TNT leverages, for the first time, a noise adaptation strategy that optimizes learnable noise directly in the visual input space, enabling adaptive feature learning from a single test sample. We further introduce a novel approach for inter-view representation alignment by explicitly enforcing coherence in embedding distances, ensuring consistent feature representations across views. Combined with scaled logits and confident view selection at inference, TNT substantially enhances VLM generalization and calibration, achieving average gains of +7.38% on natural distributions benchmark and +0.80% on cross-dataset evaluations over zero-shot CLIP. These improvements lay a strong foundation for adaptive out-of-distribution handling.</description>

      <title>Temporal Working Memory: Query-Guided Segment Refinement for Enhanced Multimodal Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have demonstrated significant success in tasks such as visual captioning, question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, these models face inherent limitations due to their finite internal capacity, which restricts their ability to process extended temporal sequences, a crucial requirement for comprehensive video and audio analysis. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a specialized cognitive module, temporal working memory (TWM), which aims to enhance the temporal modeling capabilities of MFMs. It selectively retains task-relevant information across temporal dimensions, ensuring that critical details are preserved throughout the processing of video and audio content. The TWM uses a query-guided attention approach to focus on the most informative multimodal segments within temporal sequences. By retaining only the most relevant content, TWM optimizes the use of the model's limited capacity, enhancing its temporal modeling ability. This plug-and-play module can be easily integrated into existing MFMs. With our TWM, nine state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance improvements across tasks such as video captioning, question answering, and video-text retrieval. By enhancing temporal modeling, TWM extends the capability of MFMs to handle complex, time-sensitive data effectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/xid32/NAACL_2025_TWM.</description>

      <title>Dual Caption Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in human preference optimization, originally developed for Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in improving text-to-image diffusion models. These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, existing preference datasets often exhibit overlap between these distributions, leading to a conflict distribution. Additionally, we identified that input prompts contain irrelevant information for less preferred images, limiting the denoising network's ability to accurately predict noise in preference optimization methods, known as the irrelevant prompt issue. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a novel approach that utilizes two distinct captions to mitigate irrelevant prompts. To tackle conflict distribution, we introduce the Pick-Double Caption dataset, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for preferred and less preferred images. We further propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.</description>

      <title>DiTASK: Multi-Task Fine-Tuning with Diffeomorphic Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Vision Transformers now serve as powerful tools for computer vision. Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Into Spectral Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traveling waves are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' problem -- which highlights how spectral modes encode geometric information -- we introduce a set of convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli. By applying a spectral decomposition to these wave-like activations, we obtain a powerful new representational space that outperforms equivalently local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism and spectral readouts solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, where local feed-forward models fail. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based representations in artificial networks, our findings suggest potential efficiency benefits and offer a new framework for connecting to biological recordings of neural activity.</description>

      <title>Fair-MoE: Fairness-Oriented Mixture of Experts in Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness is a fundamental principle in medical ethics. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant potential in the medical field due to their ability to leverage both visual and linguistic contexts, reducing the need for large datasets and enabling the performance of complex tasks. However, the exploration of fairness within VLM applications remains limited. Applying VLMs without a comprehensive analysis of fairness could lead to concerns about equal treatment opportunities and diminish public trust in medical deep learning models. To build trust in medical VLMs, we propose Fair-MoE, a model specifically designed to ensure both fairness and effectiveness. Fair-MoE comprises two key components: \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Mixture of Experts (FO-MoE)} and \textit{the Fairness-Oriented Loss (FOL)}. FO-MoE is designed to leverage the expertise of various specialists to filter out biased patch embeddings and use an ensemble approach to extract more equitable information relevant to specific tasks. FOL is a novel fairness-oriented loss function that not only minimizes the distances between different attributes but also optimizes the differences in the dispersion of various attributes' distributions. Extended experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and fairness of Fair-MoE. Tested on the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset, Fair-MoE showed improvements in both fairness and accuracy across all four attributes. Code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Col-OLHTR: A Novel Framework for Multimodal Online Handwritten Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Handwritten Text Recognition (OLHTR) has gained considerable attention for its diverse range of applications. Current approaches usually treat OLHTR as a sequence recognition task, employing either a single trajectory or image encoder, or multi-stream encoders, combined with a CTC or attention-based recognition decoder. However, these approaches face several drawbacks: 1) single encoders typically focus on either local trajectories or visual regions, lacking the ability to dynamically capture relevant global features in challenging cases; 2) multi-stream encoders, while more comprehensive, suffer from complex structures and increased inference costs. To tackle this, we propose a Collaborative learning-based OLHTR framework, called Col-OLHTR, that learns multimodal features during training while maintaining a single-stream inference process. Col-OLHTR consists of a trajectory encoder, a Point-to-Spatial Alignment (P2SA) module, and an attention-based decoder. The P2SA module is designed to learn image-level spatial features through trajectory-encoded features and 2D rotary position embeddings. During training, an additional image-stream encoder-decoder is collaboratively trained to provide supervision for P2SA features. At inference, the extra streams are discarded, and only the P2SA module is used and merged before the decoder, simplifying the process while preserving high performance. Extensive experimental results on several OLHTR benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, proving the effectiveness and robustness of our design.</description>

      <title>A Novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time Object Detection using 4D Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is crucial for safe autonomous navigation, requiring reliable performance across diverse weather conditions. While LiDAR performance deteriorates in challenging weather, Radar systems maintain their reliability. Traditional Radars have limitations due to their lack of elevation data, but the recent 4D Radars overcome this by measuring elevation alongside range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity, making them invaluable for autonomous vehicles. The primary challenge in utilizing 4D Radars is the sparsity of their point clouds. Previous works address this by developing architectures that better capture semantics and context in sparse point cloud, largely drawing from LiDAR-based approaches. However, these methods often overlook a unique advantage of 4D Radars: the dense Radar tensor, which encapsulates power measurements across three spatial dimensions and the Doppler dimension. Our paper leverages this tensor to tackle the sparsity issue. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables a student model to densify its sparse input in the latent space by emulating an ensemble of teacher models. Our experiments demonstrate a 25% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art RTNH model on the K-Radar dataset. Notably, this improvement is achieved while still maintaining a real-time inference speed.</description>

      <title>An Appearance Defect Detection Method for Cigarettes Based on C-CenterNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the poor adaptability of traditional methods in the cigarette detection task on the automatic cigarette production line, it is difficult to accurately identify whether a cigarette has defects and the types of defects; thus, a cigarette appearance defect detection method based on C-CenterNet is proposed. This detector uses keypoint estimation to locate center points and regresses all other defect properties. Firstly, Resnet50 is used as the backbone feature extraction network, and the convolutional block attention mechanism (CBAM) is introduced to enhance the network's ability to extract effective features and reduce the interference of non-target information. At the same time, the feature pyramid network is used to enhance the feature extraction of each layer. Then, deformable convolution is used to replace part of the common convolution to enhance the learning ability of different shape defects. Finally, the activation function ACON (ActivateOrNot) is used instead of the ReLU activation function, and the activation operation of some neurons is adaptively selected to improve the detection accuracy of the network. The experimental results are mainly acquired via the mean Average Precision (mAP). The experimental results show that the mAP of the C-CenterNet model applied in the cigarette appearance defect detection task is 95.01%. Compared with the original CenterNet model, the model's success rate is increased by 6.14%, so it can meet the requirements of precision and adaptability in cigarette detection tasks on the automatic cigarette production line.</description>

      <title>Improved YOLOv5s model for key components detection of power transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-voltage transmission lines are located far from the road, resulting in inconvenient inspection work and rising maintenance costs. Intelligent inspection of power transmission lines has become increasingly important. However, subsequent intelligent inspection relies on accurately detecting various key components. Due to the low detection accuracy of key components in transmission line image inspection, this paper proposed an improved object detection model based on the YOLOv5s (You Only Look Once Version 5 Small) model to improve the detection accuracy of key components of transmission lines. According to the characteristics of the power grid inspection image, we first modify the distance measurement in the k-means clustering to improve the anchor matching of the YOLOv5s model. Then, we add the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) attention mechanism to the backbone network to improve accuracy. Finally, we apply the focal loss function to reduce the impact of class imbalance. Our improved method's mAP (mean average precision) reached 98.1%, the precision reached 97.5%, the recall reached 94.4%, and the detection rate reached 84.8 FPS (frames per second). The experimental results show that our improved model improves detection accuracy and has performance advantages over other models.</description>

      <title>Self-Correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-modal tasks, they are prone to generating hallucinatory text responses that do not align with the given visual input, which restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/zhangce01/DeGF.</description>

Abstract: The Visually Rich Form Document Intelligence and Understanding (VRDIU) Track B focuses on the localization of key information in document images. The goal is to develop a method capable of localizing objects in both digital and handwritten documents, using only digital documents for training. This paper presents a simple yet effective approach that includes a document augmentation phase and an object detection phase. Specifically, we augment the training set of digital documents by mimicking the appearance of handwritten documents. Our experiments demonstrate that this pipeline enhances the models' generalization ability and achieves high performance in the competition.</description>

      <title>Integrating Sequence and Image Modeling in Irregular Medical Time Series Through Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical time series are often irregular and face significant missingness, posing challenges for data analysis and clinical decision-making. Existing methods typically adopt a single modeling perspective, either treating series data as sequences or transforming them into image representations for further classification. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework that incorporates both sequence and image representations. We also design three self-supervised learning strategies to facilitate the fusion of sequence and image representations, capturing a more generalizable joint representation. The results indicate that our approach outperforms seven other state-of-the-art models in three representative real-world clinical datasets. We further validate our approach by simulating two major types of real-world missingness through leave-sensors-out and leave-samples-out techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach is more robust and significantly surpasses other baselines in terms of classification performance.</description>

      <title>Animate Anyone 2: High-Fidelity Character Image Animation with Environment Affordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent character image animation methods based on diffusion models, such as Animate Anyone, have made significant progress in generating consistent and generalizable character animations. However, these approaches fail to produce reasonable associations between characters and their environments. To address this limitation, we introduce Animate Anyone 2, aiming to animate characters with environment affordance. Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model to handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Efficient-vDiT: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers With Attention Tile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the promise of synthesizing high-fidelity videos, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention suffer from expensive inference due to the complexity of attention computation and numerous sampling steps. For example, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for generating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency issue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy within video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the 3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D attention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2) Shorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency distillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and perform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step generation capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to conjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities. Notably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into an efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video generation with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is amenable to distributed inference, achieving an additional 3.91x speedup when running on 4 GPUs with sequence parallelism.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Implicit-Based Approach for Modeling Local Spatial Effects: A Case Study of Global Gross Primary Productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Earth sciences, unobserved factors exhibit non-stationary spatial distributions, causing the relationships between features and targets to display spatial heterogeneity. In geographic machine learning tasks, conventional statistical learning methods often struggle to capture spatial heterogeneity, leading to unsatisfactory prediction accuracy and unreliable interpretability. While approaches like Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) capture local variations, they fall short of uncovering global patterns and tracking the continuous evolution of spatial heterogeneity. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel perspective - that is, simultaneously modeling common features across different locations alongside spatial differences using deep neural networks. The proposed method is a dual-branch neural network with an encoder-decoder structure. In the encoding stage, the method aggregates node information in a spatiotemporal conditional graph using GCN and LSTM, encoding location-specific spatiotemporal heterogeneity as an implicit conditional vector. Additionally, a self-attention-based encoder is used to extract location-invariant common features from the data. In the decoding stage, the approach employs a conditional generation strategy that predicts response variables and interpretative weights based on data features under spatiotemporal conditions. The approach is validated by predicting vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) using global climate and land cover data from 2001 to 2020. Trained on 50 million samples and tested on 2.8 million, the proposed model achieves an RMSE of 0.836, outperforming LightGBM (1.063) and TabNet (0.944). Visualization analyses indicate that our method can reveal the distribution differences of the dominant factors of GPP across various times and locations.</description>

      <title>PLATTER: A Page-Level Handwritten Text Recognition System for Indic Scripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has seen the emergence of various new models, each claiming to perform competitively better than the other in specific scenarios. However, making a fair comparison of these models is challenging due to inconsistent choices and diversity in test sets. Furthermore, recent advancements in HTR often fail to account for the diverse languages, especially Indic languages, likely due to the scarcity of relevant labeled datasets. Moreover, much of the previous work has focused primarily on character-level or word-level recognition, overlooking the crucial stage of Handwritten Text Detection (HTD) necessary for building a page-level end-to-end handwritten OCR pipeline. Through our paper, we address these gaps by making three pivotal contributions. Firstly, we present an end-to-end framework for Page-Level hAndwriTTen TExt Recognition (PLATTER) by treating it as a two-stage problem involving word-level HTD followed by HTR. This approach enables us to identify, assess, and address challenges in each stage independently. Secondly, we demonstrate the usage of PLATTER to measure the performance of our language-agnostic HTD model and present a consistent comparison of six trained HTR models on ten diverse Indic languages thereby encouraging consistent comparisons. Finally, we also release a Corpus of Handwritten Indic Scripts (CHIPS), a meticulously curated, page-level Indic handwritten OCR dataset labeled for both detection and recognition purposes. Additionally, we release our code and trained models, to encourage further contributions in this direction.</description>

      <title>CANeRV: Content Adaptive Neural Representation for Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video compression introduce implicit neural representation (INR) based methods, which effectively capture global dependencies and characteristics of entire video sequences. Unlike traditional and deep learning based approaches, INR-based methods optimize network parameters from a global perspective, resulting in superior compression potential. However, most current INR methods utilize a fixed and uniform network architecture across all frames, limiting their adaptability to dynamic variations within and between video sequences. This often leads to suboptimal compression outcomes as these methods struggle to capture the distinct nuances and transitions in video content. To overcome these challenges, we propose Content Adaptive Neural Representation for Video Compression (CANeRV), an innovative INR-based video compression network that adaptively conducts structure optimisation based on the specific content of each video sequence. To better capture dynamic information across video sequences, we propose a dynamic sequence-level adjustment (DSA). Furthermore, to enhance the capture of dynamics between frames within a sequence, we implement a dynamic frame-level adjustment (DFA). {Finally, to effectively capture spatial structural information within video frames, thereby enhancing the detail restoration capabilities of CANeRV, we devise a structure level hierarchical structural adaptation (HSA).} Experimental results demonstrate that CANeRV can outperform both H.266/VVC and state-of-the-art INR-based video compression techniques across diverse video datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Decoupled Relational Distillation for Heterogeneous Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous distillation is an effective way to transfer knowledge from cross-architecture teacher models to student models. However, existing heterogeneous distillation methods do not take full advantage of the dark knowledge hidden in the teacher's output, limiting their performance.To this end, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Level Decoupled Relational Knowledge Distillation (MLDR-KD) to unleash the potential of relational distillation in heterogeneous distillation. Concretely, we first introduce Decoupled Finegrained Relation Alignment (DFRA) in both logit and feature levels to balance the trade-off between distilled dark knowledge and the confidence in the correct category of the heterogeneous teacher model. Then, Multi-Scale Dynamic Fusion (MSDF) module is applied to dynamically fuse the projected logits of multiscale features at different stages in student model, further improving performance of our method in feature level. We verify our method on four architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs and Mambas), two datasets (CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet). Compared with the best available method, our MLDR-KD improves student model performance with gains of up to 4.86% on CIFAR-100 and 2.78% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets respectively, showing robustness and generality in heterogeneous distillation. Code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Task Representation Memory Bank vs. Catastrophic Forgetting in Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Continuous Anomaly Detection (UCAD) faces significant challenges in multi-task representation learning, with existing methods suffering from incomplete representation and catastrophic forgetting. Unlike supervised models, unsupervised scenarios lack prior information, making it difficult to effectively distinguish redundant and complementary multimodal features. To address this, we propose the Multimodal Task Representation Memory Bank (MTRMB) method through two key technical innovations: A Key-Prompt-Multimodal Knowledge (KPMK) mechanism that uses concise key prompts to guide cross-modal feature interaction between BERT and ViT. Refined Structure-based Contrastive Learning (RSCL) leveraging Grounding DINO and SAM to generate precise segmentation masks, pulling features of the same structural region closer while pushing different structural regions apart. Experiments on MVtec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate MTRMB's superiority, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.921 at the lowest forgetting rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We plan to open source on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for denoising binary images using simulated annealing (SA), a global optimization technique that addresses the inherent challenges of non convex energy functions. Binary images are often corrupted by noise, necessitating effective restoration methods. We propose an energy function E(x, y) that captures the relationship between the noisy image y and the desired clean image x. Our algorithm combines simulated annealing with a localized optimization strategy to efficiently navigate the solution space, minimizing the energy function while maintaining computational efficiency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method against traditional iterative conditional modes (ICM), employing a binary image with 10% pixel corruption as a test case. Experimental results demonstrate that the simulated annealing method achieves a significant restoration improvement, yielding a 99.19% agreement with the original image compared to 96.21% for ICM. Visual assessments reveal that simulated annealing effectively removes noise while preserving structural details, making it a promising approach for binary image denoising. This work contributes to the field of image processing by highlighting the advantages of incorporating global optimization techniques in restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>Fully Exploiting Vision Foundation Model's Profound Prior Knowledge for Generalizable RGB-Depth Driving Scene Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent vision foundation models (VFMs), typically based on Vision Transformer (ViT), have significantly advanced numerous computer vision tasks. Despite their success in tasks focused solely on RGB images, the potential of VFMs in RGB-depth driving scene parsing remains largely under-explored. In this article, we take one step toward this emerging research area by investigating a feasible technique to fully exploit VFMs for generalizable RGB-depth driving scene parsing. Specifically, we explore the inherent characteristics of RGB and depth data, thereby presenting a Heterogeneous Feature Integration Transformer (HFIT). This network enables the efficient extraction and integration of comprehensive heterogeneous features without re-training ViTs. Relative depth prediction results from VFMs, used as inputs to the HFIT side adapter, overcome the limitations of the dependence on depth maps. Our proposed HFIT demonstrates superior performance compared to all other traditional single-modal and data-fusion scene parsing networks, pre-trained VFMs, and ViT adapters on the Cityscapes and KITTI Semantics datasets. We believe this novel strategy paves the way for future innovations in VFM-based data-fusion techniques for driving scene parsing. Our source code is publicly available at https://mias.group/HFIT.</description>

      <title>FunduSAM: A Specialized Deep Learning Model for Enhanced Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation in Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained popularity as a versatile image segmentation method, thanks to its strong generalization capabilities across various domains. However, when applied to optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation tasks, SAM encounters challenges due to the complex structures, low contrast, and blurred boundaries typical of fundus images, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel model, FunduSAM, which incorporates several Adapters into SAM to create a deep network specifically designed for OD and OC segmentation. The FunduSAM utilizes Adapter into each transformer block after encoder for parameter fine-tuning (PEFT). It enhances SAM's feature extraction capabilities by designing a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), addressing issues related to blurred boundaries and low contrast. Given the unique requirements of OD and OC segmentation, polar transformation is used to convert the original fundus OD images into a format better suited for training and evaluating FunduSAM. A joint loss is used to achieve structure preservation between the OD and OC, while accurate segmentation. Extensive experiments on the REFUGE dataset, comprising 1,200 fundus images, demonstrate the superior performance of FunduSAM compared to five mainstream approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised deep learning for semantic segmentation of multispectral LiDAR forest point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point clouds captured with laser scanning systems from forest environments can be utilized in a wide variety of applications within forestry and plant ecology, such as the estimation of tree stem attributes, leaf angle distribution, and above-ground biomass. However, effectively utilizing the data in such tasks requires the semantic segmentation of the data into wood and foliage points, also known as leaf-wood separation. The traditional approach to leaf-wood separation has been geometry- and radiometry-based unsupervised algorithms, which tend to perform poorly on data captured with airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems, even with a high point density. While recent machine and deep learning approaches achieve great results even on sparse point clouds, they require manually labeled training data, which is often extremely laborious to produce. Multispectral (MS) information has been demonstrated to have potential for improving the accuracy of leaf-wood separation, but quantitative assessment of its effects has been lacking. This study proposes a fully unsupervised deep learning method, GrowSP-ForMS, which is specifically designed for leaf-wood separation of high-density MS ALS point clouds and based on the GrowSP architecture. GrowSP-ForMS achieved a mean accuracy of 84.3% and a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 69.6% on our MS test set, outperforming the unsupervised reference methods by a significant margin. When compared to supervised deep learning methods, our model performed similarly to the slightly older PointNet architecture but was outclassed by more recent approaches. Finally, two ablation studies were conducted, which demonstrated that our proposed changes increased the test set mIoU of GrowSP-ForMS by 29.4 percentage points (pp) in comparison to the original GrowSP model and that utilizing MS data improved the mIoU by 5.6 pp from the monospectral case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces an AI-driven skin lesion classification algorithm built on an enhanced Transformer architecture, addressing the challenges of accuracy and robustness in medical image analysis. By integrating a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and refining the self-attention process, the model effectively extracts both global and local features, enhancing its ability to detect lesions with ambiguous boundaries and intricate structures. Performance evaluation on the ISIC 2017 dataset demonstrates that the improved Transformer surpasses established AI models, including ResNet50, VGG19, ResNext, and Vision Transformer, across key metrics such as accuracy, AUC, F1-Score, and Precision. Grad-CAM visualizations further highlight the interpretability of the model, showcasing strong alignment between the algorithm's focus areas and actual lesion sites. This research underscores the transformative potential of advanced AI models in medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate and reliable diagnostic tools. Future work will explore the scalability of this approach to broader medical imaging tasks and investigate the integration of multimodal data to enhance AI-driven diagnostic frameworks for intelligent healthcare.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Intelligent Laser Weeding: Method and Dataset for Weed Stem Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weed control is a critical challenge in modern agriculture, as weeds compete with crops for essential nutrient resources, significantly reducing crop yield and quality. Traditional weed control methods, including chemical and mechanical approaches, have real-life limitations such as associated environmental impact and efficiency. An emerging yet effective approach is laser weeding, which uses a laser beam as the stem cutter. Although there have been studies that use deep learning in weed recognition, its application in intelligent laser weeding still requires a comprehensive understanding. Thus, this study represents the first empirical investigation of weed recognition for laser weeding. To increase the efficiency of laser beam cut and avoid damaging the crops of interest, the laser beam shall be directly aimed at the weed root. Yet, weed stem detection remains an under-explored problem. We integrate the detection of crop and weed with the localization of weed stem into one end-to-end system. To train and validate the proposed system in a real-life scenario, we curate and construct a high-quality weed stem detection dataset with human annotations. The dataset consists of 7,161 high-resolution pictures collected in the field with annotations of 11,151 instances of weed. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves weeding accuracy by 6.7% and reduces energy cost by 32.3% compared to existing weed recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching for Visual Misinformation Detection Using Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in generative AI techniques, which have significantly increased the online dissemination of altered images and videos, have raised serious concerns about the credibility of digital media available on the Internet and distributed through information channels and social networks. This issue particularly affects domains that rely heavily on trustworthy data, such as journalism, forensic analysis, and Earth observation. To address these concerns, the ability to geolocate a non-geo-tagged ground-view image without external information, such as GPS coordinates, has become increasingly critical. This study tackles the challenge of linking a ground-view image, potentially exhibiting varying fields of view (FoV), to its corresponding satellite image without the aid of GPS data. To achieve this, we propose a novel four-stream Siamese-like architecture, the Quadruple Semantic Align Net (SAN-QUAD), which extends previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches by leveraging semantic segmentation applied to both ground and satellite imagery. Experimental results on a subset of the CVUSA dataset demonstrate significant improvements of up to 9.8\% over prior methods across various FoV settings.</description>

      <title>Cell Nuclei Detection and Classification in Whole Slide Images with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient cell nuclei detection and classification in histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are pivotal for digital pathology applications. Traditional cell segmentation approaches, while commonly used, are computationally expensive and require extensive post-processing, limiting their practicality for high-throughput clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from segmentation to detection for extracting cell information from WSIs, introducing CellNuc-DETR as a more effective solution. We evaluate the accuracy performance of CellNuc-DETR on the PanNuke dataset and conduct cross-dataset evaluations on CoNSeP and MoNuSeg to assess robustness and generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image demoir\'eing poses one of the most formidable challenges in image restoration, primarily due to the unpredictable and anisotropic nature of moir\'e patterns. Limited by the quantity and diversity of training data, current methods tend to overfit to a single moir\'e domain, resulting in performance degradation for new domains and restricting their robustness in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a universal image demoir\'eing solution, UniDemoir\'e, which has superior generalization capability. Notably, we propose innovative and effective data generation and synthesis methods that can automatically provide vast high-quality moir\'e images to train a universal demoir\'eing model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the cutting-edge performance and broad potential of our approach for generalized image demoir\'eing.</description>

      <title>DefTransNet: A Transformer-based Method for Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration in the Simulation of Soft Tissue Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft-tissue surgeries, such as tumor resections, are complicated by tissue deformations that can obscure the accurate location and shape of tissues. By representing tissue surfaces as point clouds and applying non-rigid point cloud registration (PCR) methods, surgeons can better understand tissue deformations before, during, and after surgery. Existing non-rigid PCR methods, such as feature-based approaches, struggle with robustness against challenges like noise, outliers, partial data, and large deformations, making accurate point correspondence difficult. Although learning-based PCR methods, particularly Transformer-based approaches, have recently shown promise due to their attention mechanisms for capturing interactions, their robustness remains limited in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we present DefTransNet, a novel end-to-end Transformer-based architecture for non-rigid PCR. DefTransNet is designed to address the key challenges of deformable registration, including large deformations, outliers, noise, and partial data, by inputting source and target point clouds and outputting displacement vector fields. The proposed method incorporates a learnable transformation matrix to enhance robustness to affine transformations, integrates global and local geometric information, and captures long-range dependencies among points using Transformers. We validate our approach on four datasets: ModelNet, SynBench, 4DMatch, and DeformedTissue, using both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the generalization of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that DefTransNet outperforms current state-of-the-art registration networks across various challenging conditions. Our code and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Outlier-robust Rotation Estimation by Stereographic Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in many computer vision and robot tasks. However, efficiently estimating rotation in large inputs containing numerous outliers (i.e., mismatches) and noise is a recognized challenge. Many robust rotation estimation methods have been designed to address this challenge. Unfortunately, existing methods are often inapplicable due to their long computation time and the risk of local optima. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust rotation estimation method. Specifically, our method first investigates geometric constraints involving only the rotation axis. Then, it uses stereographic projection and spatial voting techniques to identify the rotation axis and angle. Furthermore, our method efficiently obtains the optimal rotation estimation and can estimate multiple rotations simultaneously. To verify the feasibility of our method, we conduct comparative experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that, with GPU assistance, our method can solve large-scale ($10^6$ points) and severely corrupted (90\% outlier rate) rotation estimation problems within 0.07 seconds, with an angular error of only 0.01 degrees, which is superior to existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Depth Completion via Test-time Alignment with Affine-invariant Depth Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth completion, predicting dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements, is an ill-posed problem requiring prior knowledge. Recent methods adopt learning-based approaches to implicitly capture priors, but the priors primarily fit in-domain data and do not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a zero-shot depth completion method composed of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment. We use pre-trained depth diffusion models as depth prior knowledge, which implicitly understand how to fill in depth for scenes. Our approach aligns the affine-invariant depth prior with metric-scale sparse measurements, enforcing them as hard constraints via an optimization loop at test-time. Our zero-shot depth completion method demonstrates generalization across various domain datasets, achieving up to a 21\% average performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods while enhancing spatial understanding by sharpening scene details. We demonstrate that aligning a monocular affine-invariant depth prior with sparse metric measurements is a proven strategy to achieve domain-generalizable depth completion without relying on extensive training data.

      <title>Facial Analysis Systems and Down Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ethical, social and legal issues surrounding facial analysis technologies have been widely debated in recent years. Key critics have argued that these technologies can perpetuate bias and discrimination, particularly against marginalized groups. We contribute to this field of research by reporting on the limitations of facial analysis systems with the faces of people with Down syndrome: this particularly vulnerable group has received very little attention in the literature so far. This study involved the creation of a specific dataset of face images. An experimental group with faces of people with Down syndrome, and a control group with faces of people who are not affected by the syndrome. Two commercial tools were tested on the dataset, along three tasks: gender recognition, age prediction and face labelling. The results show an overall lower accuracy of prediction in the experimental group, and other specific patterns of performance differences: i) high error rates in gender recognition in the category of males with Down syndrome; ii) adults with Down syndrome were more often incorrectly labelled as children; iii) social stereotypes are propagated in both the control and experimental groups, with labels related to aesthetics more often associated with women, and labels related to education level and skills more often associated with men. These results, although limited in scope, shed new light on the biases that alter face classification when applied to faces of people with Down syndrome. They confirm the structural limitation of the technology, which is inherently dependent on the datasets used to train the models.</description>

      <title>LANTERN++: Enhanced Relaxed Speculative Decoding with Static Tree Drafting for Visual Auto-regressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has been widely used to accelerate autoregressive (AR) text generation. However, its effectiveness in visual AR models remains limited due to token selection ambiguity, where multiple tokens receive similarly low probabilities, reducing acceptance rates. While dynamic tree drafting has been proposed to improve speculative decoding, we show that it fails to mitigate token selection ambiguity, resulting in shallow draft trees and suboptimal acceleration. To address this, we introduce LANTERN++, a novel framework that integrates static tree drafting with a relaxed acceptance condition, allowing drafts to be selected independently of low-confidence predictions. This enables deeper accepted sequences, improving decoding efficiency while preserving image quality. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art visual AR models demonstrate that LANTERN++ significantly accelerates inference, achieving up to $\mathbf{\times 2.56}$ speedup over standard AR decoding while maintaining high image quality.</description>

      <title>Guidance-base Diffusion Models for Improving Photoacoustic Image Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.</description>

      <title>FOCUS - Multi-View Foot Reconstruction From Synthetically Trained Dense Correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction from multiple, calibrated images is a challenging task - often requiring a large number of collected images with significant overlap. We look at the specific case of human foot reconstruction. As with previous successful foot reconstruction work, we seek to extract rich per-pixel geometry cues from multi-view RGB images, and fuse these into a final 3D object. Our method, FOCUS, tackles this problem with 3 main contributions: (i) SynFoot2, an extension of an existing synthetic foot dataset to include a new data type: dense correspondence with the parameterized foot model FIND; (ii) an uncertainty-aware dense correspondence predictor trained on our synthetic dataset; (iii) two methods for reconstructing a 3D surface from dense correspondence predictions: one inspired by Structure-from-Motion, and one optimization-based using the FIND model. We show that our reconstruction achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality in a few-view setting, performing comparably to state-of-the-art when many views are available, and runs substantially faster. We release our synthetic dataset to the research community. Code is available at: https://github.com/OllieBoyne/FOCUS</description>

      <title>When Data Manipulation Meets Attack Goals: An In-depth Survey of Attacks for VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained considerable prominence in recent years due to their remarkable capability to effectively integrate and process both textual and visual information. This integration has significantly enhanced performance across a diverse spectrum of applications, such as scene perception and robotics. However, the deployment of VLMs has also given rise to critical safety and security concerns, necessitating extensive research to assess the potential vulnerabilities these VLM systems may harbor. In this work, we present an in-depth survey of the attack strategies tailored for VLMs. We categorize these attacks based on their underlying objectives - namely jailbreak, camouflage, and exploitation - while also detailing the various methodologies employed for data manipulation of VLMs. Meanwhile, we outline corresponding defense mechanisms that have been proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities. By discerning key connections and distinctions among the diverse types of attacks, we propose a compelling taxonomy for VLM attacks. Moreover, we summarize the evaluation metrics that comprehensively describe the characteristics and impact of different attacks on VLMs. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of promising future research directions that could further enhance the robustness and safety of VLMs, emphasizing the importance of ongoing exploration in this critical area of study. To facilitate community engagement, we maintain an up-to-date project page, accessible at: https://github.com/AobtDai/VLM_Attack_Paper_List.</description>

      <title>TANGLED: Generating 3D Hair Strands from Images with Arbitrary Styles and Viewpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hairstyles are intricate and culturally significant with various geometries, textures, and structures. Existing text or image-guided generation methods fail to handle the richness and complexity of diverse styles. We present TANGLED, a novel approach for 3D hair strand generation that accommodates diverse image inputs across styles, viewpoints, and quantities of input views. TANGLED employs a three-step pipeline. First, our MultiHair Dataset provides 457 diverse hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes, emphasizing complex and culturally significant styles to improve model generalization. Second, we propose a diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts that can capture topological cues (e.g., strand density and parting lines) while filtering out noise. By leveraging a latent diffusion model with cross-attention on lineart features, our method achieves flexible and robust 3D hair generation across diverse input conditions. Third, a parametric post-processing module enforces braid-specific constraints to maintain coherence in complex structures. This framework not only advances hairstyle realism and diversity but also enables culturally inclusive digital avatars and novel applications like sketch-based 3D strand editing for animation and augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Robust Watermarks Leak: Channel-Aware Feature Extraction Enables Adversarial Watermark Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking plays a key role in the provenance and detection of AI-generated content. While existing methods prioritize robustness against real-world distortions (e.g., JPEG compression and noise addition), we reveal a fundamental tradeoff: such robust watermarks inherently improve the redundancy of detectable patterns encoded into images, creating exploitable information leakage. To leverage this, we propose an attack framework that extracts leakage of watermark patterns through multi-channel feature learning using a pre-trained vision model. Unlike prior works requiring massive data or detector access, our method achieves both forgery and detection evasion with a single watermarked image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 60\% success rate gain in detection evasion and 51\% improvement in forgery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining visual fidelity. Our work exposes the robustness-stealthiness paradox: current "robust" watermarks sacrifice security for distortion resistance, providing insights for future watermark design.</description>

      <title>Hybrid State-Space and GRU-based Graph Tokenization Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, agriculture, and urban planning. However, it faces significant challenges due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the complex spectral-spatial relationships inherent in HSI. Traditional methods, including conventional machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often struggle to effectively capture these intricate spectral-spatial features and global contextual information. Transformer-based models, while powerful in capturing long-range dependencies, often demand substantial computational resources, posing challenges in scenarios where labeled datasets are limited, as is commonly seen in HSI applications. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes GraphMamba, a hybrid model that combines spectral-spatial token generation, graph-based token prioritization, and cross-attention mechanisms. The model introduces a novel hybridization of state-space modeling and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), capturing both linear and nonlinear spatial-spectral dynamics. GraphMamba enhances the ability to model complex spatial-spectral relationships while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency across diverse HSI datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that GraphMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering a scalable and robust solution for complex HSI classification tasks.</description>

      <title>CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.</description>

      <title>FCVSR: A Frequency-aware Method for Compressed Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) compressed videos. Recently, some compressed video SR methods attempt to exploit the spatio-temporal information in the frequency domain, showing great promise in super-resolution performance. However, these methods do not differentiate various frequency subbands spatially or capture the temporal frequency dynamics, potentially leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-based compressed video SR model (FCVSR) consisting of a motion-guided adaptive alignment (MGAA) network and a multi-frequency feature refinement (MFFR) module. Additionally, a frequency-aware contrastive loss is proposed for training FCVSR, in order to reconstruct finer spatial details. The proposed model has been evaluated on three public compressed video super-resolution datasets, with results demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to existing works in terms of super-resolution performance (up to a 0.14dB gain in PSNR over the second-best model) and complexity.</description>

      <title>Prompt-SID: Learning Structural Representation Prompt via Latent Diffusion for Single-Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies have concentrated on constructing supervised models utilizing paired datasets for image denoising, which proves to be expensive and time-consuming. Current self-supervised and unsupervised approaches typically rely on blind-spot networks or sub-image pairs sampling, resulting in pixel information loss and destruction of detailed structural information, thereby significantly constraining the efficacy of such methods. In this paper, we introduce Prompt-SID, a prompt-learning-based single image denoising framework that emphasizes preserving of structural details. This approach is trained in a self-supervised manner using downsampled image pairs. It captures original-scale image information through structural encoding and integrates this prompt into the denoiser. To achieve this, we propose a structural representation generation model based on the latent diffusion process and design a structural attention module within the transformer-based denoiser architecture to decode the prompt. Additionally, we introduce a scale replay training mechanism, which effectively mitigates the scale gap from images of different resolutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on synthetic, real-world, and fluorescence imaging datasets, showcasing the remarkable effectiveness of Prompt-SID.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Large-scale Dataset Compression: Shifting Focus From Labels to Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation and dataset pruning are two prominent techniques for compressing datasets to improve computational and storage efficiency. Despite their overlapping objectives, these approaches are rarely compared directly. Even within each field, the evaluation protocols are inconsistent across various methods, which complicates fair comparisons and hinders reproducibility. Considering these limitations, we introduce in this paper a benchmark that equitably evaluates methodologies across both distillation and pruning literatures. Notably, our benchmark reveals that in the mainstream dataset distillation setting for large-scale datasets, which heavily rely on soft labels from pre-trained models, even randomly selected subsets can achieve surprisingly competitive performance. This finding suggests that an overemphasis on soft labels may be diverting attention from the intrinsic value of the image data, while also imposing additional burdens in terms of generation, storage, and application. To address these issues, we propose a new framework for dataset compression, termed Prune, Combine, and Augment (PCA), which focuses on leveraging image data exclusively, relies solely on hard labels for evaluation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in this setup. By shifting the emphasis back to the images, our benchmark and PCA framework pave the way for more balanced and accessible techniques in dataset compression research.

      <title>Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Optical Character Recognition in Dynamic Video Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks in dynamic video environments. We present a curated dataset containing 1,477 manually annotated frames spanning diverse domains, including code editors, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, and advertisements. Three state of the art VLMs - Claude-3, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o are benchmarked against traditional OCR systems such as EasyOCR and RapidOCR. Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios. However, challenges such as hallucinations, content security policies, and sensitivity to occluded or stylized text remain. The dataset and benchmarking framework are publicly available to foster further research.</description>

      <title>SparseFocus: Learning-based One-shot Autofocus for Microscopy with Sparse Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autofocus is necessary for high-throughput and real-time scanning in microscopic imaging. Traditional methods rely on complex hardware or iterative hill-climbing algorithms. Recent learning-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in a one-shot setting, avoiding hardware modifications or iterative mechanical lens adjustments. However, in this paper, we highlight a significant challenge that the richness of image content can significantly affect autofocus performance. When the image content is sparse, previous autofocus methods, whether traditional climbing-hill or learning-based, tend to fail. To tackle this, we propose a content-importance-based solution, named SparseFocus, featuring a novel two-stage pipeline. The first stage measures the importance of regions within the image, while the second stage calculates the defocus distance from selected important regions. To validate our approach and benefit the research community, we collect a large-scale dataset comprising millions of labelled defocused images, encompassing both dense, sparse and extremely sparse scenarios. Experimental results show that SparseFocus surpasses existing methods, effectively handling all levels of content sparsity. Moreover, we integrate SparseFocus into our Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) system that performs well in real-world applications. The code and dataset will be made available upon the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>Group-CLIP Uncertainty Modeling for Group Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Re-Identification (Group ReID) aims matching groups of pedestrians across non-overlapping cameras. Unlike single-person ReID, Group ReID focuses more on the changes in group structure, emphasizing the number of members and their spatial arrangement. However, most methods rely on certainty-based models, which consider only the specific group structures in the group images, often failing to match unseen group configurations. To this end, we propose a novel Group-CLIP UncertaintyModeling (GCUM) approach that adapts group text descriptions to undetermined accommodate member and layout variations. Specifically, we design a Member Variant Simulation (MVS)module that simulates member exclusions using a Bernoulli distribution and a Group Layout Adaptation (GLA) module that generates uncertain group text descriptions with identity-specific tokens. In addition, we design a Group RelationshipConstruction Encoder (GRCE) that uses group features to refine individual features, and employ cross-modal contrastive loss to obtain generalizable knowledge from group text descriptions. It is worth noting that we are the first to employ CLIP to GroupReID, and extensive experiments show that GCUM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Group ReID methods.</description>

      <title>UniMoD: Efficient Unified Multimodal Transformers with Mixture-of-Depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal transformers, which handle both generation and understanding tasks within a shared parameter space, have received increasing attention in recent research. Although various unified transformers have been proposed, training these models is costly due to redundant tokens and heavy attention computation. In the past, studies on large language models have demonstrated that token pruning methods, such as Mixture of Depths (MoD), can significantly improve computational efficiency. MoD employs a router to select the most important ones for processing within a transformer layer. However, directly applying MoD-based token pruning to unified transformers will result in suboptimal performance because different tasks exhibit varying levels of token redundancy. In our work, we analyze the unified transformers by (1) examining attention weight patterns, (2) evaluating the layer importance and token redundancy, and (3) analyzing task interactions. Our findings reveal that token redundancy is primarily influenced by different tasks and layers. Building on these findings, we introduce UniMoD, a task-aware token pruning method that employs a separate router for each task to determine which tokens should be pruned. We apply our method to Show-o and Emu3, reducing training FLOPs by approximately 15% in Show-o and 40% in Emu3, while maintaining or improving performance on several benchmarks. Code will be released at https://github.com/showlab/UniMoD.</description>

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) measures and predicts perceived image quality by human observers. Although recent studies have highlighted the critical influence that variations in the scale of an image have on its perceived quality, this relationship has not been systematically quantified. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Image Intrinsic Scale (IIS), defined as the largest scale where an image exhibits its highest perceived quality. We also present the Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment (IISA) task, which involves subjectively measuring and predicting the IIS based on human judgments. We develop a subjective annotation methodology and create the IISA-DB dataset, comprising 785 image-IIS pairs annotated by experts in a rigorously controlled crowdsourcing study. Furthermore, we propose WIISA (Weak-labeling for Image Intrinsic Scale Assessment), a strategy that leverages how the IIS of an image varies with downscaling to generate weak labels. Experiments show that applying WIISA during the training of several IQA methods adapted for IISA consistently improves the performance compared to using only ground-truth labels. We will release the code, dataset, and pre-trained models upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Biomechanical Reconstruction with Confidence Intervals from Multiview Markerless Motion Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in multiview markerless motion capture (MMMC) promise high-quality movement analysis for clinical practice and research. While prior validation studies show MMMC performs well on average, they do not provide what is needed in clinical practice or for large-scale utilization of MMMC -- confidence intervals over specific kinematic estimates from a specific individual analyzed using a possibly unique camera configuration. We extend our previous work using an implicit representation of trajectories optimized end-to-end through a differentiable biomechanical model to learn the posterior probability distribution over pose given all the detected keypoints. This posterior probability is learned through a variational approximation and estimates confidence intervals for individual joints at each moment in a trial, showing confidence intervals generally within 10-15 mm of spatial error for virtual marker locations, consistent with our prior validation studies. Confidence intervals over joint angles are typically only a few degrees and widen for more distal joints. The posterior also models the correlation structure over joint angles, such as correlations between hip and pelvis angles. The confidence intervals estimated through this method allow us to identify times and trials where kinematic uncertainty is high.</description>

      <title>Decision Boundary Optimization-Informed Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is widely used in a number of domain adaptation (DA) methods and shows its effectiveness in aligning data distributions across domains. However, in previous DA research, MMD-based DA methods focus mostly on distribution alignment, and ignore to optimize the decision boundary for classification-aware DA, thereby falling short in reducing the DA upper error bound. In this paper, we propose a strengthened MMD measurement, namely, Decision Boundary optimization-informed MMD (DB-MMD), which enables MMD to carefully take into account the decision boundaries, thereby simultaneously optimizing the distribution alignment and cross-domain classifier within a hybrid framework, and leading to a theoretical bound guided DA. We further seamlessly embed the proposed DB-MMD measurement into several popular DA methods, e.g., MEDA, DGA-DA, to demonstrate its effectiveness w.r.t different experimental settings. We carry out comprehensive experiments using 8 standard DA datasets. The experimental results show that the DB-MMD enforced DA methods improve their baseline models using plain vanilla MMD, with a margin that can be as high as 9.5.</description>

      <title>Learning Clustering-based Prototypes for Compositional Zero-shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning primitive (i.e., attribute and object) concepts from seen compositions is the primary challenge of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). Existing CZSL solutions typically rely on oversimplified data assumptions, e.g., modeling each primitive with a single centroid primitive representation, ignoring the natural diversities of the attribute (resp. object) when coupled with different objects (resp. attribute). In this work, we develop ClusPro, a robust clustering-based prototype mining framework for CZSL that defines the conceptual boundaries of primitives through a set of diversified prototypes. Specifically, ClusPro conducts within-primitive clustering on the embedding space for automatically discovering and dynamically updating prototypes. These representative prototypes are subsequently used to repaint a well-structured and independent primitive embedding space, ensuring intra-primitive separation and inter-primitive decorrelation through prototype-based contrastive learning and decorrelation learning. Moreover, ClusPro efficiently performs prototype clustering in a non-parametric fashion without the introduction of additional learnable parameters or computational budget during testing. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate ClusPro outperforms various top-leading CZSL solutions under both closed-world and open-world settings.</description>

      <title>CustomVideoX: 3D Reference Attention Driven Dynamic Adaptation for Zero-Shot Customized Video Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customized generation has achieved significant progress in image synthesis, yet personalized video generation remains challenging due to temporal inconsistencies and quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce CustomVideoX, an innovative framework leveraging the video diffusion transformer for personalized video generation from a reference image. CustomVideoX capitalizes on pre-trained video networks by exclusively training the LoRA parameters to extract reference features, ensuring both efficiency and adaptability. To facilitate seamless interaction between the reference image and video content, we propose 3D Reference Attention, which enables direct and simultaneous engagement of reference image features with all video frames across spatial and temporal dimensions. To mitigate the excessive influence of reference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during inference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy, dynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally, we introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly activated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by adjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation, we establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100 prompts for extensive assessment. Experimental results show that CustomVideoX significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of video consistency and quality.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning for Feature Extraction and Temporal Alignment of 3D+t Point Clouds of Zebrafish Embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zebrafish are widely used in biomedical research and developmental stages of their embryos often need to be synchronized for further analysis. We present an unsupervised approach to extract descriptive features from 3D+t point clouds of zebrafish embryos and subsequently use those features to temporally align corresponding developmental stages. An autoencoder architecture is proposed to learn a descriptive representation of the point clouds and we designed a deep regression network for their temporal alignment. We achieve a high alignment accuracy with an average mismatch of only 3.83 minutes over an experimental duration of 5.3 hours. As a fully-unsupervised approach, there is no manual labeling effort required and unlike manual analyses the method easily scales. Besides, the alignment without human annotation of the data also avoids any influence caused by subjective bias.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Computational Neuroimaging: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational neuroimaging involves analyzing brain images or signals to provide mechanistic insights and predictive tools for human cognition and behavior. While diffusion models have shown stability and high-quality generation in natural images, there is increasing interest in adapting them to analyze brain data for various neurological tasks such as data enhancement, disease diagnosis and brain decoding. This survey provides an overview of recent efforts to integrate diffusion models into computational neuroimaging. We begin by introducing the common neuroimaging data modalities, follow with the diffusion formulations and conditioning mechanisms. Then we discuss how the variations of the denoising starting point, condition input and generation target of diffusion models are developed and enhance specific neuroimaging tasks. For a comprehensive overview of the ongoing research, we provide a publicly available repository at https://github.com/JoeZhao527/dm4neuro.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Perception for Unified Visual Multi-modal Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, many multi-modal trackers prioritize RGB as the dominant modality, treating other modalities as auxiliary, and fine-tuning separately various multi-modal tasks. This imbalance in modality dependence limits the ability of methods to dynamically utilize complementary information from each modality in complex scenarios, making it challenging to fully perceive the advantages of multi-modal. As a result, a unified parameter model often underperforms in various multi-modal tracking tasks. To address this issue, we propose APTrack, a novel unified tracker designed for multi-modal adaptive perception. Unlike previous methods, APTrack explores a unified representation through an equal modeling strategy. This strategy allows the model to dynamically adapt to various modalities and tasks without requiring additional fine-tuning between different tasks. Moreover, our tracker integrates an adaptive modality interaction (AMI) module that efficiently bridges cross-modality interactions by generating learnable tokens. Experiments conducted on five diverse multi-modal datasets (RGBT234, LasHeR, VisEvent, DepthTrack, and VOT-RGBD2022) demonstrate that APTrack not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art unified multi-modal trackers but also outperforms trackers designed for specific multi-modal tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models enable highly realistic image manipulations, creating an urgent need for robust forgery detection methods. Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mever-team/DiQuID.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating the material appearance of objects in images is critical for applications like augmented reality, virtual prototyping, and digital content creation. We present MaterialFusion, a novel framework for high-quality material transfer that allows users to adjust the degree of material application, achieving an optimal balance between new material properties and the object's original features. MaterialFusion seamlessly integrates the modified object into the scene by maintaining background consistency and mitigating boundary artifacts. To thoroughly evaluate our approach, we have compiled a dataset of real-world material transfer examples and conducted complex comparative analyses. Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and user studies, we demonstrate that MaterialFusion significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of quality, user control, and background preservation.

      <title>Illegal Waste Detection in Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental crime currently represents the third largest criminal activity worldwide while threatening ecosystems as well as human health. Among the crimes related to this activity, improper waste management can nowadays be countered more easily thanks to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing images, which enable semi-automatic territory scanning in search of illegal landfills. This paper proposes a pipeline, developed in collaboration with professionals from a local environmental agency, for detecting candidate illegal dumping sites leveraging a classifier of Remote Sensing images. To identify the best configuration for such classifier, an extensive set of experiments was conducted and the impact of diverse image characteristics and training settings was thoroughly analyzed. The local environmental agency was then involved in an experimental exercise where outputs from the developed classifier were integrated in the experts' everyday work, resulting in time savings with respect to manual photo-interpretation. The classifier was eventually run with valuable results on a location outside of the training area, highlighting potential for cross-border applicability of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>TripoSG: High-Fidelity 3D Shape Synthesis using Large-Scale Rectified Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video generation to unprece- dented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data process- ing, and insufficient exploration of advanced tech- niques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capa- bility, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffu- sion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high- quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high- quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D gen- erative models. Through comprehensive experi- ments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit en- hanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input im- ages. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong gen- eralization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Image-Driven Spatial Integration for Left Atrium Segmentation from Cardiac MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plays a vital role in visualizing diseased atrial structures, enabling the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. It is particularly essential for planning treatment with ablation therapy, a key intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, manual segmentation is time-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Class-agnostic foundation models like DINOv2 have demonstrated remarkable feature extraction capabilities in vision tasks. However, their lack of domain specificity and task-specific adaptation can reduce spatial resolution during feature extraction, impacting the capture of fine anatomical detail in medical imaging. To address this limitation, we propose a segmentation framework that integrates DINOv2 as an encoder with a UNet-style decoder, incorporating multi-scale feature fusion and input image integration to enhance segmentation accuracy. The learnable weighting mechanism dynamically prioritizes hierarchical features from different encoder blocks of the foundation model, optimizing feature selection for task relevance. Additionally, the input image is reintroduced during the decoding stage to preserve high-resolution spatial details, addressing limitations of downsampling in the encoder. We validate our approach on the LAScarQS 2022 dataset and demonstrate improved performance with a 92.3% Dice and 84.1% IoU score for giant architecture compared to the nnUNet baseline model. These findings emphasize the efficacy of our approach in advancing the field of automated left atrium segmentation from cardiac MRI.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.</description>

      <title>Conformal Predictions for Human Action Recognition with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) frameworks are integral to many real-world computer vision systems, enabling human operators to make informed decisions with AI assistance. Conformal Predictions (CP), which provide label sets with rigorous guarantees on ground truth inclusion probabilities, have recently gained traction as a valuable tool in HITL settings. One key application area is video surveillance, closely associated with Human Action Recognition (HAR). This study explores the application of CP on top of state-of-the-art HAR methods that utilize extensively pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our findings reveal that CP can significantly reduce the average number of candidate classes without modifying the underlying VLM. However, these reductions often result in distributions with long tails. To address this, we introduce a method based on tuning the temperature parameter of the VLMs to minimize these tails without requiring additional calibration data. Our code is made available on GitHub at the address https://github.com/tbary/CP4VLM.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Classification and Anatomical Localization of Tissues in SPECT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification and anatomical localization are essential for effective medical diagnostics and research, which may be efficiently performed using deep learning techniques. However, availability of limited labeled data poses a significant challenge. To address this, we adapted Prototypical Networks and the Propagation-Reconstruction Network (PRNet) for few-shot classification and localization, respectively, in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. For the proof of concept we used a 2D-sliced image cropped around heart. The Prototypical Network, with a pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone, classified ventricles, myocardium, and liver tissues with 96.67% training and 93.33% validation accuracy. PRNet, adapted for 2D imaging with an encoder-decoder architecture and skip connections, achieved a training loss of 1.395, accurately reconstructing patches and capturing spatial relationships. These results highlight the potential of Prototypical Networks for tissue classification with limited labeled data and PRNet for anatomical landmark localization, paving the way for improved performance in deep learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Prototype Contrastive Consistency Learning for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in medical image analysis, but it can be very challenging especially when there are less labeled data but with large unlabeled data. Contrastive learning has proven to be effective for medical image segmentation in semi-supervised learning by constructing contrastive samples from partial pixels. However, although previous contrastive learning methods can mine semantic information from partial pixels within images, they ignore the whole context information of unlabeled images, which is very important to precise segmentation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel prototype contrastive learning method called Prototype Contrastive Consistency Segmentation (PCCS) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The core idea is to enforce the prototypes of the same semantic class to be closer and push the prototypes in different semantic classes far away from each other. Specifically, we construct a signed distance map and an uncertainty map from unlabeled images. The signed distance map is used to construct prototypes for contrastive learning, and then we estimate the prototype uncertainty from the uncertainty map as trade-off among prototypes. In order to obtain better prototypes, based on the student-teacher architecture, a new mechanism named prototype updating prototype is designed to assist in updating the prototypes for contrastive learning. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-consistency loss to mine more reliable information from unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation demonstrate that PCCS achieves better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/comphsh/PCCS.</description>

      <title>CHIRLA: Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a key challenge in computer vision, requiring the matching of individuals across different cameras, locations, and time periods. While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust Re-ID systems capable of handling long-term scenarios, where persons' appearances can change significantly due to variations in clothing and physical characteristics. In this paper, we present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset specifically designed for long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA consists of recordings from strategically placed cameras over a seven-month period, capturing significant variations in both temporal and appearance attributes, including controlled changes in participants' clothing and physical features. The dataset includes 22 individuals, four connected indoor environments, and seven cameras. We collected more than five hours of video that we semi-automatically labeled to generate around one million bounding boxes with identity annotations. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Transfer Your Perspective: Controllable 3D Generation from Any Viewpoint in a Driving Scene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-driving cars relying solely on ego-centric perception face limitations in sensing, often failing to detect occluded, faraway objects. Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.</description>

      <title>TEMSET-24K: Densely Annotated Dataset for Indexing Multipart Endoscopic Videos using Surgical Timeline Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indexing endoscopic surgical videos is vital in surgical data science, forming the basis for systematic retrospective analysis and clinical performance evaluation. Despite its significance, current video analytics rely on manual indexing, a time-consuming process. Advances in computer vision, particularly deep learning, offer automation potential, yet progress is limited by the lack of publicly available, densely annotated surgical datasets. To address this, we present TEMSET-24K, an open-source dataset comprising 24,306 trans-anal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) video micro-clips. Each clip is meticulously annotated by clinical experts using a novel hierarchical labeling taxonomy encompassing phase, task, and action triplets, capturing intricate surgical workflows. To validate this dataset, we benchmarked deep learning models, including transformer-based architectures. Our in silico evaluation demonstrates high accuracy (up to 0.99) and F1 scores (up to 0.99) for key phases like Setup and Suturing. The STALNet model, tested with ConvNeXt, ViT, and SWIN V2 encoders, consistently segmented well-represented phases. TEMSET-24K provides a critical benchmark, propelling state-of-the-art solutions in surgical data science.</description>

      <title>Learning Musical Representations for Music Performance Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music performances are representative scenarios for audio-visual modeling. Unlike common scenarios with sparse audio, music performances continuously involve dense audio signals throughout. While existing multimodal learning methods on the audio-video QA demonstrate impressive capabilities in general scenarios, they are incapable of dealing with fundamental problems within the music performances: they underexplore the interaction between the multimodal signals in performance and fail to consider the distinctive characteristics of instruments and music. Therefore, existing methods tend to answer questions regarding musical performances inaccurately. To bridge the above research gaps, (i) given the intricate multimodal interconnectivity inherent to music data, our primary backbone is designed to incorporate multimodal interactions within the context of music; (ii) to enable the model to learn music characteristics, we annotate and release rhythmic and music sources in the current music datasets; (iii) for time-aware audio-visual modeling, we align the model's music predictions with the temporal dimension. Our experiments show state-of-the-art effects on the Music AVQA datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/xid32/Amuse.</description>

      <title>Se\~norita-2M: A High-Quality Instruction-based Dataset for General Video Editing by Video Specialists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have spurred the development of video editing techniques, which can be divided into inversion-based and end-to-end methods. However, current video editing methods still suffer from several challenges. Inversion-based methods, though training-free and flexible, are time-consuming during inference, struggle with fine-grained editing instructions, and produce artifacts and jitter. On the other hand, end-to-end methods, which rely on edited video pairs for training, offer faster inference speeds but often produce poor editing results due to a lack of high-quality training video pairs. In this paper, to close the gap in end-to-end methods, we introduce Se\~norita-2M, a high-quality video editing dataset. Se\~norita-2M consists of approximately 2 millions of video editing pairs. It is built by crafting four high-quality, specialized video editing models, each crafted and trained by our team to achieve state-of-the-art editing results. We also propose a filtering pipeline to eliminate poorly edited video pairs. Furthermore, we explore common video editing architectures to identify the most effective structure based on current pre-trained generative model. Extensive experiments show that our dataset can help to yield remarkably high-quality video editing results. More details are available at https://senorita.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung disease poses a substantial global health challenge, with pneumonia being a prevalent concern. This research focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to detect and assess pneumonia, addressing two interconnected objectives. Initially, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are introduced for pneumonia classification, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive diagnostic assessments considering COVID-19. Subsequently, the study advocates for the utilization of deep learning-based segmentation to determine the severity of infection. This dual-pronged approach offers valuable insights for medical professionals, facilitating a more nuanced understanding and effective treatment of pneumonia. Integrating deep learning aims to elevate the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia detection, thereby contributing to enhanced healthcare outcomes on a global scale.</description>

      <title>ViSIR: Vision Transformer Single Image Reconstruction Method for Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Earth system models (ESMs) integrate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and biosphere to estimate the state of regional and global climate under a wide variety of conditions. The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data.
  Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks.
  Results: The ViSIR outperforms ViT by 4.1 dB, SIREN by 7.5 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SR-GANs) by 7.1dB PSNR on average for three different measurements.
  Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM).</description>

      <title>Wandering around: A bioinspired approach to visual attention through object motion sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active vision enables dynamic visual perception, offering an alternative to static feedforward architectures in computer vision, which rely on large datasets and high computational resources. Biological selective attention mechanisms allow agents to focus on salient Regions of Interest (ROIs), reducing computational demand while maintaining real-time responsiveness. Event-based cameras, inspired by the mammalian retina, enhance this capability by capturing asynchronous scene changes enabling efficient low-latency processing. To distinguish moving objects while the event-based camera is in motion the agent requires an object motion segmentation mechanism to accurately detect targets and center them in the visual field (fovea). Integrating event-based sensors with neuromorphic algorithms represents a paradigm shift, using Spiking Neural Networks to parallelize computation and adapt to dynamic environments. This work presents a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network bioinspired attention system for selective attention through object motion sensitivity. The system generates events via fixational eye movements using a Dynamic Vision Sensor integrated into the Speck neuromorphic hardware, mounted on a Pan-Tilt unit, to identify the ROI and saccade toward it. The system, characterized using ideal gratings and benchmarked against the Event Camera Motion Segmentation Dataset, reaches a mean IoU of 82.2% and a mean SSIM of 96% in multi-object motion segmentation. The detection of salient objects reaches 88.8% accuracy in office scenarios and 89.8% in low-light conditions on the Event-Assisted Low-Light Video Object Segmentation Dataset. A real-time demonstrator shows the system's 0.12 s response to dynamic scenes. Its learning-free design ensures robustness across perceptual scenes, making it a reliable foundation for real-time robotic applications serving as a basis for more complex architectures.</description>

Abstract: Advances in foundation modeling have reshaped computational pathology. However, the increasing number of available models and lack of standardized benchmarks make it increasingly complex to assess their strengths, limitations, and potential for further development. To address these challenges, we introduce a new suite of software tools for whole-slide image processing, foundation model benchmarking, and curated publicly available tasks. We anticipate that these resources will promote transparency, reproducibility, and continued progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders for Scientifically Rigorous Interpretation of Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V.</description>

      <title>SAMRefiner: Taming Segment Anything Model for Universal Mask Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a principal way to enhance the quality of widely pre-existing coarse masks, enabling them to serve as reliable training data for segmentation models to reduce the annotation cost. In contrast to prior refinement techniques that are tailored to specific models or tasks in a close-world manner, we propose SAMRefiner, a universal and efficient approach by adapting SAM to the mask refinement task. The core technique of our model is the noise-tolerant prompting scheme. Specifically, we introduce a multi-prompt excavation strategy to mine diverse input prompts for SAM (i.e., distance-guided points, context-aware elastic bounding boxes, and Gaussian-style masks) from initial coarse masks. These prompts can collaborate with each other to mitigate the effect of defects in coarse masks. In particular, considering the difficulty of SAM to handle the multi-object case in semantic segmentation, we introduce a split-then-merge (STM) pipeline. Additionally, we extend our method to SAMRefiner++ by introducing an additional IoU adaption step to further boost the performance of the generic SAMRefiner on the target dataset. This step is self-boosted and requires no additional annotation. The proposed framework is versatile and can flexibly cooperate with existing segmentation methods. We evaluate our mask framework on a wide range of benchmarks under different settings, demonstrating better accuracy and efficiency. SAMRefiner holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of refinement tools. Our code is available at https://github.com/linyq2117/SAMRefiner.</description>

      <title>KARST: Multi-Kernel Kronecker Adaptation with Re-Scaling Transmission for Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision models for specific tasks is a common practice in computer vision. However, this process becomes more expensive as models grow larger. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a popular solution to improve training efficiency and reduce storage needs by tuning additional low-rank modules within pre-trained backbones. Despite their advantages, they struggle with limited representation capabilities and misalignment with pre-trained intermediate features. To address these issues, we introduce an innovative Multi-Kernel Kronecker Adaptation with Re-Scaling Transmission (KARST) for various recognition tasks. Specifically, its multi-kernel design extends Kronecker projections horizontally and separates adaptation matrices into multiple complementary spaces, reducing parameter dependency and creating more compact subspaces. Besides, it incorporates extra learnable re-scaling factors to better align with pre-trained feature distributions, allowing for more flexible and balanced feature aggregation. Extensive experiments validate that our KARST outperforms other PEFT counterparts with a negligible inference cost due to its re-parameterization characteristics. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucenova/KARST.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements have established Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) as a dominant framework in generative modeling. Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos.

      <title>Visual Agentic AI for Spatial Reasoning with a Dynamic API</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual reasoning -- the ability to interpret the visual world -- is crucial for embodied agents that operate within three-dimensional scenes. Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

      <title>EVEv2: Improved Baselines for Encoder-Free Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing encoder-free vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly narrowing the performance gap with their encoder-based counterparts, highlighting the promising potential for unified multimodal systems with structural simplicity and efficient deployment. We systematically clarify the performance gap between VLMs using pre-trained vision encoders, discrete tokenizers, and minimalist visual layers from scratch, deeply excavating the under-examined characteristics of encoder-free VLMs. We develop efficient strategies for encoder-free VLMs that rival mainstream encoder-based ones. After an in-depth investigation, we launch EVEv2.0, a new and improved family of encoder-free VLMs. We show that: (i) Properly decomposing and hierarchically associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities. (ii) A well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs. Through extensive evaluation, our EVEv2.0 represents a thorough study for developing a decoder-only architecture across modalities, demonstrating superior data efficiency and strong vision-reasoning capability.

      <title>Adversarial Machine Learning: Attacking and Safeguarding Image Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the vulnerabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adversarial attacks and explores a method for their safeguarding. In this study, CNNs were implemented on four of the most common image datasets, namely CIFAR-10, ImageNet, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, and achieved high baseline accuracy. To assess the strength of these models, the Fast Gradient Sign Method was used, which is a type of exploit on the model that is used to bring down the models accuracies by adding a very minimal perturbation to the input image. To counter the FGSM attack, a safeguarding approach went through, which includes retraining the models on clear and pollutant or adversarial images to increase their resistance ability. The next step involves applying FGSM again, but this time to the adversarially trained models, to see how much the accuracy of the models has gone down and evaluate the effectiveness of the defense. It appears that while most level of robustness is achieved against the models after adversarial training, there are still a few losses in the performance of these models against adversarial perturbations. This work emphasizes the need to create better defenses for models deployed in real-world scenarios against adversaries.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</description>

      <title>CoRPA: Adversarial Image Generation for Chest X-rays Using Concept Vector Perturbations and Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image classification tasks are becoming widely implemented in AI-assisted diagnostic tools, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinician workloads, and improve patient outcomes. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</description>

      <title>SEER: Self-Explainability Enhancement of Large Language Models' Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining the hidden representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a perspective to understand LLMs' underlying inference logic and improve their reliability in application scenarios. However, previous methods introduce external ''black-box'' modules to explain ''black-box'' LLMs, increasing the potential uncertainty and failing to provide faithful explanations. In this paper, we propose a self-explaining method SEER, enhancing LLMs' explainability by aggregating the same concept and disentangling the different concepts in the representation space. In this way, SEER provides faithful explanations carried by representations synchronously with the LLMs' output. Additionally, we showcase the applications of SEER on trustworthiness-related tasks (e.g., the safety risks classification and detoxification tasks), where self-explained LLMs achieve consistent improvement in explainability and performance. More crucially, we theoretically analyze the improvement of SEER on LLMs' generalization ability through optimal transport theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Segmentation of Aortic Branches and Zones in Computed Tomography Angiography: The AortaSeg24 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-class segmentation of the aorta in computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans is essential for diagnosing and planning complex endovascular treatments for patients with aortic dissections. However, existing methods reduce aortic segmentation to a binary problem, limiting their ability to measure diameters across different branches and zones. Furthermore, no open-source dataset is currently available to support the development of multi-class aortic segmentation methods. To address this gap, we organized the AortaSeg24 MICCAI Challenge, introducing the first dataset of 100 CTA volumes annotated for 23 clinically relevant aortic branches and zones. This dataset was designed to facilitate both model development and validation. The challenge attracted 121 teams worldwide, with participants leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks such as nnU-Net and exploring novel techniques, including cascaded models, data augmentation strategies, and custom loss functions. We evaluated the submitted algorithms using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), highlighting the approaches adopted by the top five performing teams. This paper presents the challenge design, dataset details, evaluation metrics, and an in-depth analysis of the top-performing algorithms. The annotated dataset, evaluation code, and implementations of the leading methods are publicly available to support further research.

      <title>A Novel Convolutional-Free Method for 3D Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmentation of 3D medical images is a critical task for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the field, achieving significant success in 3D medical image segmentation. However, CNNs struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and global context, limiting their performance, particularly for fine and complex structures. Recent transformer-based models, such as TransUNet and nnFormer, have demonstrated promise in addressing these limitations, though they still rely on hybrid CNN-transformer architectures. This paper introduces a novel, fully convolutional-free model based on transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach focuses on improving multi-semantic segmentation accuracy and addressing domain adaptation challenges between thick and thin slice CT images. We propose a joint loss function that facilitates effective segmentation of thin slices based on thick slice annotations, overcoming limitations in dataset availability. Furthermore, we present a benchmark dataset for multi-semantic segmentation on thin slices, addressing a gap in current medical imaging research. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional and hybrid architectures, offering new insights into the future of convolution-free medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis.

      <title>Unsupervised Self-Prior Embedding Neural Representation for Iterative Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging unsupervised implicit neural representation (INR) methods, such as NeRP, NeAT, and SCOPE, have shown great potential to address sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) inverse problems. Although these INR-based methods perform well in relatively dense SVCT reconstructions, they struggle to achieve comparable performance to supervised methods in sparser SVCT scenarios. They are prone to being affected by noise, limiting their applicability in real clinical settings. Additionally, current methods have not fully explored the use of image domain priors for solving SVCsT inverse problems. In this work, we demonstrate that imperfect reconstruction results can provide effective image domain priors for INRs to enhance performance. To leverage this, we introduce Self-prior embedding neural representation (Spener), a novel unsupervised method for SVCT reconstruction that integrates iterative reconstruction algorithms. During each iteration, Spener extracts local image prior features from the previous iteration and embeds them to constrain the solution space. Experimental results on multiple CT datasets show that our unsupervised Spener method achieves performance comparable to supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on in-domain data while outperforming them on out-of-domain datasets. Moreover, Spener significantly improves the performance of INR-based methods in handling SVCT with noisy sinograms. Our code is available at https://github.com/MeijiTian/Spener.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Magnetic Data using Learned Dictionaries and Scale Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer subsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field measurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by non-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional inversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological scenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable dictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our method employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of complex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined bases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating multi-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the progressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We implement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the latter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility. Using a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to conventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight the potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space dynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings underscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data inversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental assessment, and mineral prospecting.</description>

      <title>HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow inference APIs beyond foundation models. Specifically, we show that simulators -- such as computer graphics-based image synthesis tools -- can also serve as effective APIs within the PE framework. This insight greatly expands the applicability of PE, enabling the use of a wide variety of domain-specific simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore the potential of this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across three diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x and reducing the FID score by up to 80%. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within the PE framework to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating latent diffusion models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional constant bitrate streaming (CBS) and adaptive bitrate streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While it keeps B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to ensure efficient video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework is complemented with the most state-of-the-art denoising and video frame interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.</description>

      <title>4D VQ-GAN: Synthesising Medical Scans at Any Time Point for Personalised Disease Progression Modelling of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the progression trajectories of diseases is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This is especially vital for life-threatening conditions such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease with a prognosis comparable to many cancers. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been established as a reliable diagnostic tool for IPF. Accurately predicting future CT scans of early-stage IPF patients can aid in developing better treatment strategies, thereby improving survival outcomes. In this paper, we propose 4D Vector Quantised Generative Adversarial Networks (4D-VQ-GAN), a model capable of generating realistic CT volumes of IPF patients at any time point. The model is trained using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the second stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based temporal model is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings generated by the encoder in the first stage. We evaluate different configurations of our model for generating longitudinal CT scans and compare the results against ground truth data, both quantitatively and qualitatively. For validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived from generated CT scans and achieve a C-index comparable to that of biomarkers derived from the real CT scans. The survival analysis results demonstrate the potential clinical utility inherent to generated longitudinal CT scans, showing that they can reliably predict survival outcomes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Representation Dynamics of Diffusion Models via Low-Dimensional Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the critical question of why and when diffusion models, despite being designed for generative tasks, can excel at learning high-quality representations in a self-supervised manner. To address this, we develop a mathematical framework based on a low-dimensional data model and posterior estimation, revealing a fundamental trade-off between generation and representation quality near the final stage of image generation. Our analysis explains the unimodal representation dynamics across noise scales, mainly driven by the interplay between data denoising and class specification. Building on these insights, we propose an ensemble method that aggregates features across noise levels, significantly improving both clean performance and robustness under label noise. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our findings.</description>

      <title>PINGS: Gaussian Splatting Meets Distance Fields within a Point-Based Implicit Neural Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots require high-fidelity reconstructions of their environment for effective operation. Such scene representations should be both, geometrically accurate and photorealistic to support downstream tasks. While this can be achieved by building distance fields from range sensors and radiance fields from cameras, the scalable incremental mapping of both fields consistently and at the same time with high quality remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel map representation that unifies a continuous signed distance field and a Gaussian splatting radiance field within an elastic and compact point-based implicit neural map. By enforcing geometric consistency between these fields, we achieve mutual improvements by exploiting both modalities. We devise a LiDAR-visual SLAM system called PINGS using the proposed map representation and evaluate it on several challenging large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that PINGS can incrementally build globally consistent distance and radiance fields encoded with a compact set of neural points. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, PINGS achieves superior photometric and geometric rendering at novel views by leveraging the constraints from the distance field. Furthermore, by utilizing dense photometric cues and multi-view consistency from the radiance field, PINGS produces more accurate distance fields, leading to improved odometry estimation and mesh reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is an untreatable, progressive brain disorder that slowly robs people of their memory, thinking abilities, and ultimately their capacity to complete even the most basic tasks. Among older adults, it is the most frequent cause of dementia. Although there is presently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, scientific trials are ongoing to discover drugs to combat the condition. Treatments to slow the signs of dementia are also available. Many researchers throughout the world became interested in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems to aid in the early identification of this deadly disease and assure an accurate diagnosis. In particular, image based approaches have been coupled with machine learning techniques to address the challenges of Alzheimer's disease detection. This study proposes a computer aided diagnosis system to detect Alzheimer's disease from biomarkers captured using neuroimaging techniques. The proposed approach relies on deep learning techniques to extract the relevant visual features from the image collection to accurately predict the Alzheimer's class value. In the experiments, standard datasets and pre-trained deep learning models were investigated. Moreover, standard performance measures were used to assess the models' performances. The obtained results proved that VGG16-based models outperform the state of the art performance.</description>

      <title>Compressing Model with Few Class-Imbalance Samples: An Out-of-Distribution Expedition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, as a compromise between privacy and performance, few-sample model compression has been widely adopted to deal with limited data resulting from privacy and security concerns. However, when the number of available samples is extremely limited, class imbalance becomes a common and tricky problem. Achieving an equal number of samples across all classes is often costly and impractical in real-world applications, and previous studies on few-sample model compression have mostly ignored this significant issue. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate that class imbalance negatively affects the overall performance of few-sample model compression methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel and adaptive framework named OOD-Enhanced Few-Sample Model Compression (OE-FSMC). This framework integrates easily accessible out-of-distribution (OOD) data into both the compression and fine-tuning processes, effectively rebalancing the training distribution. We also incorporate a joint distillation loss and a regularization term to reduce the risk of the model overfitting to the OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our framework can be seamlessly incorporated into existing few-sample model compression methods, effectively mitigating the accuracy degradation caused by class imbalance.</description>

      <title>DexVLA: Vision-Language Model with Plug-In Diffusion Expert for General Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling robots to perform diverse tasks across varied environments is a central challenge in robot learning. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise for generalizable robot skills, realizing their full potential requires addressing limitations in action representation and efficient training. Current VLA models often focus on scaling the vision-language model (VLM) component, while the action space representation remains a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces DexVLA, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency and generalization capabilities of VLAs for complex, long-horizon tasks across diverse robot embodiments. DexVLA features a novel diffusion-based action expert, scaled to one billion parameters, designed for cross-embodiment learning. A novel embodiment curriculum learning strategy facilitates efficient training: (1) pre-training the diffusion expert that is separable from the VLA on cross-embodiment data, (2) aligning the VLA model to specific embodiments, and (3) post-training for rapid adaptation to new tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple embodiments, including single-arm, bimanual, and dexterous hand, demonstrating DexVLA's adaptability to challenging tasks without task-specific adaptation, its ability to learn dexterous skills on novel embodiments with limited data, and its capacity to complete complex, long-horizon tasks using only direct language prompting, such as laundry folding. In all settings, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like Octo, OpenVLA, and Diffusion Policy.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation model. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. Here, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We use the forward process of the diffusion model to add additional auxiliary observations and then perform an SMC sampling as part of the backward process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of our approach over competing methods on various inverse problem tasks.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Bidirectional Image-Report Understanding in Chest Radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked their potential for multimodal tasks, where text and visual data are processed jointly. However, applying LLMs to medical imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXR), poses significant challenges due to the need for precise visual-textual alignment and the preservation of critical diagnostic details. In this paper, we propose Multi-Stage Adaptive Vision-Language Tuning (MAViLT), a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation for CXR understanding. MAViLT incorporates a clinical gradient-weighted tokenization process and a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, enabling it to generate accurate radiology reports, synthesize realistic CXRs from text, and answer vision-based clinical questions. We evaluate MAViLT on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Indiana University CXR, achieving state-of-the-art results across all tasks. Human evaluations further validate the clinical relevance and utility of MAViLT, making it a robust tool for real-world medical applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for multimodal medical imaging while addressing key challenges in vision-language integration.</description>

      <title>Pencils to Pixels: A Systematic Study of Creative Drawings across Children, Adults and AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we derive computational metrics to quantify visual creativity in drawings across intelligent agents, while accounting for inherent differences in technical skill and style? To answer this, we curate a novel dataset consisting of 1338 drawings by children, adults and AI on a creative drawing task. We characterize two aspects of the drawings -- (1) style and (2) content. For style, we define measures of ink density, ink distribution and number of elements. For content, we use expert-annotated categories to study conceptual diversity, and image and text embeddings to compute distance measures. We compare the style, content and creativity of children, adults and AI drawings and build simple models to predict expert and automated creativity scores. We find significant differences in style and content in the groups -- children's drawings had more components, AI drawings had greater ink density, and adult drawings revealed maximum conceptual diversity. Notably, we highlight a misalignment between creativity judgments obtained through expert and automated ratings and discuss its implications. Through these efforts, our work provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first framework for studying human and artificial creativity beyond the textual modality, and attempts to arrive at the domain-agnostic principles underlying creativity. Our data and scripts are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Online Reward-Weighted Fine-Tuning of Flow Matching with Wasserstein Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved great success in fine-tuning diffusion-based generative models. However, fine-tuning continuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined reward functions remains challenging, particularly due to issues such as policy collapse from overoptimization and the prohibitively high computational cost of likelihoods in continuous-time flows. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use and theoretically sound RL fine-tuning method, which we term Online Reward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization (ORW-CFM-W2). Our method integrates RL into the flow matching framework to fine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions, without relying on gradients of rewards or filtered datasets. By introducing an online reward-weighting mechanism, our approach guides the model to prioritize high-reward regions in the data manifold. To prevent policy collapse and maintain diversity, we incorporate Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance regularization into our method and derive a tractable upper bound for it in flow matching, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation of policy optimization. We provide theoretical analyses to demonstrate the convergence properties and induced data distributions of our method, establishing connections with traditional RL algorithms featuring Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and learning behavior of our approach. Extensive experiments on tasks including target image generation, image compression, and text-image alignment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method achieves optimal policy convergence while allowing controllable trade-offs between reward maximization and diversity preservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By monitoring temporal contrast, event-based vision sensors can provide high temporal resolution and low latency while maintaining low power consumption and simplicity in circuit structure. These characteristics have garnered significant attention in both academia and industry. In recent years, the application of back-illuminated (BSI) technology, wafer stacking techniques, and industrial interfaces has brought new opportunities for enhancing the performance of event-based vision sensors. This is evident in the substantial advancements made in reducing noise, improving resolution, and increasing readout rates. Additionally, the integration of these technologies has enhanced the compatibility of event-based vision sensors with current and edge vision systems, providing greater possibilities for their practical applications. This paper will review the progression from neuromorphic engineering to state-of-the-art event-based vision sensor technologies, including their development trends, operating principles, and key features. Moreover, we will delve into the sensitivity of event-based vision sensors and the opportunities and challenges they face in the realm of infrared imaging, providing references for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Botnet Attacks Detection in IoT Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberattacks in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment can have significant impacts because of the interconnected nature of devices and systems. An attacker uses a network of compromised IoT devices in a botnet attack to carry out various harmful activities. Detecting botnet attacks poses several challenges because of the intricate and evolving nature of these threats. Botnet attacks erode trust in IoT devices and systems, undermining confidence in their security, reliability, and integrity. Deep learning techniques have significantly enhanced the detection of botnet attacks due to their ability to analyze and learn from complex patterns in data. This research proposed the stacking of Deep convolutional neural networks, Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for botnet attacks detection. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is utilized for botnet attacks detection. According to experimental results, the proposed model accurately provides for the intricate patterns and features of botnet attacks, with a testing accuracy of 99.76%. The proposed model also identifies botnets with a high ROC-AUC curve value of 99.18%. A performance comparison of the proposed method with existing state-of-the-art models confirms its higher performance. The outcomes of this research could strengthen cyber security procedures and safeguard against new attacks.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Visual Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of transformer-based foundation models, extending our analysis to include Visual Autoregressive (VAR) transformers. VAR represents a big step toward generating images using a novel, scalable, coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' framework. These models set a new quality bar, outperforming all previous methods, including Diffusion Transformers, while having state-of-the-art performance for image synthesis tasks. Our primary contributions establish that, for single-head VAR transformers with a single self-attention layer and single interpolation layer, the VAR Transformer is universal. From the statistical perspective, we prove that such simple VAR transformers are universal approximators for any image-to-image Lipschitz functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that flow-based autoregressive transformers inherit similar approximation capabilities. Our results provide important design principles for effective and computationally efficient VAR Transformer strategies that can be used to extend their utility to more sophisticated VAR models in image generation and other related areas.</description>

      <title>A Data-Efficient Pan-Tumor Foundation Model for Oncology CT Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-assisted imaging analysis has made substantial strides in tumor diagnosis and management. Here we present PASTA, a pan-tumor CT foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 representative oncology tasks -- including lesion segmentation, tumor detection in plain CT, tumor staging, survival prediction, structured report generation, and cross-modality transfer learning, significantly outperforming the second-best models on 35 tasks. This remarkable advancement is driven by our development of PASTA-Gen, an innovative synthetic tumor generation framework that produces a comprehensive dataset of 30,000 CT scans with pixel-level annotated lesions and paired structured reports, encompassing malignancies across ten organs and five benign lesion types. By leveraging this rich, high-quality synthetic data, we overcome a longstanding bottleneck in the development of CT foundation models -- specifically, the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality annotated datasets due to privacy constraints and the substantial labor required for scaling precise data annotation. Encouragingly, PASTA demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with promising practical value, markedly improving performance on various tasks with only a small amount of real-world data. The open release of both the synthetic dataset and PASTA foundation model effectively addresses the challenge of data scarcity, thereby advancing oncological research and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cost Efficiency in Active Learning with Candidate Set Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-efficient active learning (AL) framework for classification, featuring a novel query design called candidate set query. Unlike traditional AL queries requiring the oracle to examine all possible classes, our method narrows down the set of candidate classes likely to include the ground-truth class, significantly reducing the search space and labeling cost. Moreover, we leverage conformal prediction to dynamically generate small yet reliable candidate sets, adapting to model enhancement over successive AL rounds. To this end, we introduce an acquisition function designed to prioritize data points that offer high information gain at lower cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. Notably, it reduces labeling cost by 42% on ImageNet64x64.</description>

      <title>Is an Ultra Large Natural Image-Based Foundation Model Superior to a Retina-Specific Model for Detecting Ocular and Systemic Diseases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) is transforming medical domain. In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P&lt;=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P&lt;0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P&lt;0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P&lt;0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</description>

      <title>From Pixels to Components: Eigenvector Masking for Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting masked from visible parts of an image is a powerful self-supervised approach for visual representation learning. However, the common practice of masking random patches of pixels exhibits certain failure modes, which can prevent learning meaningful high-level features, as required for downstream tasks. We propose an alternative masking strategy that operates on a suitable transformation of the data rather than on the raw pixels. Specifically, we perform principal component analysis and then randomly mask a subset of components, which accounts for a fixed ratio of the data variance. The learning task then amounts to reconstructing the masked components from the visible ones. Compared to local patches of pixels, the principal components of images carry more global information. We thus posit that predicting masked from visible components involves more high-level features, allowing our masking strategy to extract more useful representations. This is corroborated by our empirical findings which demonstrate improved image classification performance for component over pixel masking. Our method thus constitutes a simple and robust data-driven alternative to traditional masked image modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Many-Task Federated Fine-Tuning via Unified Task Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) traditionally assumes homogeneous client tasks; however, in real-world scenarios, clients often specialize in diverse tasks, introducing task heterogeneity. To address this challenge, Many-Task FL (MaT-FL) has emerged, enabling clients to collaborate effectively despite task diversity. Existing MaT-FL approaches rely on client grouping or personalized layers, requiring the server to manage individual models and failing to account for clients handling multiple tasks. We propose MaTU, a MaT-FL approach that enables joint learning of task vectors across clients, eliminating the need for clustering or client-specific weight storage at the server. Our method introduces a novel aggregation mechanism that determines task similarity based on the direction of clients task vectors and constructs a unified task vector encapsulating all tasks. To address task-specific requirements, we augment the unified task vector with lightweight modulators that facilitate knowledge transfer among related tasks while disentangling dissimilar ones. Evaluated across 30 datasets, MaTU achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art MaT-FL approaches, with results comparable to per-task fine-tuning, while delivering significant communication savings.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informative representations enhance model performance and generalisability in downstream tasks. However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</description>

      <title>Boost-and-Skip: A Simple Guidance-Free Diffusion for Minority Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minority samples are underrepresented instances located in low-density regions of a data manifold, and are valuable in many generative AI applications, such as data augmentation, creative content generation, etc. Unfortunately, existing diffusion-based minority generators often rely on computationally expensive guidance dedicated for minority generation. To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.</description>

      <title>SIREN: Semantic, Initialization-Free Registration of Multi-Robot Gaussian Splatting Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SIREN for registration of multi-robot Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) maps, with zero access to camera poses, images, and inter-map transforms for initialization or fusion of local submaps. To realize these capabilities, SIREN harnesses the versatility and robustness of semantics in three critical ways to derive a rigorous registration pipeline for multi-robot GSplat maps. First, SIREN utilizes semantics to identify feature-rich regions of the local maps where the registration problem is better posed, eliminating the need for any initialization which is generally required in prior work. Second, SIREN identifies candidate correspondences between Gaussians in the local maps using robust semantic features, constituting the foundation for robust geometric optimization, coarsely aligning 3D Gaussian primitives extracted from the local maps. Third, this key step enables subsequent photometric refinement of the transformation between the submaps, where SIREN leverages novel-view synthesis in GSplat maps along with a semantics-based image filter to compute a high-accuracy non-rigid transformation for the generation of a high-fidelity fused map. We demonstrate the superior performance of SIREN compared to competing baselines across a range of real-world datasets, and in particular, across the most widely-used robot hardware platforms, including a manipulator, drone, and quadruped. In our experiments, SIREN achieves about 90x smaller rotation errors, 300x smaller translation errors, and 44x smaller scale errors in the most challenging scenes, where competing methods struggle. We will release the code and provide a link to the project page after the review process.</description>

Abstract: In continual learning, understanding the properties of task sequences and their relationships to model performance is important for developing advanced algorithms with better accuracy. However, efforts in this direction remain underdeveloped despite encouraging progress in methodology development. In this work, we investigate the impacts of sequence transferability on continual learning and propose two novel measures that capture the total transferability of a task sequence, either in the forward or backward direction. Based on the empirical properties of these measures, we then develop a new method for the task order selection problem in continual learning. Our method can be shown to offer a better performance than the conventional strategy of random task selection.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Video Analytics in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data has driven the development of distributed video analytics in cloud-edge-terminal collaborative (CETC) systems, enabling efficient video processing, real-time inference, and privacy-preserving analysis. Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent developing trend in clustering is the advancement of algorithms that not only identify clusters within data, but also express and capture the uncertainty of cluster membership. Evidential clustering addresses this by using the Dempster-Shafer theory of belief functions, a framework designed to manage and represent uncertainty. This approach results in a credal partition, a structured set of mass functions that quantify the uncertain assignment of each object to potential groups. The Python framework evclust, presented in this paper, offers a suite of efficient evidence clustering algorithms as well as tools for visualizing, evaluating and analyzing credal partitions.</description>

      <title>History-Guided Video Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos.

      <title>Investigating Prompting Techniques for Zero- and Few-Shot Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore effective prompting techniques to enhance zero- and few-shot Visual Question Answering (VQA) performance in contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Central to our investigation is the role of question templates in guiding VLMs to generate accurate answers. We identify that specific templates significantly influence VQA outcomes, underscoring the need for strategic template selection. Another pivotal aspect of our study is augmenting VLMs with image captions, providing them with additional visual cues alongside direct image features in VQA tasks. Surprisingly, this augmentation significantly improves the VLMs' performance in many cases, even though VLMs "see" the image directly! We explore chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and find that while standard CoT reasoning causes drops in performance, advanced methods like self-consistency can help recover it. Furthermore, we find that text-only few-shot examples enhance VLMs' alignment with the task format, particularly benefiting models prone to verbose zero-shot answers. Lastly, to mitigate the challenges associated with evaluating free-form open-ended VQA responses using string-matching based VQA metrics, we introduce a straightforward LLM-guided pre-processing technique to adapt the model responses to the expected ground-truth answer distribution. In summary, our research sheds light on the intricacies of prompting strategies in VLMs for VQA, emphasizing the synergistic use of captions, templates, and pre-processing to enhance model efficacy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Generation of Privileged Intermediate Information for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification seeks to retrieve images of the same individual captured over a distributed network of RGB and IR sensors. Several V-I ReID approaches directly integrate both V and I modalities to discriminate persons within a shared representation space. However, given the significant gap in data distributions between V and I modalities, cross-modal V-I ReID remains challenging. Some recent approaches improve generalization by leveraging intermediate spaces that can bridge V and I modalities, yet effective methods are required to select or generate data for such informative domains. In this paper, the Adaptive Generation of Privileged Intermediate Information training approach is introduced to adapt and generate a virtual domain that bridges discriminant information between the V and I modalities. The key motivation behind AGPI^2 is to enhance the training of a deep V-I ReID backbone by generating privileged images that provide additional information. These privileged images capture shared discriminative features that are not easily accessible within the original V or I modalities alone. Towards this goal, a non-linear generative module is trained with an adversarial objective, translating V images into intermediate spaces with a smaller domain shift w.r.t. the I domain. Meanwhile, the embedding module within AGPI^2 aims to produce similar features for both V and generated images, encouraging the extraction of features that are common to all modalities. In addition to these contributions, AGPI^2 employs adversarial objectives for adapting the intermediate images, which play a crucial role in creating a non-modality-specific space to address the large domain shifts between V and I domains. Experimental results conducted on challenging V-I ReID datasets indicate that AGPI^2 increases matching accuracy without extra computational resources during inference.</description>

      <title>Linear Alignment of Vision-language Models for Image Captioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, vision-language models like CLIP have advanced the state of the art in a variety of multi-modal tasks including image captioning and caption evaluation. Many approaches leverage CLIP for cross-modal retrieval to condition pre-trained language models on visual input. However, CLIP generally suffers from a mis-alignment of image and text modalities in the joint embedding space. We investigate efficient methods to linearly re-align the joint embedding space for the downstream task of image captioning. This leads to an efficient training protocol that merely requires computing a closed-form solution for a linear mapping in the joint CLIP space. Consequently, we propose a lightweight captioning method called ReCap, which can be trained up to 1000 times faster than existing lightweight methods. Moreover, we propose two new learning-based image-captioning metrics built on CLIP score along with our proposed alignment. We evaluate ReCap on MS-COCO, Flickr30k, VizWiz and MSRVTT. On the former two, ReCap performs comparably to state-of-the-art lightweight methods using rule-based metrics while outperforming them on most of the CLIP-based metrics. On the latter two benchmarks, ReCap consistently outperforms competitors across all metrics and exhibits strong transfer capabilities and resilience to noise. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics correlate stronger with human judgement than existing metrics on the Flickr8k-Expert, Flickr8k-Crowdflower, and THumB datasets.</description>

      <title>Progressive Feedback-Enhanced Transformer for Image Forgery Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blind detection of the forged regions in digital images is an effective authentication means to counter the malicious use of local image editing techniques. Existing encoder-decoder forensic networks overlook the fact that detecting complex and subtle tampered regions typically requires more feedback information. In this paper, we propose a Progressive FeedbACk-enhanced Transformer (ProFact) network to achieve coarse-to-fine image forgery localization. Specifically, the coarse localization map generated by an initial branch network is adaptively fed back to the early transformer encoder layers, which can enhance the representation of positive features while suppressing interference factors. The cascaded transformer network, combined with a contextual spatial pyramid module, is designed to refine discriminative forensic features for improving the forgery localization accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, we present an effective strategy to automatically generate large-scale forged image samples close to real-world forensic scenarios, especially in realistic and coherent processing. Leveraging on such samples, a progressive and cost-effective two-stage training protocol is applied to the ProFact network. The extensive experimental results on nine public forensic datasets show that our proposed localizer greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the generalization ability and robustness of image forgery localization. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/ProFact.</description>

      <title>Multitask Learning in Minimally Invasive Surgical Vision: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized many procedures and led to reduced recovery time and risk of patient injury. However, MIS poses additional complexity and burden on surgical teams. Data-driven surgical vision algorithms are thought to be key building blocks in the development of future MIS systems with improved autonomy. Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have led to successful applications in analyzing videos obtained from MIS with the promise of alleviating challenges in MIS videos. Surgical scene and action understanding encompasses multiple related tasks that, when solved individually, can be memory-intensive, inefficient, and fail to capture task relationships. Multitask learning (MTL), a learning paradigm that leverages information from multiple related tasks to improve performance and aid generalization, is well suited for fine-grained and high-level understanding of MIS data. This review provides a narrative overview of the current state-of-the-art MTL systems that leverage videos obtained from MIS. Beyond listing published approaches, we discuss the benefits and limitations of these MTL systems. Moreover, this manuscript presents an analysis of the literature for various application fields of MTL in MIS, including those with large models, highlighting notable trends, new directions of research, and developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a seminal approach for synthesizing images from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) in through-wall scenarios. Leveraging the strengths of WiFi, such as cost-effectiveness, illumination invariance, and wall-penetrating capabilities, our approach enables visual monitoring of indoor environments beyond room boundaries and without the need for cameras. More generally, it improves the interpretability of WiFi CSI by unlocking the option to perform image-based downstream tasks, e.g., visual activity recognition. In order to achieve this crossmodal translation from WiFi CSI to images, we rely on a multimodal Variational Autoencoder (VAE) adapted to our problem specifics. We extensively evaluate our proposed methodology through an ablation study on architecture configuration and a quantitative/qualitative assessment of reconstructed images. Our results demonstrate the viability of our method and highlight its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>SPAFormer: Sequential 3D Part Assembly with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SPAFormer, an innovative model designed to overcome the combinatorial explosion challenge in the 3D Part Assembly (3D-PA) task. This task requires accurate prediction of each part's poses in sequential steps. As the number of parts increases, the possible assembly combinations increase exponentially, leading to a combinatorial explosion that severely hinders the efficacy of 3D-PA. SPAFormer addresses this problem by leveraging weak constraints from assembly sequences, effectively reducing the solution space's complexity. Since the sequence of parts conveys construction rules similar to sentences structured through words, our model explores both parallel and autoregressive generation. We further strengthen SPAFormer through knowledge enhancement strategies that utilize the attributes of parts and their sequence information, enabling it to capture the inherent assembly pattern and relationships among sequentially ordered parts. We also construct a more challenging benchmark named PartNet-Assembly covering 21 varied categories to more comprehensively validate the effectiveness of SPAFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of SPAFormer, particularly with multi-tasking and in scenarios requiring long-horizon assembly.

      <title>Controllable Text-to-3D Generation via Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation tasks have received considerable attention, one important but under-explored field between them is controllable text-to-3D generation, which we mainly focus on in this work. To address this task, 1) we introduce Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl), a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by integrating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. Our innovation lies in the introduction of a conditioning module that controls the base diffusion model using both local and global embeddings, which are computed from the input condition images and camera poses. Once trained, MVControl is able to offer 3D diffusion guidance for optimization-based 3D generation. And, 2) we propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages the benefits of recent large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithm. Building upon our MVControl architecture, we employ a unique hybrid diffusion guidance method to direct the optimization process. In pursuit of efficiency, we adopt 3D Gaussians as our representation instead of the commonly used implicit representations. We also pioneer the use of SuGaR, a hybrid representation that binds Gaussians to mesh triangle faces. This approach alleviates the issue of poor geometry in 3D Gaussians and enables the direct sculpting of fine-grained geometry on the mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalization and enables the controllable generation of high-quality 3D content.

      <title>Bidirectional Multi-Step Domain Generalization for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key challenge in visible-infrared person re-identification (V-I ReID) is training a backbone model capable of effectively addressing the significant discrepancies across modalities. State-of-the-art methods that generate a single intermediate bridging domain are often less effective, as this generated domain may not adequately capture sufficient common discriminant information. This paper introduces Bidirectional Multi-step Domain Generalization (BMDG), a novel approach for unifying feature representations across diverse modalities. BMDG creates multiple virtual intermediate domains by learning and aligning body part features extracted from both I and V modalities. In particular, our method aims to minimize the cross-modal gap in two steps. First, BMDG aligns modalities in the feature space by learning shared and modality-invariant body part prototypes from V and I images. Then, it generalizes the feature representation by applying bidirectional multi-step learning, which progressively refines feature representations in each step and incorporates more prototypes from both modalities. Based on these prototypes, multiple bridging steps enhance the feature representation. Experiments conducted on V-I ReID datasets indicate that our BMDG approach can outperform state-of-the-art part-based and intermediate generation methods, and can be integrated into other part-based methods to enhance their V-I ReID performance.

      <title>A Lightweight Attention-based Deep Network via Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Multi-View Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their variations have shown effectiveness in facial expression recognition (FER). However, they face challenges when dealing with high computational complexity and multi-view head poses in real-world scenarios. We introduce a lightweight attentional network incorporating multi-scale feature fusion (LANMSFF) to tackle these issues. For the first challenge, we carefully design a lightweight network. We address the second challenge by presenting two novel components, namely mass attention (MassAtt) and point wise feature selection (PWFS) blocks. The MassAtt block simultaneously generates channel and spatial attention maps to recalibrate feature maps by emphasizing important features while suppressing irrelevant ones. In addition, the PWFS block employs a feature selection mechanism that discards less meaningful features prior to the fusion process. This mechanism distinguishes it from previous methods that directly fuse multi-scale features. Our proposed approach achieved results comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of parameter count and robustness to pose variation, with accuracy rates of 90.77% on KDEF, 70.44% on FER-2013, and 86.96% on FERPlus datasets. The code for LANMSFF is available at https://github.com/AE-1129/LANMSFF.</description>

      <title>MaeFuse: Transferring Omni Features with Pretrained Masked Autoencoders for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion via Guided Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MaeFuse, a novel autoencoder model designed for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF). The existing approaches for image fusion often rely on training combined with downstream tasks to obtain highlevel visual information, which is effective in emphasizing target objects and delivering impressive results in visual quality and task-specific applications. Instead of being driven by downstream tasks, our model called MaeFuse utilizes a pretrained encoder from Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which facilities the omni features extraction for low-level reconstruction and high-level vision tasks, to obtain perception friendly features with a low cost. In order to eliminate the domain gap of different modal features and the block effect caused by the MAE encoder, we further develop a guided training strategy. This strategy is meticulously crafted to ensure that the fusion layer seamlessly adjusts to the feature space of the encoder, gradually enhancing the fusion performance. The proposed method can facilitate the comprehensive integration of feature vectors from both infrared and visible modalities, thus preserving the rich details inherent in each modal. MaeFuse not only introduces a novel perspective in the realm of fusion techniques but also stands out with impressive performance across various public datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, the pioneering work TypeNet showed that keystroke dynamics verification could scale to hundreds of thousands of users with minimal performance degradation. Recently, the KVC-onGoing competition has provided an open and robust experimental protocol for evaluating keystroke dynamics verification systems of such scale. %, including considerations of algorithmic fairness. This article describes Type2Branch, the model and techniques that achieved the lowest error rates at the KVC-onGoing, in both desktop and mobile typing scenarios. The novelty aspects of the proposed Type2Branch include: i) synthesized timing features emphasizing user behavior deviation from the general population, ii) a dual-branch architecture combining recurrent and convolutional paths with various attention mechanisms, iii) a new loss function named Set2set that captures the global structure of the embedding space, and iv) a training curriculum of increasing difficulty. Considering five enrollment samples per subject of approximately 50 characters typed, the proposed Type2Branch achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean per-subject Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 0.77% and 1.03% on evaluation sets of respectively 15,000 and 5,000 subjects for desktop and mobile scenarios. With a fixed global threshold for all subjects, the EERs are respectively 3.25% and 3.61% for desktop and mobile scenarios, outperforming previous approaches by a significant margin. The source code for dataset generation, model, and training process is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Learning Invariant Causal Mechanism from Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable success, but its performance can degrade when fine-tuned in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We model the prediction process using a Structural Causal Model (SCM) and show that the causal mechanism involving both invariant and variant factors in training environments differs from that in test environments. In contrast, the causal mechanism with solely invariant factors remains consistent across environments. We theoretically prove the existence of a linear mapping from CLIP embeddings to invariant factors, which can be estimated using interventional data. Additionally, we provide a condition to guarantee low OOD risk of the invariant predictor. Based on these insights, we propose the Invariant Causal Mechanism of CLIP (CLIP-ICM) framework. CLIP-ICM involves collecting interventional data, estimating a linear projection matrix, and making predictions within the invariant subspace. Experiments on several OOD datasets show that CLIP-ICM significantly improves the performance of CLIP. Our method offers a simple but powerful enhancement, boosting the reliability of CLIP in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision Language Models via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15973v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in visual question-answering and reasoning tasks through vision instruction tuning on specific datasets. However, there remains significant room for improvement in aligning visual and language modalities. Existing methods often depend on external models or data, leading to uncontrollable and unstable alignment results. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a self-improvement framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment without external dependencies. SIMA leverages existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses, incorporating an in-context self-critic mechanism that constructs preference pairs for tuning. Crucially, our approach allows LVLMs to act as critics by designing effective critic prompts, eliminating the need for additional fine-tuning with external instruction data. We introduce three novel visual metrics within the self-critic process to guide judgment, significantly improving the accuracy of self-critic. Through extensive experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA significantly improves LVLM's performance and outperforms previous approaches, achieving superior modality alignment.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, particularly in concept reasoning. However, their applications in understanding 3D environments remain limited, primarily offering textual or numerical outputs without generating dense, informative segmentation masks. This paper introduces Reason3D, a novel LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding. Reason3D processes point cloud data and text prompts to produce textual responses and segmentation masks, enabling advanced tasks such as 3D reasoning segmentation, hierarchical searching, express referring, and question answering with detailed mask outputs. We propose a hierarchical mask decoder that employs a coarse-to-fine approach to segment objects within expansive scenes. It begins with a coarse location estimation, followed by object mask estimation, using two unique tokens predicted by LLMs based on the textual query. Experimental results on large-scale ScanNet and Matterport3D datasets validate the effectiveness of our Reason3D across various tasks.</description>

      <title>How Culturally Aware are Vision-Language Models?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An image is often considered worth a thousand words, and certain images can tell rich and insightful stories. Can these stories be told via image captioning? Images from folklore genres, such as mythology, folk dance, cultural signs, and symbols, are vital to every culture. Our research compares the performance of four popular vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro Vision, LLaVA, and OpenFlamingo) in identifying culturally specific information in such images and creating accurate and culturally sensitive image captions. We also propose a new evaluation metric, the Cultural Awareness Score (CAS), which measures the degree of cultural awareness in image captions. We provide a dataset MOSAIC-1.5k labeled with ground truth for images containing cultural background and context and a labeled dataset with assigned Cultural Awareness Scores that can be used with unseen data. Creating culturally appropriate image captions is valuable for scientific research and can be beneficial for many practical applications. We envision our work will promote a deeper integration of cultural sensitivity in AI applications worldwide. By making the dataset and Cultural Awareness Score available to the public, we aim to facilitate further research in this area, encouraging the development of more culturally aware AI systems that respect and celebrate global diversity.</description>

      <title>Distribution Aligned Semantics Adaption for Lifelong Person Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) systems need to be adaptable to changes in space and time. Therefore, the adaptation of Re-ID models to new domains while preserving previously acquired knowledge is crucial, known as Lifelong person Re-IDentification (LReID). Advanced LReID methods rely on replaying exemplars from old domains and applying knowledge distillation in logits with old models. However, due to privacy concerns, retaining previous data is inappropriate. Additionally, the fine-grained and open-set characteristics of Re-ID limit the effectiveness of the distillation paradigm for accumulating knowledge. We argue that a Re-ID model trained on diverse and challenging pedestrian images at a large scale can acquire robust and general human semantic knowledge. These semantics can be readily utilized as shared knowledge for lifelong applications. In this paper, we identify the challenges and discrepancies associated with adapting a pre-trained model to each application domain and introduce the Distribution Aligned Semantics Adaption (DASA) framework. It efficiently adjusts Batch Normalization (BN) to mitigate interference from data distribution discrepancy and freezes the pre-trained convolutional layers to preserve shared knowledge. Additionally, we propose the lightweight Semantics Adaption (SA) module, which effectively adapts learned semantics to enhance pedestrian representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable superiority of our proposed framework over advanced LReID methods, and it exhibits significantly reduced storage consumption. DASA presents a novel and cost-effective perspective on effectively adapting pre-trained models for LReID. The code is available at https://github.com/QizaoWang/DASA-LReID.</description>

      <title>Guided Score identity Distillation for Data-Free One-Step Text-to-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have demonstrated the ability to produce photorealistic images aligned with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Notably, the one-step distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves an FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, a record low value under the data-free setting. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.</description>

      <title>Progressive Confident Masking Attention Network for Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio and visual signals typically occur simultaneously, and humans possess an innate ability to correlate and synchronize information from these two modalities. Recently, a challenging problem known as Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) has emerged, intending to produce segmentation maps for sounding objects within a scene. However, the methods proposed so far have not sufficiently integrated audio and visual information, and the computational costs have been extremely high. Additionally, the outputs of different stages have not been fully utilized. To facilitate this research, we introduce a novel Progressive Confident Masking Attention Network (PMCANet). It leverages attention mechanisms to uncover the intrinsic correlations between audio signals and visual frames. Furthermore, we design an efficient and effective cross-attention module to enhance semantic perception by selecting query tokens. This selection is determined through confidence-driven units based on the network's multi-stage predictive outputs. Experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms other AVS methods while requiring less computational resources. The code is available at: https://github.com/PrettyPlate/PCMANet.</description>

      <title>Not All Prompts Are Made Equal: Prompt-based Pruning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive image generation capabilities. Still, their computational intensity prohibits resource-constrained organizations from deploying T2I models after fine-tuning them on their internal target data. While pruning techniques offer a potential solution to reduce the computational burden of T2I models, static pruning methods use the same pruned model for all input prompts, overlooking the varying capacity requirements of different prompts. Dynamic pruning addresses this issue by utilizing a separate sub-network for each prompt, but it prevents batch parallelism on GPUs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Adaptive Prompt-Tailored Pruning (APTP), a novel prompt-based pruning method designed for T2I diffusion models. Central to our approach is a prompt router model, which learns to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. Each architecture code represents a specialized model tailored to the prompts assigned to it, and the number of codes is a hyperparameter. We train the prompt router and architecture codes using contrastive learning, ensuring that similar prompts are mapped to nearby codes. Further, we employ optimal transport to prevent the codes from collapsing into a single one. We demonstrate APTP's effectiveness by pruning Stable Diffusion (SD) V2.1 using CC3M and COCO as target datasets. APTP outperforms the single-model pruning baselines in terms of FID, CLIP, and CMMD scores. Our analysis of the clusters learned by APTP reveals they are semantically meaningful. We also show that APTP can automatically discover previously empirically found challenging prompts for SD, e.g. prompts for generating text images, assigning them to higher capacity codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) leverage sparse spikes to represent information and process them in an asynchronous event-driven manner, offering an energy-efficient paradigm for the next generation of machine intelligence. However, the current focus within the SNN community prioritizes accuracy optimization through the development of large-scale models, limiting their viability in resource-constrained and low-power edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a lightweight and hardware-friendly Quantized SNN (Q-SNN) that applies quantization to both synaptic weights and membrane potentials. By significantly compressing these two key elements, the proposed Q-SNNs substantially reduce both memory usage and computational complexity. Moreover, to prevent the performance degradation caused by this compression, we present a new Weight-Spike Dual Regulation (WS-DR) method inspired by information entropy theory. Experimental evaluations on various datasets, including static and neuromorphic, demonstrate that our Q-SNNs outperform existing methods in terms of both model size and accuracy. These state-of-the-art results in efficiency and efficacy suggest that the proposed method can significantly improve edge intelligent computing.</description>

      <title>Advancing Fine-Grained Classification by Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) involves classifying closely related sub-classes. This task is difficult due to the subtle differences between classes and the high intra-class variance. Moreover, FGVC datasets are typically small and challenging to gather, thus highlighting a significant need for effective data augmentation. Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models offer new possibilities for augmenting classification datasets. While these models have been used to generate training data for classification tasks, their effectiveness in full-dataset training of FGVC models remains under-explored. Recent techniques that rely on Text2Image generation or Img2Img methods, often struggle to generate images that accurately represent the class while modifying them to a degree that significantly increases the dataset's diversity. To address these challenges, we present SaSPA: Structure and Subject Preserving Augmentation. Contrary to recent methods, our method does not use real images as guidance, thereby increasing generation flexibility and promoting greater diversity. To ensure accurate class representation, we employ conditioning mechanisms, specifically by conditioning on image edges and subject representation. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark SaSPA against both traditional and recent generative data augmentation methods. SaSPA consistently outperforms all established baselines across multiple settings, including full dataset training, contextual bias, and few-shot classification. Additionally, our results reveal interesting patterns in using synthetic data for FGVC models; for instance, we find a relationship between the amount of real data used and the optimal proportion of synthetic data.

      <title>MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation.

      <title>A Refreshed Similarity-based Upsampler for Direct High-Ratio Feature Upsampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature upsampling is a fundamental and indispensable ingredient of almost all current network structures for dense prediction tasks. Recently, a popular similarity-based feature upsampling pipeline has been proposed, which utilizes a high-resolution feature as guidance to help upsample the low-resolution deep feature based on their local similarity. Albeit achieving promising performance, this pipeline has specific limitations: 1) HR query and LR key features are not well aligned; 2) the similarity between query-key features is computed based on the fixed inner product form; 3) neighbor selection is coarsely operated on LR features, resulting in mosaic artifacts. These shortcomings make the existing methods along this pipeline primarily applicable to hierarchical network architectures with iterative features as guidance and they are not readily extended to a broader range of structures, especially for a direct high-ratio upsampling. Against the issues, we meticulously optimize every methodological design. Specifically, we firstly propose an explicitly controllable query-key feature alignment from both semantic-aware and detail-aware perspectives, and then construct a parameterized paired central difference convolution block for flexibly calculating the similarity between the well-aligned query-key features. Besides, we develop a fine-grained neighbor selection strategy on HR features, which is simple yet effective for alleviating mosaic artifacts. Based on these careful designs, we systematically construct a refreshed similarity-based feature upsampling framework named ReSFU. Extensive experiments substantiate that our proposed ReSFU is finely applicable to various types of architectures in a direct high-ratio upsampling manner, and consistently achieves satisfactory performance on different dense prediction applications, showing superior generality and ease of deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion modeling is critical in flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). Existing paradigms either consider linear combinations of bidirectional flows or directly predict bilateral flows for given timestamps without exploring favorable motion priors, thus lacking the capability of effectively modeling spatiotemporal dynamics in real-world videos. To address this limitation, in this study, we introduce Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a novel and effective approach to motion modeling for VFI. Specifically, to enable GIMM as an effective motion modeling paradigm, we design a motion encoding pipeline to model spatiotemporal motion latent from bidirectional flows extracted from pre-trained flow estimators, effectively representing input-specific motion priors. Then, we implicitly predict arbitrary-timestep optical flows within two adjacent input frames via an adaptive coordinate-based neural network, with spatiotemporal coordinates and motion latent as inputs. Our GIMM can be easily integrated with existing flow-based VFI works by supplying accurately modeled motion. We show that GIMM performs better than the current state of the art on standard VFI benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Understanding Matrix Function Normalizations in Covariance Pooling through the Lens of Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global Covariance Pooling (GCP) has been demonstrated to improve the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by exploiting second-order statistics of high-level representations. GCP typically performs classification of the covariance matrices by applying matrix function normalization, such as matrix logarithm or power, followed by a Euclidean classifier. However, covariance matrices inherently lie in a Riemannian manifold, known as the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold. The current literature does not provide a satisfactory explanation of why Euclidean classifiers can be applied directly to Riemannian features after the normalization of the matrix power. To mitigate this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and unified understanding of the matrix logarithm and power from a Riemannian geometry perspective. The underlying mechanism of matrix functions in GCP is interpreted from two perspectives: one based on tangent classifiers (Euclidean classifiers on the tangent space) and the other based on Riemannian classifiers. Via theoretical analysis and empirical validation through extensive experiments on fine-grained and large-scale visual classification datasets, we conclude that the working mechanism of the matrix functions should be attributed to the Riemannian classifiers they implicitly respect.

      <description>arXiv:2407.11802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. While contrastive learning has shown promise in self-supervised learning by creating discriminative representations, its application in knowledge distillation remains limited and focuses primarily on discrimination, neglecting the structural relationships captured by the teacher model. To address this limitation, we propose Discriminative and Consistent Distillation (DCD), which employs a contrastive loss along with a consistency regularization to minimize the discrepancy between the distributions of teacher and student representations. Our method introduces learnable temperature and bias parameters that adapt during training to balance these complementary objectives, replacing the fixed hyperparameters commonly used in contrastive learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet ILSVRC-2012, we demonstrate that DCD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with the student model sometimes surpassing the teacher's accuracy. Furthermore, we show that DCD's learned representations exhibit superior cross-dataset generalization when transferred to Tiny ImageNet and STL-10.</description>

      <title>FoodMem: Near Real-time and Precise Food Video Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Food segmentation, including in videos, is vital for addressing real-world health, agriculture, and food biotechnology issues. Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on MetaFood3D, Nutrition5k, and Vegetables &amp; Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.</description>

      <title>Visual Haystacks: A Vision-Centric Needle-In-A-Haystack Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant strides in visual question-answering for single images. Recent advancements like long-context LMMs have allowed them to ingest larger, or even multiple, images. However, the ability to process a large number of visual tokens does not guarantee effective retrieval and reasoning for multi-image question answering (MIQA), especially in real-world applications like photo album searches or satellite imagery analysis. In this work, we first assess the limitations of current benchmarks for long-context LMMs. We address these limitations by introducing a new vision-centric, long-context benchmark, "Visual Haystacks (VHs)". We comprehensively evaluate both open-source and proprietary models on VHs, and demonstrate that these models struggle when reasoning across potentially unrelated images, perform poorly on cross-image reasoning, as well as exhibit biases based on the placement of key information within the context window. Towards a solution, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), an open-source, lightweight visual-RAG framework that processes up to 10k images on a single 40G A100 GPU -- far surpassing the 1k-image limit of contemporary models. MIRAGE demonstrates up to 13% performance improvement over existing open-source LMMs on VHs, sets a new state-of-the-art on the RetVQA multi-image QA benchmark, and achieves competitive performance on single-image QA with state-of-the-art LMMs. Our dataset, model, and code are available at: https://visual-haystacks.github.io.</description>

      <title>Iterative Ensemble Training with Anti-Gradient Control for Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models, known for their tremendous ability to generate novel and high-quality samples, have recently raised concerns due to their data memorization behavior, which poses privacy risks. Recent approaches for memory mitigation either only focused on the text modality problem in cross-modal generation tasks or utilized data augmentation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. To facilitate forgetting of stored information in diffusion model parameters, we propose an iterative ensemble training strategy by splitting the data into multiple shards for training multiple models and intermittently aggregating these model parameters. Moreover, practical analysis of losses illustrates that the training loss for easily memorable images tends to be obviously lower. Thus, we propose an anti-gradient control method to exclude the sample with a lower loss value from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method, and results show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while even improving the performance slightly. Moreover, to save the computing cost, we successfully apply our method to fine-tune the well-trained diffusion models by limited epochs, demonstrating the applicability of our method. Code is available in https://github.com/liuxiao-guan/IET_AGC.</description>

      <title>DEGAS: Detailed Expressions on Full-Body Gaussian Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although neural rendering has made significant advances in creating lifelike, animatable full-body and head avatars, incorporating detailed expressions into full-body avatars remains largely unexplored. We present DEGAS, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based modeling method for full-body avatars with rich facial expressions. Trained on multiview videos of a given subject, our method learns a conditional variational autoencoder that takes both the body motion and facial expression as driving signals to generate Gaussian maps in the UV layout. To drive the facial expressions, instead of the commonly used 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) in 3D head avatars, we propose to adopt the expression latent space trained solely on 2D portrait images, bridging the gap between 2D talking faces and 3D avatars. Leveraging the rendering capability of 3DGS and the rich expressiveness of the expression latent space, the learned avatars can be reenacted to reproduce photorealistic rendering images with subtle and accurate facial expressions. Experiments on an existing dataset and our newly proposed dataset of full-body talking avatars demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We also propose an audio-driven extension of our method with the help of 2D talking faces, opening new possibilities for interactive AI agents.</description>

      <title>Perception-guided Jailbreak against Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Text-to-Image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable advancements. However, security concerns have emerged due to their potential to generate inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) images. In this paper, inspired by the observation that texts with different semantics can lead to similar human perceptions, we propose an LLM-driven perception-guided jailbreak method, termed PGJ. It is a black-box jailbreak method that requires no specific T2I model (model-free) and generates highly natural attack prompts. Specifically, we propose identifying a safe phrase that is similar in human perception yet inconsistent in text semantics with the target unsafe word and using it as a substitution. The experiments conducted on six open-source models and commercial online services with thousands of prompts have verified the effectiveness of PGJ.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Autoregressive Image Generation with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AiM, an autoregressive (AR) image generative model based on Mamba architecture. AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.

      <title>D&amp;M: Enriching E-commerce Videos with Sound Effects by Key Moment Detection and SFX Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Videos showcasing specific products are increasingly important for E-commerce. Key moments naturally exist as the first appearance of a specific product, presentation of its distinctive features, the presence of a buying link, etc. Adding proper sound effects (SFX) to these key moments, or video decoration with SFX (VDSFX), is crucial for enhancing the user engaging experience. Previous studies about adding SFX to videos perform video to SFX matching at a holistic level, lacking the ability of adding SFX to a specific moment. Meanwhile, previous studies on video highlight detection or video moment retrieval consider only moment localization, leaving moment to SFX matching untouched. By contrast, we propose in this paper D&amp;M, a unified method that accomplishes key moment detection and moment to SFX matching simultaneously. Moreover, for the new VDSFX task we build a large-scale dataset SFX-Moment from an E-commerce platform. For a fair comparison, we build competitive baselines by extending a number of current video moment detection methods to the new task. Extensive experiments on SFX-Moment show the superior performance of the proposed method over the baselines. Code and data will be released.</description>

Abstract: The rise of Extended Reality (XR) requires efficient streaming of 3D online worlds, challenging current 3DGS representations to adapt to bandwidth-constrained environments. This paper proposes LapisGS, a layered 3DGS that supports adaptive streaming and progressive rendering. Our method constructs a layered structure for cumulative representation, incorporates dynamic opacity optimization to maintain visual fidelity, and utilizes occupancy maps to efficiently manage Gaussian splats. This proposed model offers a progressive representation supporting a continuous rendering quality adapted for bandwidth-aware streaming. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in balancing visual fidelity with the compactness of the model, with up to 50.71% improvement in SSIM, 286.53% improvement in LPIPS with 23% of the original model size, and shows its potential for bandwidth-adapted 3D streaming and rendering applications.</description>

      <title>MambaPlace:Text-to-Point-Cloud Cross-Modal Place Recognition with Attention Mamba Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Place Recognition (VLVPR) enhances robot localization performance by incorporating natural language descriptions from images. By utilizing language information, VLVPR directs robot place matching, overcoming the constraint of solely depending on vision. The essence of multimodal fusion lies in mining the complementary information between different modalities. However, general fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are not well equipped to capture the dynamics of cross modal interactions, especially in the presence of complex intra modal and inter modal correlations. To this end, this paper proposes a novel coarse to fine and end to end connected cross modal place recognition framework, called MambaPlace. In the coarse localization stage, the text description and 3D point cloud are encoded by the pretrained T5 and instance encoder, respectively. They are then processed using Text Attention Mamba (TAM) and Point Clouds Mamba (PCM) for data enhancement and alignment. In the subsequent fine localization stage, the features of the text description and 3D point cloud are cross modally fused and further enhanced through cascaded Cross Attention Mamba (CCAM). Finally, we predict the positional offset from the fused text point cloud features, achieving the most accurate localization. Extensive experiments show that MambaPlace achieves improved localization accuracy on the KITTI360Pose dataset compared to the state of the art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image classification plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making, yet most models are constrained to a fixed set of predefined classes, limiting their adaptability to new conditions. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) offers a promising solution by enabling zero-shot classification through multimodal large-scale pretraining. However, while CLIP effectively captures global image content, radiology requires a more localized focus on specific pathology regions to enhance both interpretability and diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we explore the potential of incorporating visual cues into zero-shot classification, embedding visual markers $\unicode{x2013}$ such as arrows, bounding boxes, and circles $\unicode{x2013}$ directly into radiological images to guide model attention. Evaluating across four public chest X-ray datasets, we demonstrate that visual markers improve AUROC by up to 0.185, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing classification performance. Furthermore, attention map analysis confirms that visual cues help models focus on clinically relevant areas, leading to more interpretable predictions. To support further research, we use public datasets and will release our code and preprocessing pipeline, providing a reference point for future work on localized classification in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Revisiting 360 Depth Estimation with PanoGabor: A New Fusion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16227v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depth estimation from a monocular 360 image is important to the perception of the entire 3D environment. However, the inherent distortion and large field of view (FoV) in 360 images pose great challenges for this task. To this end, existing mainstream solutions typically introduce additional perspective-based 360 representations (\textit{e.g.}, Cubemap) to achieve effective feature extraction. Nevertheless, regardless of the introduced representations, they eventually need to be unified into the equirectangular projection (ERP) format for the subsequent depth estimation, which inevitably reintroduces the troublesome distortions. In this work, we propose an oriented distortion-aware Gabor Fusion framework (PGFuse) to address the above challenges. First, we introduce Gabor filters that analyze texture in the frequency domain, thereby extending the receptive fields and enhancing depth cues. To address the reintroduced distortions, we design a linear latitude-aware distortion representation method to generate customized, distortion-aware Gabor filters (PanoGabor filters). Furthermore, we design a channel-wise and spatial-wise unidirectional fusion module (CS-UFM) that integrates the proposed PanoGabor filters to unify other representations into the ERP format, delivering effective and distortion-free features. Considering the orientation sensitivity of the Gabor transform, we introduce a spherical gradient constraint to stabilize this sensitivity. Experimental results on three popular indoor 360 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed PGFuse to existing state-of-the-art solutions. Code can be available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skeletal sequences, as well-structured representations of human behaviors, play a vital role in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR. To this end, we propose the first \textbf{T}ransfer-based \textbf{A}ttack on \textbf{S}keletal \textbf{A}ction \textbf{R}ecognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothed model posterior without requiring surrogate re-training, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike previous transfer-based attacks that treat each frame independently and overlook temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack gradient, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. To exhaustively evaluate the effectiveness of existing methods and our method, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense methods. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the supplementary material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open-MAGVIT2 project produces an open-source replication of Google's MAGVIT-v2 tokenizer, a tokenizer with a super-large codebook (i.e., $2^{18}$ codes), and achieves the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet and UCF benchmarks. We also provide a tokenizer pre-trained on large-scale data, significantly outperforming Cosmos on zero-shot benchmarks (1.93 vs. 0.78 rFID on ImageNet original resolution). Furthermore, we explore its application in plain auto-regressive models to validate scalability properties, producing a family of auto-regressive image generation models ranging from 300M to 1.5B. To assist auto-regressive models in predicting with a super-large vocabulary, we factorize it into two sub-vocabulary of different sizes by asymmetric token factorization, and further introduce ``next sub-token prediction'' to enhance sub-token interaction for better generation quality. We release all models and codes to foster innovation and creativity in the field of auto-regressive visual generation.</description>

Abstract: Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods usually assume that the training image-text pairs are perfectly aligned; however, the noisy correspondence(NC) issue (i.e., incorrect or unreliable alignment) exists due to poor image quality and labeling errors. Additionally, random masking augmentation may inadvertently discard critical semantic content, introducing noisy matches between images and text descriptions. To address the above two challenges, we propose a noise label suppression method to mitigate NC and an Attention-Weighted Selective Mask (AWM) strategy to resolve the issues caused by random masking. Specifically, the Bidirectional Similarity Distribution Matching (BSDM) loss enables the model to effectively learn from positive pairs while preventing it from over-relying on them, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting to noisy labels. In conjunction with this, Weight Adjustment Focal (WAF) loss improves the model's ability to handle hard samples. Furthermore, AWM processes raw images through an EMA version of the image encoder, selectively retaining tokens with strong semantic connections to the text, enabling better feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing noise-related issues and improving retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>Direct-CP: Directed Collaborative Perception for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles via Proactive Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) leverages visual data from connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) to enhance an ego vehicle's field of view (FoV). Despite recent progress, current CP methods expand the ego vehicle's 360-degree perceptual range almost equally, which faces two key challenges. Firstly, in areas with uneven traffic distribution, focusing on directions with little traffic offers limited benefits. Secondly, under limited communication budgets, allocating excessive bandwidth to less critical directions lowers the perception accuracy in more vital areas. To address these issues, we propose Direct-CP, a proactive and direction-aware CP system aiming at improving CP in specific directions. Our key idea is to enable an ego vehicle to proactively signal its interested directions and readjust its attention to enhance local directional CP performance. To achieve this, we first propose an RSU-aided direction masking mechanism that assists an ego vehicle in identifying vital directions. Additionally, we design a direction-aware selective attention module to wisely aggregate pertinent features based on ego vehicle's directional priorities, communication budget, and the positional data of CAVs. Moreover, we introduce a direction-weighted detection loss (DWLoss) to capture the divergence between directional CP outcomes and the ground truth, facilitating effective model training. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Sim 2.0 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves 19.8\% higher local perception accuracy in interested directions and 2.5\% higher overall perception accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in collaborative 3D object detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Mining Your Own Secrets: Diffusion Classifier Scores for Continual Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image diffusion models have grown popular for their ability to efficiently acquire a new concept from user-defined text descriptions and a few images. However, in the real world, a user may wish to personalize a model on multiple concepts but one at a time, with no access to the data from previous concepts due to storage/privacy concerns. When faced with this continual learning (CL) setup, most personalization methods fail to find a balance between acquiring new concepts and retaining previous ones -- a challenge that continual personalization (CP) aims to solve. Inspired by the successful CL methods that rely on class-specific information for regularization, we resort to the inherent class-conditioned density estimates, also known as diffusion classifier (DC) scores, for continual personalization of text-to-image diffusion models. Namely, we propose using DC scores for regularizing the parameter-space and function-space of text-to-image diffusion models, to achieve continual personalization. Using several diverse evaluation setups, datasets, and metrics, we show that our proposed regularization-based CP methods outperform the state-of-the-art C-LoRA, and other baselines. Finally, by operating in the replay-free CL setup and on low-rank adapters, our method incurs zero storage and parameter overhead, respectively, over the state-of-the-art.

      <title>Perceptual Piercing: Human Visual Cue-based Object Detection in Low Visibility Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel deep learning framework inspired by atmospheric scattering and human visual cortex mechanisms to enhance object detection under poor visibility scenarios such as fog, smoke, and haze. These conditions pose significant challenges for object recognition, impacting various sectors, including autonomous driving, aviation management, and security systems. The objective is to enhance the precision and reliability of detection systems under adverse environmental conditions. The research investigates the integration of human-like visual cues, particularly focusing on selective attention and environmental adaptability, to ascertain their impact on object detection's computational efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a multi-tiered strategy that integrates an initial quick detection process, followed by targeted region-specific dehazing, and concludes with an in-depth detection phase. The approach is validated using the Foggy Cityscapes, RESIDE-beta (OTS and RTTS) datasets and is anticipated to set new performance standards in detection accuracy while significantly optimizing computational efficiency. The findings offer a viable solution for enhancing object detection in poor visibility and contribute to the broader understanding of integrating human visual principles into deep learning algorithms for intricate visual recognition challenges.</description>

      <title>ETA: Evaluating Then Aligning Safety of Vision Language Models at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones for multimodal intelligence, yet significant safety challenges limit their real-world application. While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/DripNowhy/ETA.</description>

      <title>Towards Defining an Efficient and Expandable File Format for AI-Generated Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, AI-generated content (AIGC) has gained significant traction due to its powerful creation capability. However, the storage and transmission of large amounts of high-quality AIGC images inevitably pose new challenges for recent file formats. To overcome this, we define a new file format for AIGC images, named AIGIF, enabling ultra-low bitrate coding of AIGC images. Unlike compressing AIGC images intuitively with pixel-wise space as existing file formats, AIGIF instead compresses the generation syntax. This raises a crucial question: Which generation syntax elements, e.g., text prompt, device configuration, etc, are necessary for compression/transmission? To answer this question, we systematically investigate the effects of three essential factors: platform, generative model, and data configuration. We experimentally find that a well-designed composable bitstream structure incorporating the above three factors can achieve an impressive compression ratio of even up to 1/10,000 while still ensuring high fidelity. We also introduce an expandable syntax in AIGIF to support the extension of the most advanced generation models to be developed in the future.</description>

      <title>MultiVENT 2.0: A Massive Multilingual Benchmark for Event-Centric Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently retrieving and synthesizing information from large-scale multimodal collections has become a critical challenge. However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Guidance: Improving OoDD in Vision-Language Models via Self-Guided Image-Adaptive Concept Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent emergence of foundation models trained on internet-scale data and demonstrating remarkable generalization capabilities, such foundation models have become more widely adopted, leading to an expanding range of application domains. Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Furthermore, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide), aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks. The lists of sampled images, along with the prompts and responses for each sample are available at https://github.com/daintlab/ReGuide.</description>

      <title>YOLO-RD: Introducing Relevant and Compact Explicit Knowledge to YOLO by Retriever-Dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying and localizing objects within images is a fundamental challenge, and numerous efforts have been made to enhance model accuracy by experimenting with diverse architectures and refining training strategies. Nevertheless, a prevalent limitation in existing models is overemphasizing the current input while ignoring the information from the entire dataset. We introduce an innovative Retriever-Dictionary (RD) module to address this issue. This architecture enables YOLO-based models to efficiently retrieve features from a Dictionary that contains the insight of the dataset, which is built by the knowledge from Visual Models (VM), Large Language Models (LLM), or Visual Language Models (VLM). The flexible RD enables the model to incorporate such explicit knowledge that enhances the ability to benefit multiple tasks, specifically, segmentation, detection, and classification, from pixel to image level. The experiments show that using the RD significantly improves model performance, achieving more than a 3\% increase in mean Average Precision for object detection with less than a 1% increase in model parameters. Beyond 1-stage object detection models, the RD module improves the effectiveness of 2-stage models and DETR-based architectures, such as Faster R-CNN and Deformable DETR. Code is released at https://github.com/henrytsui000/YOLO.</description>

      <title>BlinkVision: A Benchmark for Optical Flow, Scene Flow and Point Tracking Estimation using RGB Frames and Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in event-based vision suggest that these systems complement traditional cameras by providing continuous observation without frame rate limitations and a high dynamic range, making them well-suited for correspondence tasks such as optical flow and point tracking. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for correspondence tasks that include both event data and images. To address this gap, we propose BlinkVision, a large-scale and diverse benchmark with multiple modalities and dense correspondence annotations. BlinkVision offers several valuable features: 1) Rich modalities: It includes both event data and RGB images. 2) Extensive annotations: It provides dense per-pixel annotations covering optical flow, scene flow, and point tracking. 3) Large vocabulary: It contains 410 everyday categories, sharing common classes with popular 2D and 3D datasets like LVIS and ShapeNet. 4) Naturalistic: It delivers photorealistic data and covers various naturalistic factors, such as camera shake and deformation. BlinkVision enables extensive benchmarks on three types of correspondence tasks (optical flow, point tracking, and scene flow estimation) for both image-based and event-based methods, offering new observations, practices, and insights for future research. The benchmark website is https://www.blinkvision.net/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid calibration-free method FreeCap to accurately capture global multi-person motions in open environments. Our system combines a single LiDAR with expandable moving cameras, allowing for flexible and precise motion estimation in a unified world coordinate. In particular, We introduce a local-to-global pose-aware cross-sensor human-matching module that predicts the alignment among each sensor, even in the absence of calibration. Additionally, our coarse-to-fine sensor-expandable pose optimizer further optimizes the 3D human key points and the alignments, it is also capable of incorporating additional cameras to enhance accuracy. Extensive experiments on Human-M3 and FreeMotion datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-modal methods, offering an expandable and efficient solution for multi-person motion capture across various applications.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Visual Gap: Fine-Tuning Multimodal Models with Knowledge-Adapted Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research increasingly focuses on training vision-language models (VLMs) with long, detailed image captions. However, small-scale VLMs often struggle to balance the richness of these captions with the risk of hallucinating content during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore how well VLMs adapt to such captions. To quantify caption quality, we propose Decomposed NLI (DNLI), an evaluation framework that breaks down generated captions into individual propositions, assessing each in isolation. This fine-grained analysis reveals a critical balance between capturing descriptive details and preventing hallucinations. Our findings show that simply reducing caption complexity or employing standard data curation techniques does not effectively resolve this issue. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Knowledge Adapted (KnowAda) fine-tuning, a data-centric approach that automatically adapts training data with the model's existing knowledge and visual understanding. KnowAda minimizes hallucinations while preserving high descriptiveness. We validate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters) and dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances hallucination reduction and descriptiveness. Our results show that KnowAda outperforms various baselines in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We will release our code and models.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Assisted Single-Stage Framework for Joint Restoration and Fusion of Visible and Infrared Images under Hazy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared and visible (IR-VIS) image fusion has gained significant attention for its broad application value. However, existing methods often neglect the complementary role of infrared image in restoring visible image features under hazy conditions. To address this, we propose a joint learning framework that utilizes infrared image for the restoration and fusion of hazy IR-VIS images. To mitigate the adverse effects of feature diversity between IR-VIS images, we introduce a prompt generation mechanism that regulates modality-specific feature incompatibility. This creates a prompt selection matrix from non-shared image information, followed by prompt embeddings generated from a prompt pool. These embeddings help generate candidate features for dehazing. We further design an infrared-assisted feature restoration mechanism that selects candidate features based on haze density, enabling simultaneous restoration and fusion within a single-stage framework. To enhance fusion quality, we construct a multi-stage prompt embedding fusion module that leverages feature supplementation from the prompt generation module. Our method effectively fuses IR-VIS images while removing haze, yielding clear, haze-free fusion results. In contrast to two-stage methods that dehaze and then fuse, our approach enables collaborative training in a single-stage framework, making the model relatively lightweight and suitable for practical deployment. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and demonstrate advantages over existing methods.

      <title>Neural Surface Priors for Editable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computer graphics and vision, recovering easily modifiable scene appearance from image data is crucial for applications such as content creation. We introduce a novel method that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with an implicit surface representation, enabling intuitive editing of recovered scenes through mesh manipulation. Starting with a set of input images and camera poses, our approach reconstructs the scene surface using a neural signed distance field. This neural surface acts as a geometric prior guiding the training of Gaussian Splatting components, ensuring their alignment with the scene geometry. To facilitate editing, we encode the visual and geometric information into a lightweight triangle soup proxy. Edits applied to the mesh extracted from the neural surface propagate seamlessly through this intermediate structure to update the recovered appearance. Unlike previous methods relying on the triangle soup proxy representation, our approach supports a wider range of modifications and fully leverages the mesh topology, enabling a more flexible and intuitive editing process.

      <title>Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has significantly improved salient object detection (SOD) combining both RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images. However, existing deep learning-based RGB-T SOD models suffer from two major limitations. First, Transformer-based models with quadratic complexity are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bi-modal feature fusion. Second, even when these models converge to an optimal solution, there remains a frequency gap between the prediction and ground-truth. To overcome these limitations, we propose a purely Fourier transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-Embedded Network (DFENet), for accurate RGB-T SOD. To address the computational complexity when dealing with high-resolution images, we leverage the efficiency of fast Fourier transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) the Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which fuses RGB and thermal modalities with enhanced multi-dimensional representation; (2) the Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which clarifies object edges by deeply decomposing and enhancing frequency components of low-level features; and (3) the Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. To mitigate the frequency gap, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bi-modal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on four RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that DFENet outperforms fifteen existing state-of-the-art RGB-T SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components. The code is available at https://github.com/JoshuaLPF/DFENet.</description>

      <title>Object Agnostic 3D Lifting in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spatio-temporal perspective on category-agnostic 3D lifting of 2D keypoints over a temporal sequence. Our approach differs from existing state-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object-agnostic, but can only operate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but are only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is grounded in two core principles. First, general information about similar objects can be leveraged to achieve better performance when there is little object-specific training data. Second, a temporally-proximate context window is advantageous for achieving consistency throughout a sequence. These two principles allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame and per-sequence metrics for a variety of animal categories. Lastly, we release a new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences for a variety of animal categories.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Interpretability in Self-Supervised Speech Representations for Parkinson's Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works in pathological speech analysis have increasingly relied on powerful self-supervised speech representations, leading to promising results. However, the complex, black-box nature of these embeddings and the limited research on their interpretability significantly restrict their adoption for clinical diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose a novel, interpretable framework specifically designed to support Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis. Through the design of simple yet effective cross-attention mechanisms for both embedding- and temporal-level analysis, the proposed framework offers interpretability from two distinct but complementary perspectives. Experimental findings across five well-established speech benchmarks for PD detection demonstrate the framework's capability to identify meaningful speech patterns within self-supervised representations for a wide range of assessment tasks. Fine-grained temporal analyses further underscore its potential to enhance the interpretability of deep-learning pathological speech models, paving the way for the development of more transparent, trustworthy, and clinically applicable computer-assisted diagnosis systems in this domain. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, our method achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, while also demonstrating robustness in cross-lingual scenarios when applied to spontaneous speech production.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Head Position Patterns Can Align with Human Visual Concepts in Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models leverage cross-attention layers, which have been effectively utilized to enhance a range of visual generative tasks. However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic interpretability approach for diffusion models by constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with human-specified visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept has a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, with each element representing the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. To validate HRVs as interpretable features, we develop an ordered weakening analysis that demonstrates their effectiveness. Furthermore, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. Our results show that HRVs can reduce misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation, successfully modify five challenging attributes in image editing, and mitigate catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</description>

      <title>Ranking-aware adapter for text-driven image ordering with CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in downstream tasks that require quantitative concepts such as facial age estimation and image quality assessment, enabling VLMs to explore applications like image ranking and retrieval. However, existing studies typically focus on the reasoning based on a single image and heavily depend on text prompting, limiting their ability to learn comprehensive understanding from multiple images. To address this, we propose an effective yet efficient approach that reframes the CLIP model into a learning-to-rank task and introduces a lightweight adapter to augment CLIP for text-guided image ranking. Specifically, our approach incorporates learnable prompts to adapt to new instructions for ranking purposes and an auxiliary branch with ranking-aware attention, leveraging text-conditioned visual differences for additional supervision in image ranking. Our ranking-aware adapter consistently outperforms fine-tuned CLIPs on various tasks and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models designed for specific tasks like facial age estimation and image quality assessment. Overall, our approach primarily focuses on ranking images with a single instruction, which provides a natural and generalized way of learning from visual differences across images, bypassing the need for extensive text prompts tailored to individual tasks.

      <title>RADIOv2.5: Improved Baselines for Agglomerative Vision Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agglomerative models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to training vision foundation models, leveraging multi-teacher distillation from existing models such as CLIP, DINO, and SAM. This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing variants at multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), along with inference code and pretrained weights</description>

      <title>Analyzing and Mitigating Model Collapse in Rectified Flow Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training with synthetic data is becoming increasingly inevitable as synthetic content proliferates across the web, driven by the remarkable performance of recent deep generative models. This reliance on synthetic data can also be intentional, as seen in Rectified Flow models, whose Reflow method iteratively uses self-generated data to straighten the flow and improve sampling efficiency. However, recent studies have shown that repeatedly training on self-generated samples can lead to model collapse (MC), where performance degrades over time. Despite this, most recent work on MC either focuses on empirical observations or analyzes regression problems and maximum likelihood objectives, leaving a rigorous theoretical analysis of reflow methods unexplored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing both theoretical analysis and practical solutions for addressing MC in diffusion/flow models. We begin by studying Denoising Autoencoders and prove performance degradation when DAEs are iteratively trained on their own outputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to rigorously analyze model collapse in DAEs and, by extension, in diffusion models and Rectified Flow. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate that rectified flow also suffers from MC, leading to potential performance degradation in each reflow step. Additionally, we prove that incorporating real data can prevent MC during recursive DAE training, supporting the recent trend of using real data as an effective approach for mitigating MC. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Real-data Augmented Reflow and a series of improved variants, which seamlessly integrate real data into Reflow training by leveraging reverse flow. Empirical evaluations on standard image benchmarks confirm that RA Reflow effectively mitigates model collapse, preserving high-quality sample generation even with fewer sampling steps.</description>

      <title>Building a Multi-modal Spatiotemporal Expert for Zero-shot Action Recognition with CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) requires collaborative multi-modal spatiotemporal understanding. However, finetuning CLIP directly for ZSAR yields suboptimal performance, given its inherent constraints in capturing essential temporal dynamics from both vision and text perspectives, especially when encountering novel actions with fine-grained spatiotemporal discrepancies. In this work, we propose Spatiotemporal Dynamic Duo (STDD), a novel CLIP-based framework to comprehend multi-modal spatiotemporal dynamics synergistically. For the vision side, we propose an efficient Space-time Cross Attention, which captures spatiotemporal dynamics flexibly with simple yet effective operations applied before and after spatial attention, without adding additional parameters or increasing computational complexity. For the semantic side, we conduct spatiotemporal text augmentation by comprehensively constructing an Action Semantic Knowledge Graph (ASKG) to derive nuanced text prompts. The ASKG elaborates on static and dynamic concepts and their interrelations, based on the idea of decomposing actions into spatial appearances and temporal motions. During the training phase, the frame-level video representations are meticulously aligned with prompt-level nuanced text representations, which are concurrently regulated by the video representations from the frozen CLIP to enhance generalizability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, which consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches on popular video benchmarks (i.e., Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51) under challenging ZSAR settings.</description>

      <title>Guided and Variance-Corrected Fusion with One-shot Style Alignment for Large-Content Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Producing large images using small diffusion models is gaining increasing popularity, as the cost of training large models could be prohibitive. A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a plug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation. Code: https://github.com/TitorX/GVCFDiffusion</description>

      <title>HoVLE: Unleashing the Power of Monolithic Vision-Language Models with Holistic Vision-Language Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

      <title>Defeasible Visual Entailment: Benchmark, Evaluator, and Reward-Driven Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new task called Defeasible Visual Entailment (DVE), where the goal is to allow the modification of the entailment relationship between an image premise and a text hypothesis based on an additional update. While this concept is well-established in Natural Language Inference, it remains unexplored in visual entailment. At a high level, DVE enables models to refine their initial interpretations, leading to improved accuracy and reliability in various applications such as detecting misleading information in images, enhancing visual question answering, and refining decision-making processes in autonomous systems. Existing metrics do not adequately capture the change in the entailment relationship brought by updates. To address this, we propose a novel inference-aware evaluator designed to capture changes in entailment strength induced by updates, using pairwise contrastive learning and categorical information learning. Additionally, we introduce a reward-driven update optimization method to further enhance the quality of updates generated by multimodal models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluator and optimization method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation applications, negative embeddings have proven to be a simple yet effective approach for enhancing generation quality. Typically, these negative embeddings are derived from user-defined negative prompts, which, while being functional, are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we introduce ReNeg, an end-to-end method designed to learn improved Negative embeddings guided by a Reward model. We employ a reward feedback learning framework and integrate classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training process, which was previously utilized only during inference, thus enabling the effective learning of negative embeddings. We also propose two strategies for learning both global and per-sample negative embeddings. Extensive experiments show that the learned negative embedding significantly outperforms null-text and handcrafted counterparts, achieving substantial improvements in human preference alignment. Additionally, the negative embedding learned within the same text embedding space exhibits strong generalization capabilities. For example, using the same CLIP text encoder, the negative embedding learned on SD1.5 can be seamlessly transferred to text-to-image or even text-to-video models such as ControlNet, ZeroScope, and VideoCrafter2, resulting in consistent performance improvements across the board.</description>

      <title>Towards Identity-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval: a Dataset and a Baseline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction is essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) Message Interface (FMI). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. CAI's significant scalability improvement on large data sizes provides an accessible and effective tool for the astronomy community.

      <title>Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn "world models" that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

      <title>CookingDiffusion: Cooking Procedural Image Generation with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation models have excelled in creating diverse and realistic images. This success extends to food imagery, where various conditional inputs like cooking styles, ingredients, and recipes are utilized. However, a yet-unexplored challenge is generating a sequence of procedural images based on cooking steps from a recipe. This could enhance the cooking experience with visual guidance and possibly lead to an intelligent cooking simulation system. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel task called \textbf{cooking procedural image generation}. This task is inherently demanding, as it strives to create photo-realistic images that align with cooking steps while preserving sequential consistency. To collectively tackle these challenges, we present \textbf{CookingDiffusion}, a novel approach that leverages Stable Diffusion and three innovative Memory Nets to model procedural prompts. These prompts encompass text prompts (representing cooking steps), image prompts (corresponding to cooking images), and multi-modal prompts (mixing cooking steps and images), ensuring the consistent generation of cooking procedural images. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we preprocess the YouCookII dataset, establishing a new benchmark. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model excels at generating high-quality cooking procedural images with remarkable consistency across sequential cooking steps, as measured by both the FID and the proposed Average Procedure Consistency metrics. Furthermore, CookingDiffusion demonstrates the ability to manipulate ingredients and cooking methods in a recipe. We will make our code, models, and dataset publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Grounding Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Controlled High-Quality Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative diffusion models have demonstrated outstanding performance in synthesizing diverse, high-quality visuals from text captions. Several layout-to-image models have been developed to control the generation process by utilizing a wide range of layouts, such as segmentation maps, edges, and human keypoints. In this work, we propose ObjectDiffusion, a model that conditions T2I diffusion models on semantic and spatial grounding information, enabling the precise rendering and placement of desired objects in specific locations defined by bounding boxes. To achieve this, we make substantial modifications to the network architecture introduced in ControlNet to integrate it with the grounding method proposed in GLIGEN. We fine-tune ObjectDiffusion on the COCO2017 training dataset and evaluate it on the COCO2017 validation dataset. Our model improves the precision and quality of controllable image generation, achieving an AP$_{\text{50}}$ of 46.6, an AR of 44.5, and an FID of 19.8, outperforming the current SOTA model trained on open-source datasets across all three metrics. ObjectDiffusion demonstrates a distinctive capability in synthesizing diverse, high-quality, high-fidelity images that seamlessly conform to the semantic and spatial control layout. Evaluated in qualitative and quantitative tests, ObjectDiffusion exhibits remarkable grounding capabilities in closed-set and open-set vocabulary settings across a wide variety of contexts. The qualitative assessment verifies the ability of ObjectDiffusion to generate multiple detailed objects in varying sizes, forms, and locations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scene Understanding from Vision-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Images depicting complex, dynamic scenes are challenging to parse automatically, requiring both high-level comprehension of the overall situation and fine-grained identification of participating entities and their interactions. Current approaches use distinct methods tailored to sub-tasks such as Situation Recognition and detection of Human-Human and Human-Object Interactions. However, recent advances in image understanding have often leveraged web-scale vision-language (V&amp;L) representations to obviate task-specific engineering. In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic scene understanding tasks by leveraging knowledge from modern, frozen V&amp;L representations. By framing these tasks in a generic manner - as predicting and parsing structured text, or by directly concatenating representations to the input of existing models - we achieve state-of-the-art results while using a minimal number of trainable parameters relative to existing approaches. Moreover, our analysis of dynamic knowledge of these representations shows that recent, more powerful representations effectively encode dynamic scene semantics, making this approach newly possible.</description>

      <title>Quantized Spike-driven Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks are emerging as a promising energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks due to their spike-driven paradigm. However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on enhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which typically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which achieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter. Regrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that the bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA) leads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing significant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take inspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization strategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at the lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a fine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the distribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the bi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy efficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage.For instance, when compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer achieves 80.3% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of 6.0$\times$ and 8.1$\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2501.16037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for hazard analysis in dashcam footage, addressing the detection of driver reactions to hazards, the identification of hazardous objects, and the generation of descriptive captions. We first introduce a method for detecting driver reactions through speed and sound anomaly detection, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques. For hazard detection, we employ a set of heuristic rules as weak classifiers, which are combined using an ensemble method. This ensemble approach is further refined with differential privacy to mitigate overconfidence, ensuring robustness despite the lack of labeled data. Lastly, we use state-of-the-art vision-language models for hazard captioning, generating descriptive labels for the detected hazards. Our method achieved the highest scores in the Challenge on Out-of-Label in Autonomous Driving, demonstrating its effectiveness across all three tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2501.16769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning can resolve numerous image or linguistic processing problems when effectively trained. This study investigated simple yet efficient methods for adapting previously learned foundation models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks. Our research proposed "Beyond-Labels," a lightweight transformer-based fusion module that uses a handful of image segmentation data to fuse frozen image representations with language concepts. This strategy allows the model to successfully actualize enormous knowledge from pretrained models without requiring extensive retraining, making the model data-efficient and scalable. Furthermore, we efficiently captured positional information in images using Fourier embeddings, thus improving the generalization across various image sizes, addressing one of the key limitations of previous methods. Extensive ablation tests were performed to investigate the important components of our proposed method; when tested against the common benchmark PASCAL-5i, it demonstrated superior performance despite being trained on frozen image and language characteristics.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the first-rank solution for the Multi-Modal Action Recognition Challenge, part of the Multi-Modal Visual Pattern Recognition Workshop at the \acl{ICPR} 2024. The competition aimed to recognize human actions using a diverse dataset of 20 action classes, collected from multi-modal sources. The proposed approach is built upon the \acl{TSM}, a technique aimed at efficiently capturing temporal dynamics in video data, incorporating multiple data input types. Our strategy included transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, followed by meticulous fine-tuning on the challenge's specific dataset to optimize performance for the 20 action classes. We carefully selected a backbone network to balance computational efficiency and recognition accuracy and further refined the model using an ensemble technique that integrates outputs from different modalities. This ensemble approach proved crucial in boosting the overall performance. Our solution achieved a perfect top-1 accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recognizing human actions across 20 classes. Our code is available online https://github.com/ffyyytt/TSM-MMVPR.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Class-Agnostic Counting: Advancements from Reference-Based to Open-World Text-Guided Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual object counting has recently shifted towards class-agnostic counting (CAC), which addresses the challenge of counting objects across arbitrary categories -- a crucial capability for flexible and generalizable counting systems. Unlike humans, who effortlessly identify and count objects from diverse categories without prior knowledge, most existing counting methods are restricted to enumerating instances of known classes, requiring extensive labeled datasets for training and struggling in open-vocabulary settings. In contrast, CAC aims to count objects belonging to classes never seen during training, operating in a few-shot setting. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive review of CAC methodologies. We propose a taxonomy to categorize CAC approaches into three paradigms based on how target object classes can be specified: reference-based, reference-less, and open-world text-guided. Reference-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance by relying on exemplar-guided mechanisms. Reference-less methods eliminate exemplar dependency by leveraging inherent image patterns. Finally, open-world text-guided methods use vision-language models, enabling object class descriptions via textual prompts, offering a flexible and promising solution. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an overview of the architectures of 29 CAC approaches and report their results on gold-standard benchmarks. We compare their performance and discuss their strengths and limitations. Specifically, we present results on the FSC-147 dataset, setting a leaderboard using gold-standard metrics, and on the CARPK dataset to assess generalization capabilities. Finally, we offer a critical discussion of persistent challenges, such as annotation dependency and generalization, alongside future directions. We believe this survey will be a valuable resource, showcasing CAC advancements and guiding future research.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of generative AI technologies has heightened the importance of effectively distinguishing between human and AI-generated content, as well as classifying outputs from diverse generative models. This paper presents a scalable framework that integrates perceptual hashing, similarity measurement, and pseudo-labeling to address these challenges. Our method enables the incorporation of new generative models without retraining, ensuring adaptability and robustness in dynamic scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations on the Defactify4 dataset demonstrate competitive performance in text and image classification tasks, achieving high accuracy across both distinguishing human and AI-generated content and classifying among generative methods.

      <title>TEST-V: TEst-time Support-set Tuning for Zero-shot Video Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, adapting Vision Language Models (VLMs) to zero-shot visual classification by tuning class embedding with a few prompts (Test-time Prompt Tuning, TPT) or replacing class names with generated visual samples (support-set) has shown promising results. However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathoGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps). PathoGen code is available for open use by the research community through GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathoGen.</description>

      <title>Progressive Correspondence Regenerator for Robust 3D Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining enough high-quality correspondences is crucial for robust registration. Existing correspondence refinement methods mostly follow the paradigm of outlier removal, which either fails to correctly identify the accurate correspondences under extreme outlier ratios, or select too few correct correspondences to support robust registration. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named Regor, which is a progressive correspondence regenerator that generates higher-quality matches whist sufficiently robust for numerous outliers. In each iteration, we first apply prior-guided local grouping and generalized mutual matching to generate the local region correspondences. A powerful center-aware three-point consistency is then presented to achieve local correspondence correction, instead of removal. Further, we employ global correspondence refinement to obtain accurate correspondences from a global perspective. Through progressive iterations, this process yields a large number of high-quality correspondences. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed Regor significantly outperforms existing outlier removal techniques. More critically, our approach obtain 10 times more correct correspondences than outlier removal methods. As a result, our method is able to achieve robust registration even with weak features. The code will be released.</description>

Abstract: Face editing methods, essential for tasks like virtual avatars, digital human synthesis and identity preservation, have traditionally been built upon GAN-based techniques, while recent focus has shifted to diffusion-based models due to their success in image reconstruction. However, diffusion models still face challenges in controlling specific attributes and preserving the consistency of other unchanged attributes especially the identity characteristics. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion (SD) models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involves the combinations of target background, identity and face attributes aimed to edit. We strive to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable consistency of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Attribute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) A high-consistency FaceFusion method that transfers identity features from the Identity Encoder to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained SD model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.

      <title>Disentangling CLIP Features for Enhanced Localized Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in coarse-grained tasks like image classification and retrieval. However, they struggle with fine-grained tasks that require localized understanding. To investigate this weakness, we comprehensively analyze CLIP features and identify an important issue: semantic features are highly correlated. Specifically, the features of a class encode information about other classes, which we call mutual feature information (MFI). This mutual information becomes evident when we query a specific class and unrelated objects are activated along with the target class. To address this issue, we propose Unmix-CLIP, a novel framework designed to reduce MFI and improve feature disentanglement. We introduce MFI loss, which explicitly separates text features by projecting them into a space where inter-class similarity is minimized. To ensure a corresponding separation in image features, we use multi-label recognition (MLR) to align the image features with the separated text features. This ensures that both image and text features are disentangled and aligned across modalities, improving feature separation for downstream tasks. For the COCO- 14 dataset, Unmix-CLIP reduces feature similarity by 24.9%. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations of MLR and zeroshot semantic segmentation (ZS3). In MLR, our method performs competitively on the VOC2007 and surpasses SOTA approaches on the COCO-14 dataset, using fewer training parameters. Additionally, Unmix-CLIP consistently outperforms existing ZS3 methods on COCO and VOC</description>

      <title>GHOST: Gaussian Hypothesis Open-Set Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluations of large-scale recognition methods typically focus on overall performance. While this approach is common, it often fails to provide insights into performance across individual classes, which can lead to fairness issues and misrepresentation. Addressing these gaps is crucial for accurately assessing how well methods handle novel or unseen classes and ensuring a fair evaluation. To address fairness in Open-Set Recognition (OSR), we demonstrate that per-class performance can vary dramatically. We introduce Gaussian Hypothesis Open Set Technique (GHOST), a novel hyperparameter-free algorithm that models deep features using class-wise multivariate Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrices. We apply Z-score normalization to logits to mitigate the impact of feature magnitudes that deviate from the model's expectations, thereby reducing the likelihood of the network assigning a high score to an unknown sample. We evaluate GHOST across multiple ImageNet-1K pre-trained deep networks and test it with four different unknown datasets. Using standard metrics such as AUOSCR, AUROC and FPR95, we achieve statistically significant improvements, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-scale OSR.

      <title>Kronecker Mask and Interpretive Prompts are Language-Action Video Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has significantly advanced image-based vision learning. A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach.</description>

      <title>CLIP Behaves like a Bag-of-Words Model Cross-modally but not Uni-modally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) has become a popular choice for various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have questioned its ability to represent compositional concepts effectively. These works suggest that CLIP often acts like a bag-of-words (BoW) model, interpreting images and text as sets of individual concepts without grasping the structural relationships. In particular, CLIP struggles to correctly bind attributes to their corresponding objects when multiple objects are present in an image or text. In this work, we investigate why CLIP exhibits this BoW-like behavior. We find that the correct attribute-object binding information is already present in individual text and image modalities. Instead, the issue lies in the cross-modal alignment, which relies on cosine similarity. To address this, we propose Linear Attribute Binding CLIP or LABCLIP. It applies a linear transformation to text embeddings before computing cosine similarity. This approach significantly improves CLIP's ability to bind attributes to correct objects, thereby enhancing its compositional understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/kdariina/CLIP-not-BoW-unimodally.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present synthetic data generation framework for flood hazard detection system. For high fidelity and quality, we characterize several real-world properties into virtual world and simulate the flood situation by controlling them. For the sake of efficiency, recent generative models in image-to-3D and urban city synthesis are leveraged to easily composite flood environments so that we avoid data bias due to the hand-crafted manner. Based on our framework, we build the flood synthetic dataset with 5 levels, dubbed MultiFloodSynth which contains rich annotation types like normal map, segmentation, 3D bounding box for a variety of downstream task. In experiments, our dataset demonstrate the enhanced performance of flood hazard detection with on-par realism compared with real dataset.</description>

      <title>ELITE: Enhanced Language-Image Toxicity Evaluation for Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain vulnerable to malicious prompts that induce harmful outputs. Existing safety benchmarks for VLMs primarily rely on automated evaluation methods, but these methods struggle to detect implicit harmful content or produce inaccurate evaluations. Therefore, we found that existing benchmarks have low levels of harmfulness, ambiguous data, and limited diversity in image-text pair combinations. To address these issues, we propose the ELITE benchmark, a high-quality safety evaluation benchmark for VLMs, underpinned by our enhanced evaluation method, the ELITE evaluator. The ELITE evaluator explicitly incorporates a toxicity score to accurately assess harmfulness in multimodal contexts, where VLMs often provide specific, convincing, but unharmful descriptions of images. We filter out ambiguous and low-quality image-text pairs from existing benchmarks using the ELITE evaluator and generate diverse combinations of safe and unsafe image-text pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that the ELITE evaluator achieves superior alignment with human evaluations compared to prior automated methods, and the ELITE benchmark offers enhanced benchmark quality and diversity. By introducing ELITE, we pave the way for safer, more robust VLMs, contributing essential tools for evaluating and mitigating safety risks in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>HumanDiT: Pose-Guided Diffusion Transformer for Long-form Human Motion Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beautiful Images, Toxic Words: Understanding and Addressing Offensive Text in Generated Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art visual generation models, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Vision Auto-Regressive Models (VARs), produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) and VARs (e.g., Infinity) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we explore safety fine-tuning of the text encoder underlying major DM architectures using a customized dataset. Thereby, we suppress NSFW generation while preserving overall image and text generation quality. Finally, to advance research in this area, we introduce ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. ToxicBench provides a curated dataset of harmful prompts, new metrics, and an evaluation pipeline assessing both NSFW-ness and generation quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ScreenQA, a novel benchmarking dataset designed to advance screen content understanding through question answering. The existing screen datasets are focused either on low-level structural and component understanding, or on a much higher-level composite task such as navigation and task completion for autonomous agents. ScreenQA attempts to bridge this gap. By annotating 86k question-answer pairs over the RICO dataset, we aim to benchmark the screen reading comprehension capacity, thereby laying the foundation for vision-based automation over screenshots. Our annotations encompass full answers, short answer phrases, and corresponding UI contents with bounding boxes, enabling four subtasks to address various application scenarios. We evaluate the dataset's efficacy using both open-weight and proprietary models in zero-shot, fine-tuned, and transfer learning settings. We further demonstrate positive transfer to web applications, highlighting its potential beyond mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Label-free segmentation from cardiac ultrasound using self-supervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation and measurement of cardiac chambers is critical in cardiac ultrasound but is laborious and poorly reproducible. Neural networks can assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manual annotations. We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels) segmentation combining computer vision, clinical domain knowledge, and deep learning. We trained on 450 echocardiograms (93,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate biometrics. We also tested against external images from an additional 10,030 patients with available manual tracings of the left ventricle. r2 between clinically measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported inter-clinician variation and comparable to supervised learning across several different measurements (r2 0.56-0.84). Average accuracy for detecting abnormal chamber size and function was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.97) compared to clinical measurements. A subset of test echocardiograms (n=553) had corresponding cardiac MRIs, where MRI is the gold standard. Correlation between pipeline and MRI measurements was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and MRI. Finally, the pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an average Dice score of 0.89 (95% CI [0.89]) in the external, manually labeled dataset. Our results demonstrate a manual-label free, clinically valid, and highly scalable method for segmentation from ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality.</description>

Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires requires advanced methods for effective surveillance and management. Traditional ground-based observation techniques often struggle to adapt to rapidly changing fire behavior and environmental conditions. This paper examines the application of multispectral aerial and satellite imagery in wildfire management, emphasizing the identification and analysis of key factors influencing wildfire behavior, such as combustible vegetation and water features. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and the presentation of two practical case studies, we assess various multispectral indices and evaluate their effectiveness in extracting critical environmental attributes essential for wildfire prevention and management. Our case studies highlight several indices as particularly effective for segmentation and extraction: NVDI for vegetation, MNDWI for water features, and MSR for artificial structures. These indices significantly enhance wildfire data processing, thereby supporting improved monitoring and response strategies.</description>

Abstract: Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation. This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development in which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) directly convert visual designs into code implementations. In this work, we construct Design2Code - the first real-world benchmark for this task. Specifically, we manually curate 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations to validate the performance ranking. To rigorously benchmark MLLMs, we test various multimodal prompting methods on frontier models such as GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Gemini, and Claude. Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and generating correct layout designs.</description>

      <title>CAMSIC: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08505v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

      <title>DRoP: Distributionally Robust Data Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to argue that choosing appropriate class pruning ratios, coupled with random pruning within classes has potential to improve worst-class performance. We thus propose DRoP, a distributionally robust approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving distributional robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Supervised PET Anomaly Detection using Implicitly-Guided Attention-Conditional Counterfactual Diffusion Modeling: a Multi-Center, Multi-Cancer, and Multi-Tracer Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert annotations. Current un-/weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks trained only on healthy data; however GAN-based networks are more challenging to train due to issues with simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, etc. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised Implicitly guided COuNterfactual diffusion model for Detecting Anomalies in PET images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases containing both local and public datasets. The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUVmax thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.</description>

      <title>Talk2Radar: Bridging Natural Language with 4D mmWave Radar for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied perception is essential for intelligent vehicles and robots in interactive environmental understanding. However, these advancements primarily focus on vision, with limited attention given to using 3D modeling sensors, restricting a comprehensive understanding of objects in response to prompts containing qualitative and quantitative queries. Recently, as a promising automotive sensor with affordable cost, 4D millimeter-wave radars provide denser point clouds than conventional radars and perceive both semantic and physical characteristics of objects, thereby enhancing the reliability of perception systems. To foster the development of natural language-driven context understanding in radar scenes for 3D visual grounding, we construct the first dataset, Talk2Radar, which bridges these two modalities for 3D Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). Talk2Radar contains 8,682 referring prompt samples with 20,558 referred objects. Moreover, we propose a novel model, T-RadarNet, for 3D REC on point clouds, achieving State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance on the Talk2Radar dataset compared to counterparts. Deformable-FPN and Gated Graph Fusion are meticulously designed for efficient point cloud feature modeling and cross-modal fusion between radar and text features, respectively. Comprehensive experiments provide deep insights into radar-based 3D REC. We release our project at https://github.com/GuanRunwei/Talk2Radar.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General Accelerated Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of generalizable models that achieve state-of-the-art performance across various imaging tasks. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures, in particular, have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities when pre-trained on large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, enabling a unified reconstruction framework. By leveraging a shared transformer backbone, MR-IPT effectively learns universal feature representations, allowing it to generalize across diverse reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR-IPT outperforms both CNN-based and existing transformer-based methods, achieving superior reconstruction quality across varying acceleration factors and sampling masks. Moreover, MR-IPT exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance even under unseen acquisition setups, highlighting its potential as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerated MRI. Our findings suggest that transformer-based general models can significantly advance MRI reconstruction, offering improved adaptability and stability compared to traditional deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Rationality in Language and Multimodal Agents: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work discusses how to build more rational language and multimodal agents and what criteria define rationality in intelligent systems.Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by decision-making that aligns with evidence and logical principles. It plays a crucial role in reliable problem-solving by ensuring well-grounded and consistent solutions. Despite their progress, large language models (LLMs) often fall short of rationality due to their bounded knowledge space and inconsistent outputs. In response, recent efforts have shifted toward developing multimodal and multi-agent systems, as well as integrating modules like external tools, programming codes, symbolic reasoners, utility function, and conformal risk controls rather than relying solely on a single LLM for decision-making. This paper surveys state-of-the-art advancements in language and multimodal agents, assesses their role in enhancing rationality, and outlines open challenges and future research directions. We maintain an open repository at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/Agent_Rationality.</description>

      <title>VLind-Bench: Measuring Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various multimodal tasks. However, they suffer from a problem known as language prior, where responses are generated based solely on textual patterns while disregarding image information. Addressing the issue of language prior is crucial, as it can lead to undesirable biases or hallucinations when dealing with images that are out of training distribution. Despite its importance, current methods for accurately measuring language priors in LVLMs are poorly studied. Although existing benchmarks based on counterfactual or out-of-distribution images can partially be used to measure language priors, they fail to disentangle language priors from other confounding factors. To this end, we propose a new benchmark called VLind-Bench, which is the first benchmark specifically designed to measure the language priors, or blindness, of LVLMs. It not only includes tests on counterfactual images to assess language priors but also involves a series of tests to evaluate more basic capabilities such as commonsense knowledge, visual perception, and commonsense biases. For each instance in our benchmark, we ensure that all these basic tests are passed before evaluating the language priors, thereby minimizing the influence of other factors on the assessment. The evaluation and analysis of recent LVLMs in our benchmark reveal that almost all models exhibit a significant reliance on language priors, presenting a strong challenge in the field.</description>

      <title>ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have been long known for being problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. A TSF foundation model serving TSF tasks across different applications can reverse such an impression. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers a pioneering study in developing a TSF foundation model and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. In ViTime, a method synthesizing authentic time series periodic and trend patterns is developed to enrich sample pattern diversity. A deep architecture operating TSF in image metric space is designed to achieve significantly enhanced TSF generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's SOTA performance across multiple settings. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15%. With just 10% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks trained on complete datasets, with this performance gap widening further at 100\% fine-tuning. Additionally, ViTime exhibits exceptional robustness, handling missing data without imputation and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30% under various data perturbations.</description>

      <title>ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>CISCA and CytoDArk0: a Cell Instance Segmentation and Classification method for histo(patho)logical image Analyses and a new, open, Nissl-stained dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Delineating and classifying individual cells in microscopy tissue images is inherently challenging yet remains essential for advancements in medical and neuroscientific research. In this work, we propose a new deep learning framework, CISCA, for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices. At the core of CISCA is a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately produces the segmentation of individual cells. The third head enables the simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H&amp;Estained datasets that cover diverse tissue types and magnifications. In addition, we introduce CytoDArk0, the first annotated dataset of Nissl-stained histological images of the mammalian brain, containing nearly 40k annotated neurons and glia cells, aimed at facilitating advancements in digital neuropathology and brain cytoarchitecture studies. We evaluate CISCA against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility, robustness, and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques. This makes CISCA well-suited for detailed analyses of cell morphology and efficient cell counting in both digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use in covert (single-fixation) search with briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea (foveal neglect), and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise can cause search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have broad implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.</description>

      <title>FedEx-LoRA: Exact Aggregation for Federated and Efficient Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09432v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a popular technique for efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/RaghavSinghal10/fedex-lora.</description>

      <title>CleanUMamba: A Compact Mamba Network for Speech Denoising using Channel Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CleanUMamba, a time-domain neural network architecture designed for real-time causal audio denoising directly applied to raw waveforms. CleanUMamba leverages a U-Net encoder-decoder structure, incorporating the Mamba state-space model in the bottleneck layer. By replacing conventional self-attention and LSTM mechanisms with Mamba, our architecture offers superior denoising performance while maintaining a constant memory footprint, enabling streaming operation. To enhance efficiency, we applied structured channel pruning, achieving an 8X reduction in model size without compromising audio quality. Our model demonstrates strong results in the Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression challenge. Specifically, CleanUMamba achieves a PESQ score of 2.42 and STOI of 95.1% with only 442K parameters and 468M MACs, matching or outperforming larger models in real-time performance.

      <description>arXiv:2410.11766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Digital Pre-distortion (DPD) in modern communication systems necessitates efficient hardware implementations. This paper presents DPD-NeuralEngine, an ultra-fast, tiny-area, and power-efficient DPD accelerator based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network (NN). Leveraging a co-designed software and hardware approach, our 22 nm CMOS implementation operates at 2 GHz, capable of processing I/Q signals up to 250 MSps. Experimental results demonstrate a throughput of 256.5 GOPS and power efficiency of 1.32 TOPS/W with DPD linearization performance measured in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -45.3 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -39.8 dB. To our knowledge, this work represents the first AI-based DPD application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerator, achieving a power-area efficiency (PAE) of 6.6 TOPS/W/mm$^2$.</description>

      <title>WorldCuisines: A Massive-Scale Benchmark for Multilingual and Multicultural Visual Question Answering on Global Cuisines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with culture-specific knowledge, particularly in languages other than English and in underrepresented cultural contexts. To evaluate their understanding of such knowledge, we introduce WorldCuisines, a massive-scale benchmark for multilingual and multicultural, visually grounded language understanding. This benchmark includes a visual question answering (VQA) dataset with text-image pairs across 30 languages and dialects, spanning 9 language families and featuring over 1 million data points, making it the largest multicultural VQA benchmark to date. It includes tasks for identifying dish names and their origins. We provide evaluation datasets in two sizes (12k and 60k instances) alongside a training dataset (1 million instances). Our findings show that while VLMs perform better with correct location context, they struggle with adversarial contexts and predicting specific regional cuisines and languages. To support future research, we release a knowledge base with annotated food entries and images along with the VQA data.</description>

      <title>PiLocNet: Physics-informed neural network on 3D localization with rotating point spread function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the 3D localization problem using point spread function (PSF) engineering, we propose a novel enhancement of our previously introduced localization neural network, LocNet. The improved network is a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that we call PiLocNet. Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority. Although the paper focuses on the use of single-lobe rotating PSF to encode the full 3D source location, we expect the method to be widely applicable to other PSFs and imaging problems that are constrained by known forward processes.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via Summary-Guided Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating detailed and coherent responses from visual inputs. However, they are prone to generate hallucinations due to an over-reliance on language priors. To address this issue, we investigate the language priors in LVLMs and make two key observations: (1) Even when predicting the tokens associated with image-related part-of-speech (POS), models increasingly rely on linguistic priors as the token sequences grow, thereby amplifying hallucinations. (2) Methods that directly calibrate LVLM's output distribution to mitigate language priors can lead to a degradation in text quality or even exacerbate hallucinations. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method, Summary-Guided Decoding (SumGD). This method naturally encourages the model to focus more on image information by reducing the text context through summaries, while controlling only the image-related POS tokens to maintain text quality. Through experiments, we demonstrate that SumGD achieves state-of-the-art performance on object hallucination benchmarks. Furthermore, in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall, SumGD achieves Pareto optimality among the existing methods. Lastly, we observe that although existing methods struggle to balance the reduction of object hallucinations with maintaining text quality, SumGD demonstrates robustness in handling this challenge.</description>

      <title>MultiChartQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Multi-Chart Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities across various tasks, including visual question answering and chart comprehension, yet existing benchmarks for chart-related tasks fall short in capturing the complexity of real-world multi-chart scenarios. Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-chart tasks, neglecting the multi-hop reasoning required to extract and integrate information from multiple charts, which is essential in practical applications. To fill this gap, we introduce MultiChartQA, a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in four key areas: direct question answering, parallel question answering, comparative reasoning, and sequential reasoning. Our evaluation of a wide range of MLLMs reveals significant performance gaps compared to humans. These results highlight the challenges in multi-chart comprehension and the potential of MultiChartQA to drive advancements in this field.

      <title>Diffusion Transformer Policy: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Visual-Language-Action Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large visual-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict individual discretized or continuous action by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action sequence with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head for action embedding. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Diffusion Transformer Policy on Maniskill2, Libero, Calvin and SimplerEnv, as well as the real-world Franka arm, achieving consistent better performance on Real-to-Sim benchmark SimplerEnv, real-world Franka Arm and Libero compared to OpenVLA and Octo. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin task ABC-&gt;D, improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2.

      <title>Commissioning An All-Sky Infrared Camera Array for Detection Of Airborne Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.</description>

      <title>SageAttention2: Efficient Attention with Thorough Outlier Smoothing and Per-thread INT4 Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>NBM: an Open Dataset for the Acoustic Monitoring of Nocturnal Migratory Birds in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlights the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we demonstrate that a two-stage object detection model, tailored for the processing of audio data, can be trained on our dataset to retrieve localized bounding box coordinates around each signal of interest in a spectrogram. This object detection approach, which is largely overlooked in the bird sound recognition literature, allows important applications by potentially differentiating individual birds within audio windows. Further, we show that the accuracy of our recognition model on the 45 main species of the dataset competes with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger datasets. This highlights the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.</description>

      <title>EnerVerse: Envisioning Embodied Future Space for Robotics Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EnerVerse, a generative robotics foundation model that constructs and interprets embodied spaces. EnerVerse employs an autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we propose Free Anchor Views (FAVs), a multi-view video representation offering flexible, task-adaptive perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and environmental constraints. Additionally, we present EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining the generative model with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forming a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging these innovations, EnerVerse translates 4D world representations into physical actions via a policy head (EnerVerse-A), enabling robots to execute task instructions. EnerVerse-A achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Test-time Alignment of Diffusion Models without Reward Over-optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel in generative tasks, but aligning them with specific objectives while maintaining their versatility remains challenging. Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

      <title>VL-Nav: Real-time Vision-Language Navigation with Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation in unknown environments is crucial for mobile robots. In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, our method integrates pixel-wise vision-language features with curiosity-driven exploration. This approach enables robust navigation to human-instructed instances across diverse environments. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and evaluate its performance through comprehensive navigation tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments, spanning different scales and semantic complexities. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</description>

      <title>Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>Detecting Backdoor Samples in Contrastive Language Image Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has been found to be vulnerable to poisoning backdoor attacks where the adversary can achieve an almost perfect attack success rate on CLIP models by poisoning only 0.01\% of the training dataset. This raises security concerns on the current practice of pretraining large-scale models on unscrutinized web data using CLIP. In this work, we analyze the representations of backdoor-poisoned samples learned by CLIP models and find that they exhibit unique characteristics in their local subspace, i.e., their local neighborhoods are far more sparse than that of clean samples. Based on this finding, we conduct a systematic study on detecting CLIP backdoor attacks and show that these attacks can be easily and efficiently detected by traditional density ratio-based local outlier detectors, whereas existing backdoor sample detection methods fail. Our experiments also reveal that an unintentional backdoor already exists in the original CC3M dataset and has been trained into a popular open-source model released by OpenCLIP. Based on our detector, one can clean up a million-scale web dataset (e.g., CC3M) efficiently within 15 minutes using 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/Detect-CLIP-Backdoor-Samples}{GitHub repository}.</description>

Abstract: Effective self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been key to unlocking large datasets for representation learning. While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (&lt;1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

      <title>UniForm: A Unified Diffusion Transformer for Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03897</link>

Abstract: As a natural multimodal content, audible video delivers an immersive sensory experience. Consequently, audio-video generation systems have substantial potential. However, existing diffusion-based studies mainly employ relatively independent modules for generating each modality, which lack exploration of shared-weight generative modules. This approach may under-use the intrinsic correlations between audio and visual modalities, potentially resulting in sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose UniForm, a unified diffusion transformer designed to enhance cross-modal consistency. By concatenating auditory and visual information, UniForm learns to generate audio and video simultaneously within a unified latent space, facilitating the creation of high-quality and well-aligned audio-visual pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method in joint audio-video generation, audio-guided video generation, and video-guided audio generation tasks. Our demos are available at https://uniform-t2av.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks Bridging Art and Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have greatly influenced the development of computer vision and artificial intelligence in the past decade and also connected art and machine intelligence together. This book begins with a detailed introduction to the fundamental principles and historical development of GANs, contrasting them with traditional generative models and elucidating the core adversarial mechanisms through illustrative Python examples. The text systematically addresses the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings including probability theory, statistics, and game theory providing a solid framework for understanding the objectives, loss functions, and optimisation challenges inherent to GAN training. Subsequent chapters review classic variants such as Conditional GANs, DCGANs, InfoGAN, and LAPGAN before progressing to advanced training methodologies like Wasserstein GANs, GANs with gradient penalty, least squares GANs, and spectral normalisation techniques. The book further examines architectural enhancements and task-specific adaptations in generators and discriminators, showcasing practical implementations in high resolution image generation, artistic style transfer, video synthesis, text to image generation and other multimedia applications. The concluding sections offer insights into emerging research trends, including self-attention mechanisms, transformer-based generative models, and a comparative analysis with diffusion models, thus charting promising directions for future developments in both academic and applied settings.</description>

      <title>Building Rome with Convex Optimization</title>

Abstract: Global bundle adjustment is made easy by depth prediction and convex optimization. We (i) propose a scaled bundle adjustment (SBA) formulation that lifts 2D keypoint measurements to 3D with learned depth, (ii) design an empirically tight convex semidfinite program (SDP) relaxation that solves SBA to certfiable global optimality, (iii) solve the SDP relaxations at extreme scale with Burer-Monteiro factorization and a CUDA-based trust-region Riemannian optimizer (dubbed XM), (iv) build a structure from motion (SfM) pipeline with XM as the optimization engine and show that XM-SfM dominates or compares favorably with existing SfM pipelines in terms of reconstruction quality while being faster, more scalable, and initialization-free.</description>
