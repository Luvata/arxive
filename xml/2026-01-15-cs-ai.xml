      <title>Bridging the Trust Gap: Clinician-Validated Hybrid Explainable AI for Maternal Health Risk Assessment in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare.</description>

      <title>Executable Ontologies in Game Development: From Algorithmic Control to Semantic World Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybased task interruption through dataflow conditions rather than explicit preemption logic. Comparison with Behavior Trees (BT) and Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) reveals that while these approaches model what agents should do, EO models when actions become possible - a fundamental difference that addresses the semantic-process gap in game AI architecture. We discuss integration strategies, debugging advantages inherent to temporal event graphs, and the potential for LLM-driven runtime model generation.</description>

      <title>When Models Know When They Do Not Know: Calibration, Cascading, and Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a model knows when it does not know, many possibilities emerge. The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.</description>

      <title>Reasoning over Precedents Alongside Statutes: Case-Augmented Deliberative Alignment for LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) adhere to safety principles without refusing benign requests remains a significant challenge. While OpenAI introduces deliberative alignment (DA) to enhance the safety of its o-series models through reasoning over detailed ``code-like'' safety rules, the effectiveness of this approach in open-source LLMs, which typically lack advanced reasoning capabilities, is understudied. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains. CADA effectively enhances harmlessness, improves robustness against attacks, and reduces over-refusal while preserving utility across diverse benchmarks, offering a practical alternative to rule-only DA for improving safety while maintaining helpfulness.</description>

      <title>Internal Deployment Gaps in AI Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier AI regulations primarily focus on systems deployed to external users, where deployment is more visible and subject to outside scrutiny. However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\&amp;D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight. We then analyze why these gaps persist, examining tensions around measurability, incentives, and information access. Finally, we map potential approaches to address them and their associated tradeoffs. By understanding these patterns, we hope that policy choices around internally deployed AI systems can be made deliberately rather than incidentally.</description>

      <title>Integrating Attendance Tracking and Emotion Detection for Enhanced Student Engagement in Smart Classrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of smart classroom technologies in higher education has mainly focused on automating attendance, with limited attention given to students' emotional and cognitive engagement during lectures. This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.</description>

      <title>Forecast Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Electricity Load Scheduling in Dairy Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dairy farming is an energy intensive sector that relies heavily on grid electricity. With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.</description>

      <title>A New Strategy for Verifying Reach-Avoid Specifications in Neural Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward reachability analysis is the predominant approach for verifying reach-avoid properties in neural feedback systems (dynamical systems controlled by neural networks). This dominance stems from the limited scalability of existing backward reachability methods. In this work, we introduce new algorithms that compute both over- and under-approximations of backward reachable sets for such systems. We further integrate these backward algorithms with established forward analysis techniques to yield a unified verification framework for neural feedback systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Gravity Wells: Why Negative Constraints Backfire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative constraints (instructions of the form "do not use word X") represent a fundamental test of instruction-following capability in large language models. Despite their apparent simplicity, these constraints fail with striking regularity, and the conditions governing failure have remained poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive mechanistic investigation of negative instruction failure. We introduce semantic pressure, a quantitative measure of the model's intrinsic probability of generating the forbidden token, and demonstrate that violation probability follows a tight logistic relationship with pressure ($p=\sigma(-2.40+2.27\cdot P_0)$; $n=40{,}000$ samples; bootstrap $95%$ CI for slope: $[2.21,,2.33]$). Through layer-wise analysis using the logit lens technique, we establish that the suppression signal induced by negative instructions is present but systematically weaker in failures: the instruction reduces target probability by only 5.2 percentage points in failures versus 22.8 points in successes -- a $4.4\times$ asymmetry. We trace this asymmetry to two mechanistically distinct failure modes. In priming failure (87.5% of violations), the instruction's explicit mention of the forbidden word paradoxically activates rather than suppresses the target representation. In override failure (12.5%), late-layer feed-forward networks generate contributions of $+0.39$ toward the target probability -- nearly $4\times$ larger than in successes -- overwhelming earlier suppression signals. Activation patching confirms that layers 23--27 are causally responsible: replacing these layers' activations flips the sign of constraint effects. These findings reveal a fundamental tension in negative constraint design: the very act of naming a forbidden word primes the model to produce it.</description>

      <title>MemoBrain: Executive Memory as an Agentic Brain for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex reasoning in tool-augmented agent frameworks is inherently long-horizon, causing reasoning traces and transient tool artifacts to accumulate and strain the bounded working context of large language models. Without explicit memory mechanisms, such accumulation disrupts logical continuity and undermines task alignment. This positions memory not as an auxiliary efficiency concern, but as a core component for sustaining coherent, goal-directed reasoning over long horizons.
  We propose MemoBrain, an executive memory model for tool-augmented agents that constructs a dependency-aware memory over reasoning steps, capturing salient intermediate states and their logical relations. Operating as a co-pilot alongside the reasoning agent, MemoBrain organizes reasoning progress without blocking execution and actively manages the working context. Specifically, it prunes invalid steps, folds completed sub-trajectories, and preserves a compact, high-salience reasoning backbone under a fixed context budget. Together, these mechanisms enable explicit cognitive control over reasoning trajectories rather than passive context accumulation.
  We evaluate MemoBrain on challenging long-horizon benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalker, and BrowseComp-Plus, demonstrating consistent improvements over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>MirrorBench: An Extensible Framework to Evaluate User-Proxy Agents for Human-Likeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive "act-as-a-user" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports. The framework can be accessed at https://github.com/SAP/mirrorbench.</description>

      <title>How vehicles change lanes after encountering crashes: Empirical analysis and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.</description>

      <title>Embedded AI Companion System on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational resource constraints on edge devices make it difficult to develop a fully embedded AI companion system with a satisfactory user experience. AI companion and memory systems detailed in existing literature cannot be directly used in such an environment due to lack of compute resources and latency concerns. In this paper, we propose a memory paradigm that alternates between active and inactive phases: during phases of user activity, the system performs low-latency, real-time dialog using lightweight retrieval over existing memories and context; whereas during phases of user inactivity, it conducts more computationally intensive extraction, consolidation, and maintenance of memories across full conversation sessions. This design minimizes latency while maintaining long-term personalization under the tight constraints of embedded hardware. We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window.</description>

      <title>Project Synapse: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework with Hybrid Memory for Autonomous Resolution of Last-Mile Delivery Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Project Synapse, a novel agentic framework designed for the autonomous resolution of last-mile delivery disruptions. Synapse employs a hierarchical multi-agent architecture in which a central Resolution Supervisor agent performs strategic task decomposition and delegates subtasks to specialized worker agents responsible for tactical execution. The system is orchestrated using LangGraph to manage complex and cyclical workflows. To validate the framework, a benchmark dataset of 30 complex disruption scenarios was curated from a qualitative analysis of over 6,000 real-world user reviews. System performance is evaluated using an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol with explicit bias mitigation.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and task-to-core allocation are critical for thermal management and balancing energy and performance in embedded systems. Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor. First-decision latency is 8,300x faster than table-based profiling, enabling practical deployment in dynamic embedded systems.</description>

      <title>The Agent's First Day: Benchmarking Learning, Exploration, and Scheduling in the Workplace Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a "trainee" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

      <title>Improving LLM Reasoning with Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Text-Attributed Graph Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) understanding. Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes. Extensive experiments on 10 node-level benchmarks across LLMs of varying sizes and families demonstrate that, by feeding LLMs with structurally and semantically compressed inputs, HS2C simultaneously enhances the compression rate and downstream inference accuracy, validating its superiority and scalability. Extensions to 7 diverse graph-level benchmarks further consolidate HS2C's task generalizability.</description>

      <title>Adapting Rules of Official International Mahjong for Online Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the worldwide spread traditional game, Official International Mahjong can be played and promoted online through remote devices instead of requiring face-to-face interaction. However, online players have fragmented playtime and unfixed combination of opponents in contrary to offline players who have fixed opponents for multiple rounds of play. Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players. This work is an initial attempt to use data from AI systems to evaluate Official Internatinoal Mahjong's game balance and develop a revised version of the traditional game better adapted for online players.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Approach to General Intelligence: SANC(E3) -- Self-organizing Active Network of Concepts with Energy E3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General intelligence must reorganize experience into internal structures that enable prediction and action under finite resources. Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input. As a result, perception, imagination, prediction, planning, and action are unified within a single representational and energetic process. From the axioms, twelve propositions are derived, showing that category formation, hierarchical organization, unsupervised learning, and high-level cognitive activities can all be understood as instances of Gestalt completion under E3 minimization.</description>

      <title>MPCI-Bench: A Benchmark for Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity Evaluation of Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language-model agents evolve from passive chatbots into proactive assistants that handle personal data, evaluating their adherence to social norms becomes increasingly critical, often through the lens of Contextual Integrity (CI). However, existing CI benchmarks are largely text-centric and primarily emphasize negative refusal scenarios, overlooking multimodal privacy risks and the fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility. In this paper, we introduce MPCI-Bench, the first Multimodal Pairwise Contextual Integrity benchmark for evaluating privacy behavior in agentic settings. MPCI-Bench consists of paired positive and negative instances derived from the same visual source and instantiated across three tiers: normative Seed judgments, context-rich Story reasoning, and executable agent action Traces. Data quality is ensured through a Tri-Principle Iterative Refinement pipeline. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal models reveal systematic failures to balance privacy and utility and a pronounced modality leakage gap, where sensitive visual information is leaked more frequently than textual information. We will open-source MPCI-Bench to facilitate future research on agentic CI.</description>

      <title>The End of Reward Engineering: How LLMs Are Redefining Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward engineering, the manual specification of reward functions to induce desired agent behavior, remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large AI Model (LAM) have been proposed to applications of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), that offer better performance with its great generalization and reduced task specific trainings. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that is guided by a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM operates as a high level coordinator that generates textual guidance that shape the reward of the DRL agent during training. The results show that the LAM-DRL outperforms the traditional DRL by 40% in nominal weather scenarios and 64% in extreme weather scenarios compared to heuristics in terms of throughput, fairness, and outage probability.</description>

      <title>T3: Benchmarking Sycophancy and Skepticism in Causal Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce T3 (Testing Trustworthy Thinking), a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLM causal judgment across Pearl's Ladder of Causality. Comprising 454 expert-curated vignettes, T3 prioritizes high-resolution failure analysis, decomposing performance into Utility (sensitivity), Safety (specificity), and Wise Refusal on underdetermined cases. By applying T3 to frontier models, we diagnose two distinct pathologies: a "Skepticism Trap" at L1 (where safety-tuned models like Claude Haiku reject 60% of valid links) and a non-monotonic Scaling Paradox at L3. In the latter, the larger GPT-5.2 underperforms GPT-4-Turbo by 55 points on ambiguous counterfactuals, driven by a collapse into paralysis (excessive hedging) rather than hallucination. Finally, we use the benchmark to validate a process-verified protocol (RCA), showing that T3 successfully captures the restoration of decisive causal judgment under structured verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand gesture recognition is an important aspect of human-computer interaction. It forms the basis of sign language for the visually impaired people. This work proposes a novel hand gesture recognizing system for the differently-abled persons. The model uses a convolutional neural network, known as VGG-16 net, for building a trained model on a widely used image dataset by employing Python and Keras libraries. Furthermore, the result is validated by the NUS dataset, consisting of 10 classes of hand gestures, fed to the model as the validation set. Afterwards, a testing dataset of 10 classes is built by employing Google's open source Application Programming Interface (API) that captures different gestures of human hand and the efficacy is then measured by carrying out experiments. The experimental results show that by combining a transfer learning mechanism together with the image data augmentation, the VGG-16 net produced around 98% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sparsity Is Necessary: Polynomial-Time Stability for Agentic LLMs in Large Action Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool-augmented LLM systems expose a control regime that learning theory has largely ignored: sequential decision-making with a massive discrete action universe (tools, APIs, documents) in which only a small, unknown subset is relevant for any fixed task distribution. We formalize this setting as Sparse Agentic Control (SAC), where policies admit block-sparse representations over M &gt;&gt; 1 actions and rewards depend on sparse main effects and (optionally) sparse synergies. We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T &gt; k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M. Extensions cover tuning-free, online, robust, group-sparse, and interaction-aware SAC.</description>

      <title>ToolACE-MCP: Generalizing History-Aware Routing from MCP Tools to the Agent Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of the Agent Web and Model Context Protocol (MCP), the agent ecosystem is evolving into an open collaborative network, exponentially increasing accessible tools. However, current architectures face severe scalability and generality bottlenecks. To address this, we propose ToolACE-MCP, a pipeline for training history-aware routers to empower precise navigation in large-scale ecosystems. By leveraging a dependency-rich candidate Graph to synthesize multi-turn trajectories, we effectively train routers with dynamic context understanding to create the plug-and-play Light Routing Agent. Experiments on the real-world benchmarks MCP-Universe and MCP-Mark demonstrate superior performance. Notably, ToolACE-MCP exhibits critical properties for the future Agent Web: it not only generalizes to multi-agent collaboration with minimal adaptation but also maintains exceptional robustness against noise and scales effectively to massive candidate spaces. These findings provide a strong empirical foundation for universal orchestration in open-ended ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Greedy Is Enough: Sparse Action Discovery in Agentic LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern agentic systems operate in environments with extremely large action spaces, such as tool-augmented language models with thousands of available APIs or retrieval operations. Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.
  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.
  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability. Together, our results identify sparse action discovery as a fundamental principle underlying large-action decision-making and provide a theoretical foundation for action pruning in agentic systems.</description>

      <title>OpenMic: A Multi-Agent-Based Stand-Up Comedy Generation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese stand-up comedy generation goes beyond plain text generation, requiring culturally grounded humor, precise timing, stage-performance cues, and implicit multi-step reasoning. Moreover, commonly used Chinese humor datasets are often better suited for humor understanding and evaluation than for long-form stand-up generation, making direct supervision misaligned with the target task. To address these challenges, we present OpenMic, an end-to-end multi-agent system built on AutoGen that transforms a user-provided life topic into a 3-5 minute Chinese stand-up performance and further produces a narrated comedy video. OpenMic orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a multi-round iterative loop-planning to jointly optimize humor, timing, and performability. To mitigate the dataset-task mismatch, we augment generation with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for material grounding and idea expansion, and we fine-tune a dedicated JokeWriter to better internalize stand-up-specific setup-punchline structures and long-range callbacks.</description>

      <title>AtomMem : Learnable Dynamic Agentic Memory with Atomic Memory Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipping agents with memory is essential for solving real-world long-horizon problems. However, most existing agent memory mechanisms rely on static and hand-crafted workflows. This limits the performance and generalization ability of these memory designs, which highlights the need for a more flexible, learning-based memory framework. In this paper, we propose AtomMem, which reframes memory management as a dynamic decision-making problem. We deconstruct high-level memory processes into fundamental atomic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, transforming the memory workflow into a learnable decision process. By combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, AtomMem learns an autonomous, task-aligned policy to orchestrate memory behaviors tailored to specific task demands. Experimental results across 3 long-context benchmarks demonstrate that the trained AtomMem-8B consistently outperforms prior static-workflow memory methods. Further analysis of training dynamics shows that our learning-based formulation enables the agent to discover structured, task-aligned memory management strategies, highlighting a key advantage over predefined routines.</description>

      <title>Semantic Laundering in AI Agent Architectures: Why Tool Boundaries Do Not Confer Epistemic Warrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based agent architectures systematically conflate information transport mechanisms with epistemic justification mechanisms. We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Pre-training: Knowledge Attribution Analysis in MoE and Dense Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decouple model capacity from per-token computation, enabling scaling beyond the computational limits imposed by dense scaling laws. Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within &lt; 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by &lt; 10%, compared with &gt; 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.</description>

      <title>Creativity in AI as Emergence from Domain-Limited Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity in artificial intelligence is most often addressed through evaluative frameworks that aim to measure novelty, diversity, or usefulness in generated outputs. While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.</description>

      <title>Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO): A Principled RL Algorithm for Generative Search LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&amp;M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web Agents are increasingly deployed to perform complex tasks in real web environments, yet their security evaluation remains fragmented and difficult to standardize. We present WebTrap Park, an automated platform for systematic security evaluation of Web Agents through direct observation of their concrete interactions with live web pages. WebTrap Park instantiates three major sources of security risk into 1,226 executable evaluation tasks and enables action based assessment without requiring agent modification. Our results reveal clear security differences across agent frameworks, highlighting the importance of agent architecture beyond the underlying model. WebTrap Park is publicly accessible at https://security.fudan.edu.cn/webagent and provides a scalable foundation for reproducible Web Agent security evaluation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Distillation with CoT Guidance for Edge-Drone Control Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs</description>

      <title>RubricHub: A Comprehensive and Highly Discriminative Rubric Dataset via Automated Coarse-to-Fine Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has driven substantial progress in reasoning-intensive domains like mathematics. However, optimizing open-ended generation remains challenging due to the lack of ground truth. While rubric-based evaluation offers a structured proxy for verification, existing methods suffer from scalability bottlenecks and coarse criteria, resulting in a supervision ceiling effect. To address this, we propose an automated Coarse-to-Fine Rubric Generation framework. By synergizing principle-guided synthesis, multi-model aggregation, and difficulty evolution, our approach produces comprehensive and highly discriminative criteria capable of capturing the subtle nuances. Based on this framework, we introduce RubricHub, a large-scale ($\sim$110k) and multi-domain dataset. We validate its utility through a two-stage post-training pipeline comprising Rubric-based Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RuFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RuRL). Experimental results demonstrate that RubricHub unlocks significant performance gains: our post-trained Qwen3-14B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on HealthBench (69.3), surpassing proprietary frontier models such as GPT-5. The code and data will be released soon.</description>

      <title>YaPO: Learnable Sparse Activation Steering Vectors for Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering Large Language Models (LLMs) through activation interventions has emerged as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for alignment and personalization. Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \textit{reference-free} method that learns \textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking. Importantly, YaPO preserves general knowledge, with no measurable degradation on MMLU. Overall, our results show that YaPO provides a general recipe for efficient, stable, and fine-grained alignment of LLMs, with broad applications to controllability and domain adaptation. The associated code and data are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/YaPO}.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linearization: Attributed Table Graphs for Table Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table reasoning, a task to answer questions by reasoning over data presented in tables, is an important topic due to the prevalence of knowledge stored in tabular formats. Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the "lost-in-the-middle" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy. Our code will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>An Under-Explored Application for Explainable Multimodal Misogyny Detection in code-mixed Hindi-English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital platforms have an ever-expanding user base, and act as a hub for communication, business, and connectivity. However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space. The system has been evaluated using human evaluators who provided their responses on Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.</description>

      <title>M3-BENCH: Process-Aware Evaluation of LLM Agents Social Behaviors in Mixed-Motive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents continue to advance, their advanced social behaviors, such as cooperation, deception, and collusion, call for systematic evaluation. However, existing benchmarks often emphasize a single capability dimension or rely solely on behavioral outcomes, overlooking rich process information from agents' decision reasoning and communicative interactions. To address this gap, we propose M3-Bench, a multi-stage benchmark for mixed-motive games, together with a process-aware evaluation framework that conducts synergistic analysis across three modules: BTA (Behavioral Trajectory Analysis), RPA (Reasoning Process Analysis), and CCA (Communication Content Analysis). Furthermore, we integrate the Big Five personality model and Social Exchange Theory to aggregate multi-dimensional evidence into interpretable social behavior portraits, thereby characterizing agents' personality traits and capability profiles beyond simple task scores or outcome-based metrics. Experimental results show that M3-Bench can reliably distinguish diverse social behavior competencies across models, and it reveals that some models achieve seemingly reasonable behavioral outcomes while exhibiting pronounced inconsistencies in their reasoning and communication.</description>

Abstract: This paper incorporates the efficiency of automatic summarization and addresses the challenge of generating personalized summaries tailored to individual users' interests and requirements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SummPilot, an interaction-based customizable summarization system. SummPilot leverages a large language model to facilitate both automatic and interactive summarization. Users can engage with the system to understand document content and personalize summaries through interactive components such as semantic graphs, entity clustering, and explainable evaluation.

      <title>What If TSF: A Benchmark for Reframing Forecasting as Scenario-Guided Multimodal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical to real-world decision making, yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and rely on extrapolating historical patterns. While recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights the potential for multimodal forecasting, existing benchmarks largely provide retrospective or misaligned raw context, making it unclear whether such models meaningfully leverage textual inputs. In practice, human experts incorporate what-if scenarios with historical evidence, often producing distinct forecasts from the same observations under different scenarios. Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios. By providing expert-crafted plausible or counterfactual scenarios, WIT offers a rigorous testbed for scenario-guided multimodal forecasting. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/jinkwan1115/WhatIfTSF.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facade renovation offers a more sustainable alternative to full demolition, yet producing design proposals that preserve existing structures while expressing new intent remains challenging. Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.</description>

      <title>Learner-Tailored Program Repair: A Solution Generator with Iterative Edit-Driven Retrieval Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.</description>

      <title>WaterCopilot: An AI-Driven Virtual Assistant for Water Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable water resource management in transboundary river basins is challenged by fragmented data, limited real-time access, and the complexity of integrating diverse information sources. This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts. The study demonstrates the potential of this AI assistant to support informed, timely decision-making and strengthen water security in complex river basins.</description>

      <title>ViDoRe V3: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation in Complex Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines must address challenges beyond simple single-document retrieval, such as interpreting visual elements (tables, charts, images), synthesizing information across documents, and providing accurate source grounding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture this complexity, often focusing on textual data, single-document comprehension, or evaluating retrieval and generation in isolation. We introduce ViDoRe v3, a comprehensive multimodal RAG benchmark featuring multi-type queries over visually rich document corpora. It covers 10 datasets across diverse professional domains, comprising ~26,000 document pages paired with 3,099 human-verified queries, each available in 6 languages. Through 12,000 hours of human annotation effort, we provide high-quality annotations for retrieval relevance, bounding box localization, and verified reference answers. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG pipelines reveals that visual retrievers outperform textual ones, late-interaction models and textual reranking substantially improve performance, and hybrid or purely visual contexts enhance answer generation quality. However, current models still struggle with non-textual elements, open-ended queries, and fine-grained visual grounding. To encourage progress in addressing these challenges, the benchmark is released under a commercially permissive license at https://hf.co/vidore.</description>

      <title>Resisting Manipulative Bots in Memecoin Copy Trading: A Multi-Agent Approach with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The launch of \$Trump coin ignited a wave in meme coin investment. Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions. Using a dataset of 1,000 meme coin projects' transaction data, our empirical evaluation shows that the proposed multi-agent system outperforms both traditional machine learning models and single LLMs, achieving 73% and 70% precision in identifying high-quality meme coin projects and key opinion leader (KOL) wallets, respectively. The selected KOLs collectively generated a total profit of \$500,000 across these projects.</description>

      <title>Prism: Towards Lowering User Cognitive Load in LLMs via Complex Intent Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.</description>

      <title>Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation faces a trade-off: concatenating documents in a long prompt enables multi-document reasoning but creates prefill bottlenecks, while encoding document KV caches separately offers speed but breaks cross-document interaction. We propose Parallel Context-of-Experts Decoding (Pced), a training-free framework that shifts evidence aggregation from the attention mechanism to the decoding. Pced treats retrieved documents as isolated "experts", synchronizing their predictions via a novel retrieval-aware contrastive decoding rule that weighs expert logits against the model prior. This approach recovers cross-document reasoning capabilities without constructing a shared attention across documents.</description>

      <title>Why AI Alignment Failure Is Structural: Learned Human Interaction Structures and AGI as an Endogenous Evolutionary Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of large language models (LLMs) exhibiting behaviors such as deception, threats, or blackmail are often interpreted as evidence of alignment failure or emergent malign agency. We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.</description>

      <title>Advancing ESG Intelligence: An Expert-level Agent and Comprehensive Benchmark for Sustainable Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are essential for evaluating corporate sustainability and ethical performance. However, professional ESG analysis is hindered by data fragmentation across unstructured sources, and existing large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the complex, multi-step workflows required for rigorous auditing. To address these limitations, we introduce ESGAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent system empowered by a specialized toolset, including retrieval augmentation, web search and domain-specific functions, to generate in-depth ESG analysis. Complementing this agentic system, we present a comprehensive three-level benchmark derived from 310 corporate sustainability reports, designed to evaluate capabilities ranging from atomic common-sense questions to the generation of integrated, in-depth analysis. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ESGAgent outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs with an average accuracy of 84.15% on atomic question-answering tasks, and excels in professional report generation by integrating rich charts and verifiable references. These findings confirm the diagnostic value of our benchmark, establishing it as a vital testbed for assessing general and advanced agentic capabilities in high-stakes vertical domains.</description>

      <title>PersonaDual: Balancing Personalization and Objectivity via Adaptive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As users increasingly expect LLMs to align with their preferences, personalized information becomes valuable. However, personalized information can be a double-edged sword: it can improve interaction but may compromise objectivity and factual correctness, especially when it is misaligned with the question. To alleviate this problem, we propose PersonaDual, a framework that supports both general-purpose objective reasoning and personalized reasoning in a single model, and adaptively switches modes based on context. PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection. Experiments on objective and personalized benchmarks show that PersonaDual preserves the benefits of personalization while reducing interference, achieving near interference-free performance and better leveraging helpful personalized signals to improve objective problem-solving.</description>

      <title>MEMEWEAVER: Inter-Meme Graph Reasoning for Sexism and Misogyny Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Women are twice as likely as men to face online harassment due to their gender. Despite recent advances in multimodal content moderation, most approaches still overlook the social dynamics behind this phenomenon, where perpetrators reinforce prejudices and group identity within like-minded communities. Graph-based methods offer a promising way to capture such interactions, yet existing solutions remain limited by heuristic graph construction, shallow modality fusion, and instance-level reasoning. In this work, we present MemeWeaver, an end-to-end trainable multimodal framework for detecting sexism and misogyny through a novel inter-meme graph reasoning mechanism. We systematically evaluate multiple visual--textual fusion strategies and show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the MAMI and EXIST benchmarks, while achieving faster training convergence. Further analyses reveal that the learned graph structure captures semantically meaningful patterns, offering valuable insights into the relational nature of online hate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational AI is starting to support real clinical work, but most evaluation methods miss how compliance depends on the full course of a conversation. We introduce Obligatory-Information Phase Structured Compliance Evaluation (OIP-SCE), an evaluation method that checks whether every required clinical obligation is met, in the right order, with clear evidence for clinicians to review. This makes complex rules practical and auditable, helping close the gap between technical progress and what healthcare actually needs. We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps. By giving clinicians control over what to check and engineers a clear specification to implement, OIP-SCE provides a single, auditable evaluation surface that aligns AI capability with clinical workflow and supports routine, safe use.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Ability of Explanations to Disambiguate Models in a Rashomon Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is concerned with producing explanations indicating the inner workings of models. For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment. However explanations themselves can vary depending on the explainer used, and need to be evaluated. In the paper "Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method "AXE" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.</description>

      <title>Learning from Demonstrations via Capability-Aware Goal Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its promise, imitation learning often fails in long-horizon environments where perfect replication of demonstrations is unrealistic and small errors can accumulate catastrophically. We introduce Cago (Capability-Aware Goal Sampling), a novel learning-from-demonstrations method that mitigates the brittle dependence on expert trajectories for direct imitation. Unlike prior methods that rely on demonstrations only for policy initialization or reward shaping, Cago dynamically tracks the agent's competence along expert trajectories and uses this signal to select intermediate steps--goals that are just beyond the agent's current reach--to guide learning. This results in an adaptive curriculum that enables steady progress toward solving the full task. Empirical results demonstrate that Cago significantly improves sample efficiency and final performance across a range of sparse-reward, goal-conditioned tasks, consistently outperforming existing learning from-demonstrations baselines.</description>

      <title>AI as Entertainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI systems are predominantly designed, evaluated, and marketed as intelligent systems which will benefit society by augmenting or automating human cognitive labor, promising to increase personal, corporate, and macroeconomic productivity. But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose "thick entertainment" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about "intelligence" as social media is about social connection.</description>

      <title>Pervasive Annotation Errors Break Text-to-SQL Benchmarks and Leaderboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous text-to-SQL techniques to streamline data analytics and accelerate the development of database-driven applications. To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.
  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

      <title>Uncovering Political Bias in Large Language Models using Parliamentary Voting Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in digital platforms and decision-making systems, concerns about their political biases have grown. While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshift Estimation Using Scaled Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of the state-of-the-art telescopic systems capable of performing expansive sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Euclid, and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) has significantly advanced efforts to refine cosmological models. These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document. Evaluation metrics include catastrophic outlier, bias, and rms.</description>

      <title>A survey: Information search time optimization based on RAG (Retrieval Augmentation Generation) chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbots are not only useful for information retrieval through questionanswering but also for making complex decisions based on injected private data.we present a survey on how much search time can be saved when retrieving complex information within an organization called "X Systems"(a stealth mode company) by using a RAG-based chatbot compared to traditional search methods. We compare the information retrieval time using standard search techniques versus the RAG-based chatbot for the same queries. Our results conclude that RAG-based chatbots not only save time in information retrieval but also optimize the search process effectively. This survey was conducted with a sample of 105 employees across departments, average time spending on information retrieval per query was taken as metric. Comparison shows us, there are average 80-95% improvement on search when use RAG based chatbot than using standard search.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low Rank Compression of LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual matrix. A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once). HSS is hardware-friendly: its matrix-vector multiply reduces to one sparse and a sequence of thin-matrix multiplications and can be trained end-to-end with standard optimisers.
  Experiments on LLaMA-7B show that targeting only the self-attention projections (1.6 B parameters of Q, K, and V matrices out of a total 7B parameters) suffices to yield large memory savings while retaining comparable state-of-the-art perplexity scores on test samples of the WikiText dataset. For example, with a 30\% sparsity budget and an outer rank of 512, sHSS-RCM achieves a perplexity of 1.64, outperforming dense baselines and classical sparse-plus-SVD variants, while also achieving significant memory savings.</description>

      <title>FinVault: Benchmarking Financial Agent Safety in Execution-Grounded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for investment analysis, risk assessment, and automated decision-making, where their abilities to plan, invoke tools, and manipulate mutable state introduce new security risks in high-stakes and highly regulated financial environments. However, existing safety evaluations largely focus on language-model-level content compliance or abstract agent settings, failing to capture execution-grounded risks arising from real operational workflows and state-changing actions. To bridge this gap, we propose FinVault, the first execution-grounded security benchmark for financial agents, comprising 31 regulatory case-driven sandbox scenarios with state-writable databases and explicit compliance constraints, together with 107 real-world vulnerabilities and 963 test cases that systematically cover prompt injection, jailbreaking, financially adapted attacks, as well as benign inputs for false-positive evaluation. Experimental results reveal that existing defense mechanisms remain ineffective in realistic financial agent settings, with average attack success rates (ASR) still reaching up to 50.0\% on state-of-the-art models and remaining non-negligible even for the most robust systems (ASR 6.7\%), highlighting the limited transferability of current safety designs and the need for stronger financial-specific defenses.

      <title>Immunological Density Shapes Recovery Trajectories in Long COVID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Long COVID) frequently persists for months, yet drivers of clinical remission remain incompletely defined.
  Here we analyzed 97,564 longitudinal PASC assessments from 13,511 participants with linked vaccination histories to disentangle passive temporal progression from vaccine-associated change.
  Using a clinically validated threshold (PASC $\geq 12$), trajectories separated into three phenotypes: Protected (persistently sub-threshold), Refractory (persistently symptomatic), and Responders (transitioning from symptomatic to recovered).
  Across the full cohort, symptom severity increased modestly with elapsed time ($r=0.0521$, $P=1.26\times10^{-59}$), whereas cumulative vaccination showed an inverse association with severity ($r=-0.0434$, $P=5.95\times10^{-42}$). In summary, baseline Long COVID severity appears clinically deterministic. In the absence of intervention, symptoms typically persist without spontaneous resolution. Recovery is primarily associated with repeated immunization.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Knowledge Transfer under Domain and Label Shifts in 3D LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For 3D perception systems to be practical in real-world applications -- from autonomous driving to embodied AI -- models must adapt to continuously evolving object definitions and sensor domains. Yet, research on continual and transfer learning in 3D point cloud perception remains underexplored compared to 2D vision -- particularly under simultaneous domain and label shifts. To address this gap, we propose the RObust Autonomous driving under Dataset shifts (ROAD) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite for LiDAR-based object classification that explicitly accounts for domain shifts as well as three key forms of label evolution: class split, class expansion, and class insertion. Using large-scale datasets (Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse2), we evaluate zero-shot transfer, linear probe, and CL, and analyze the impact of backbone architectures, training objectives, and CL methods. Our findings reveal limitations of existing approaches under realistic shifts and establish strong baselines for future research in robust 3D perception.</description>

      <title>Feature Entanglement-based Quantum Multimodal Fusion Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.</description>

      <title>Affect and Effect: Limitations of regularisation-based continual learning in EEG-based emotion classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p &gt; 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.</description>

      <title>RewriteNets: End-to-End Trainable String-Rewriting for Generative Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dominant sequence models like the Transformer represent structure implicitly through dense attention weights, incurring quadratic complexity. We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers. We also provide an analysis of learned rules and an extensive ablation study, demonstrating that this architecture presents a promising direction for sequence modeling with explicit structural inductive biases.</description>

      <title>Imaging-anchored Multiomics in Cardiovascular Disease: Integrating Cardiac Imaging, Bulk, Single-cell, and Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease arises from interactions between inherited risk, molecular programmes, and tissue-scale remodelling that are observed clinically through imaging. Health systems now routinely generate large volumes of cardiac MRI, CT and echocardiography together with bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, yet these data are still analysed in separate pipelines. This review examines joint representations that link cardiac imaging phenotypes to transcriptomic and spatially resolved molecular states. An imaging-anchored perspective is adopted in which echocardiography, cardiac MRI and CT define a spatial phenotype of the heart, and bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics provide cell-type- and location-specific molecular context. The biological and technical characteristics of these modalities are first summarised, and representation-learning strategies for each are outlined. Multimodal fusion approaches are reviewed, with emphasis on handling missing data, limited sample size, and batch effects. Finally, integrative pipelines for radiogenomics, spatial molecular alignment, and image-based prediction of gene expression are discussed, together with common failure modes, practical considerations, and open challenges. Spatial multiomics of human myocardium and atherosclerotic plaque, single-cell and spatial foundation models, and multimodal medical foundation models are collectively bringing imaging-anchored multiomics closer to large-scale cardiovascular translation.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently modify the internal knowledge of large language models (LLMs) without compromising their other capabilities. The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

      <title>NOVAK: Unified adaptive optimizer for deep neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces NOVAK, a modular gradient-based optimization algorithm that integrates adaptive moment estimation, rectified learning-rate scheduling, decoupled weight regularization, multiple variants of Nesterov momentum, and lookahead synchronization into a unified, performance-oriented framework. NOVAK adopts a dual-mode architecture consisting of a streamlined fast path designed for production. The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers. The results highlight that NOVAKs architectural contributions (particularly rectification, decoupled decay, and hybrid momentum) are crucial for reliable training of deep plain networks lacking skip connections, addressing a long-standing limitation of existing adaptive optimization methods.</description>

      <title>E^2-LLM: Bridging Neural Signals and Interpretable Affective Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emotion recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains challenging due to high inter-subject variability, limited labeled data, and the lack of interpretable reasoning in existing approaches. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm combining physiological signals with LLM reasoning capabilities, showing that model scaling improves both recognition accuracy and interpretable emotional understanding in affective computing.</description>

      <title>Sliced-Wasserstein Distribution Alignment Loss Improves the Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The benefits of most large language models come with steep and often hidden economic and environmental costs due to their resource usage inefficiency during deployment. Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>Sola-Visibility-ISPM: Benchmarking Agentic AI for Identity Security Posture Management Visibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity Security Posture Management (ISPM) is a core challenge for modern enterprises operating across cloud and SaaS environments. Answering basic ISPM visibility questions, such as understanding identity inventory and configuration hygiene, requires interpreting complex identity data, motivating growing interest in agentic AI systems. Despite this interest, there is currently no standardized way to evaluate how well such systems perform ISPM visibility tasks on real enterprise data. We introduce the Sola Visibility ISPM Benchmark, the first benchmark designed to evaluate agentic AI systems on foundational ISPM visibility tasks using a live, production-grade identity environment spanning AWS, Okta, and Google Workspace. The benchmark focuses on identity inventory and hygiene questions and is accompanied by the Sola AI Agent, a tool-using agent that translates natural-language queries into executable data exploration steps and produces verifiable, evidence-backed answers. Across 77 benchmark questions, the agent achieves strong overall performance, with an expert accuracy of 0.84 and a strict success rate of 0.77. Performance is highest on AWS hygiene tasks, where expert accuracy reaches 0.94, while results on Google Workspace and Okta hygiene tasks are more moderate, yet competitive. Overall, this work provides a practical and reproducible benchmark for evaluating agentic AI systems in identity security and establishes a foundation for future ISPM benchmarks covering more advanced identity analysis and governance tasks.</description>

      <title>Tackling Heterogeneity in Quantum Federated Learning: An Integrated Sporadic-Personalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Ideological Isolation in Online Social Networks: A Survey of Computational Definitions, Metrics, and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of online social networks has significantly reshaped the way individuals access and engage with information. While these platforms offer unprecedented connectivity, they may foster environments where users are increasingly exposed to homogeneous content and like-minded interactions. Such dynamics are associated with selective exposure and the emergence of filter bubbles, echo chambers, tunnel vision, and polarization, which together can contribute to ideological isolation and raise concerns about information diversity and public discourse. This survey provides a comprehensive computational review of existing studies that define, analyze, quantify, and mitigate ideological isolation in online social networks. We examine the mechanisms underlying content personalization, user behavior patterns, and network structures that reinforce content-exposure concentration and narrowing dynamics. This paper also systematically reviews methodological approaches for detecting and measuring these isolation-related phenomena, covering network-, content-, and behavior-based metrics. We further organize computational mitigation strategies, including network-topological interventions and recommendation-level controls, and discuss their trade-offs and deployment considerations. By integrating definitions, metrics, and interventions across structural/topological, content-based, interactional, and cognitive isolation, this survey provides a unified computational framework. It serves as a reference for understanding and addressing the key challenges and opportunities in promoting information diversity and reducing ideological fragmentation in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Small Symbols, Big Risks: Exploring Emoticon Semantic Confusion in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emoticons are widely used in digital communication to convey affective intent, yet their safety implications for Large Language Models (LLMs) remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify emoticon semantic confusion, a vulnerability where LLMs misinterpret ASCII-based emoticons to perform unintended and even destructive actions. To systematically study this phenomenon, we develop an automated data generation pipeline and construct a dataset containing 3,757 code-oriented test cases spanning 21 meta-scenarios, four programming languages, and varying contextual complexities. Our study on six LLMs reveals that emoticon semantic confusion is pervasive, with an average confusion ratio exceeding 38%. More critically, over 90% of confused responses yield 'silent failures', which are syntactically valid outputs but deviate from user intent, potentially leading to destructive security consequences. Furthermore, we observe that this vulnerability readily transfers to popular agent frameworks, while existing prompt-based mitigations remain largely ineffective. We call on the community to recognize this emerging vulnerability and develop effective mitigation methods to uphold the safety and reliability of the LLM system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing context lengths in transformer-based language models have made the key-value (KV) cache a critical inference bottleneck. While many KV cache pruning methods have been proposed, they have not yet been adopted in major inference engines due to speed--accuracy trade-offs. We introduce KVzap, a fast, input-adaptive approximation of KVzip that works in both prefilling and decoding. On Qwen3-8B, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Qwen3-32B across long-context and reasoning tasks, KVzap achieves $2$--$4\times$ KV cache compression with negligible accuracy loss and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KVpress leaderboard.

      <title>Sherry: Hardware-Efficient 1.25-Bit Ternary Quantization via Fine-grained Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices is increasingly hindered by prohibitive memory and computational requirements. While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

      <title>Revealing the Attention Floating Mechanism in Masked Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs), which leverage bidirectional attention and a denoising process, are narrowing the performance gap with autoregressive models (ARMs). However, their internal attention mechanisms remain under-explored. This paper investigates the attention behaviors in MDMs, revealing the phenomenon of Attention Floating. Unlike ARMs, where attention converges to a fixed sink, MDMs exhibit dynamic, dispersed attention anchors that shift across denoising steps and layers. Further analysis reveals its Shallow Structure-Aware, Deep Content-Focused attention mechanism: shallow layers utilize floating tokens to build a global structural framework, while deeper layers allocate more capability toward capturing semantic content. Empirically, this distinctive attention pattern provides a mechanistic explanation for the strong in-context learning capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to double the performance compared to ARMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/Attention-Floating.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently developed new advanced functionalities. Their effectiveness relies on statistical learning and generalization capabilities. However, they face limitations in internalizing the data they process and struggle, for instance, to autonomously execute algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of extending these models' capabilities to algorithm execution through specialized supervised training focused on reasoning decomposition. We introduce a training model called LLM-DAL (Large Language Model - Decompositional Algorithmic Learning), through which we demonstrate that LLMs' ability to perform complex algorithmic inferences and generalize can be significantly improved when the training method is properly designed to guide the model in its learning process.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Online Convex Optimization with Unknown Feedback Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), where multiple agents within a network collaboratively learn optimal decisions in real-time, arises naturally in applications such as federated learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent control.  In this paper, we study D-OCO under unknown, time-and agent-varying feedback delays. While recent work has addressed this problem (Nguyen et al., 2024), existing algorithms assume prior knowledge of the total delay over agents and still suffer from suboptimal dependence on both the delay and network parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel algorithm that achieves an improved regret bound of O N $\sqrt$ d tot + N $\sqrt$ T  (1-$\sigma$2) 1/4 , where T is the total horizon, d tot denotes the average total delay across agents, N is the number of agents, and 1 -$\sigma$ 2 is the spectral gap of the network. Our approach builds upon recent advances in D-OCO (Wan et al., 2024a), but crucially incorporates an adaptive learning rate mechanism via a decentralized communication protocol. This enables each agent to estimate delays locally using a gossip-based strategy without the prior knowledge of the total delay. We further extend our framework to the strongly convex setting and derive a sharper regret bound of O N $\delta$max ln T $\alpha$  , where $\alpha$ is the strong convexity parameter and $\delta$ max is the maximum number of missing observations averaged over agents. We also show that our upper bounds for both settings are tight up to logarithmic factors. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing improvements over existing benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Large Language Models for Time-Series Forecasting via Vector-Injected In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The World Wide Web needs reliable predictive capabilities to respond to changes in user behavior and usage patterns. Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Specialized Generalists: A Multi-Task MoE-LoRA Framework for Domain-Specific LLM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted focus from general-purpose capabilities to domain-specific expertise. However, adapting LLMs to specialized fields such as medicine presents two challenge: (1) the "Stability-Plasticity Dilemma", where the model must acquire complex clinical knowledge without suffering from catastrophic forgetting of general world knowledge; and (2) "Task Interference", where disparate sub-tasks, such as medical diagnosis, report summarization, and drug-drug interaction prediction, compete for limited low-rank parameter space. In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a "Knowledge-Preservation Plugin", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities.</description>

      <title>SECite: Analyzing and Summarizing Citations in Software Engineering Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the strengths and limitations of a research paper is a core component of any literature review. However, traditional summaries reflect only the authors' self-presented perspective. Analyzing how other researchers discuss and cite the paper can offer a deeper, more practical understanding of its contributions and shortcomings. In this research, we introduce SECite, a novel approach for evaluating scholarly impact through sentiment analysis of citation contexts. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract citations referencing nine research papers and apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with unsupervised machine learning to classify these citation statements as positive or negative. Beyond sentiment classification, we use generative AI to produce sentiment-specific summaries that capture the strengths and limitations of each target paper, derived both from clustered citation groups and from the full text. Our findings reveal meaningful patterns in how the academic community perceives these works, highlighting areas of alignment and divergence between external citation feedback and the authors' own presentation. By integrating citation sentiment analysis with LLM-based summarization, this study provides a comprehensive framework for assessing scholarly contributions.</description>

      <title>Moonworks Lunara Aesthetic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dataset spans diverse artistic styles, including regionally grounded aesthetics from the Middle East, Northern Europe, East Asia, and South Asia, alongside general categories such as sketch and oil painting. All images are generated using the Moonworks Lunara model and intentionally crafted to embody distinct, high-quality aesthetic styles, yielding a first-of-its-kind dataset with substantially higher aesthetic scores, exceeding even aesthetics-focused datasets, and general-purpose datasets by a larger margin. Each image is accompanied by a human-refined prompt and structured annotations that jointly describe salient objects, attributes, relationships, and stylistic cues. Unlike large-scale web-derived datasets that emphasize breadth over precision, the Lunara Aesthetic Dataset prioritizes aesthetic quality, stylistic diversity, and licensing transparency, and is released under the Apache 2.0 license to support research and unrestricted academic and commercial use.</description>

      <title>Coupled Diffusion-Encoder Models for Reconstruction of Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven flow-field reconstruction typically relies on autoencoder architectures that compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent representations. However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Methods for Neighborhood Selection in Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently gained traction as a means to improve combinatorial optimization methods, yet its effectiveness within local search metaheuristics specifically remains comparatively underexamined. In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $\epsilon$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $\epsilon$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SARIMA LSTM Model for Local Weather Forecasting: A Residual Learning Approach for Data Driven Meteorological Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting long-term atmospheric variables remains a defining challenge in meteorological science due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated theorem proving, or more broadly automated reasoning, aims at using computer programs to automatically prove or disprove mathematical theorems and logical statements. It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>LWMSCNN-SE: A Lightweight Multi-Scale Network for Efficient Maize Disease Classification on Edge Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maize disease classification plays a vital role in mitigating yield losses and ensuring food security. However, the deployment of traditional disease detection models in resource-constrained environments, such as those using smartphones and drones, faces challenges due to high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose LWMSCNN-SE, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates multi-scale feature extraction, depthwise separable convolutions, and squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention mechanisms. This novel combination enables the model to achieve 96.63% classification accuracy with only 241,348 parameters and 0.666 GFLOPs, making it suitable for real-time deployment in field applications. Our approach addresses the accuracy--efficiency trade-off by delivering high accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, demonstrating its potential for efficient maize disease diagnosis on edge devices in precision farming systems.</description>

      <title>LJ-Spoof: A Generatively Varied Corpus for Audio Anti-Spoofing and Synthesis Source Tracing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker-specific anti-spoofing and synthesis-source tracing are central challenges in audio anti-spoofing. Progress has been hampered by the lack of datasets that systematically vary model architectures, synthesis pipelines, and generative parameters. To address this gap, we introduce LJ-Spoof, a speaker-specific, generatively diverse corpus that systematically varies prosody, vocoders, generative hyperparameters, bona fide prompt sources, training regimes, and neural post-processing. The corpus spans one speakers-including studio-quality recordings-30 TTS families, 500 generatively variant subsets, 10 bona fide neural-processing variants, and more than 3 million utterances. This variation-dense design enables robust speaker-conditioned anti-spoofing and fine-grained synthesis-source tracing. We further position this dataset as both a practical reference training resource and a benchmark evaluation suite for anti-spoofing and source tracing.</description>

      <title>Tuberculosis Screening from Cough Audio: Baseline Models, Clinical Variables, and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a standardized framework for automatic tuberculosis (TB) detection from cough audio and routinely collected clinical data using machine learning. While TB screening from audio has attracted growing interest, progress is difficult to measure because existing studies vary substantially in datasets, cohort definitions, feature representations, model families, validation protocols, and reported metrics. Consequently, reported gains are often not directly comparable, and it remains unclear whether improvements stem from modeling advances or from differences in data and evaluation. We address this gap by establishing a strong, well-documented baseline for TB prediction using cough recordings and accompanying clinical metadata from a recently compiled dataset from several countries. Our pipeline is reproducible end-to-end, covering feature extraction, multimodal fusion, cougher-independent evaluation, and uncertainty quantification, and it reports a consistent suite of clinically relevant metrics to enable fair comparison. We further quantify performance for cough audio-only and fused (audio + clinical metadata) models, and release the full experimental protocol to facilitate benchmarking. This baseline is intended to serve as a common reference point and to reduce methodological variance that currently holds back progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Cultural Compass: A Framework for Organizing Societal Norms to Detect Violations in Human-AI Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI models ought to be useful and safe across cross-cultural contexts. One critical step toward this goal is understanding how AI models adhere to sociocultural norms. While this challenge has gained attention in NLP, existing work lacks both nuance and coverage in understanding and evaluating models' norm adherence. We address these gaps by introducing a taxonomy of norms that clarifies their contexts (e.g., distinguishing between human-human norms that models should recognize and human-AI interactional norms that apply to the human-AI interaction itself), specifications (e.g., relevant domains), and mechanisms (e.g., modes of enforcement). We demonstrate how our taxonomy can be operationalized to automatically evaluate models' norm adherence in naturalistic, open-ended settings. Our exploratory analyses suggest that state-of-the-art models frequently violate norms, though violation rates vary by model, interactional context, and country. We further show that violation rates also vary by prompt intent and situational framing. Our taxonomy and demonstrative evaluation pipeline enable nuanced, context-sensitive evaluation of cultural norm adherence in realistic settings.</description>

      <title>From Word Sequences to Behavioral Sequences: Adapting Modeling and Evaluation Paradigms for Longitudinal NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While NLP typically treats documents as independent and unordered samples, in longitudinal studies, this assumption rarely holds: documents are nested within authors and ordered in time, forming person-indexed, time-ordered $\textit{behavioral sequences}$. Here, we demonstrate the need for and propose a longitudinal modeling and evaluation paradigm that consequently updates four parts of the NLP pipeline: (1) evaluation splits aligned to generalization over people ($\textit{cross-sectional}$) and/or time ($\textit{prospective}$); (2) accuracy metrics separating between-person differences from within-person dynamics; (3) sequence inputs to incorporate history by default; and (4) model internals that support different $\textit{coarseness}$ of latent state over histories (pooled summaries, explicit dynamics, or interaction-based models). We demonstrate the issues ensued by traditional pipeline and our proposed improvements on a dataset of 17k daily diary transcripts paired with PTSD symptom severity from 238 participants, finding that traditional document-level evaluation can yield substantially different and sometimes reversed conclusions compared to our ecologically valid modeling and evaluation. We tie our results to a broader discussion motivating a shift from word-sequence evaluation toward $\textit{behavior-sequence}$ paradigms for NLP.</description>

      <title>DYCP: Dynamic Context Pruning for Long-Form Dialogue with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit increased response latency and degraded answer quality as dialogue length grows, making effective context management essential. However, existing methods rely on extra LLM calls to build memory or perform offline memory construction without considering the current user utterance, which can introduce inefficiencies or disrupt conversational continuity. We introduce DyCP, a lightweight context management method that dynamically segment and retrieve relevant memory at query time. It preserves the sequential structure of dialogue without predefined topic boundaries and supports efficient, adaptive context retrieval. Across three long-form dialogue benchmarks, LoCoMo, MT-Bench+, and SCM4LLMs, and multiple LLMs, DyCP consistently improves answer quality while reducing response latency. We also examine the gap between modern LLMs' expanded context windows and their actual long-context processing capacity, highlighting the continued importance of effective context management.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with creative generation, and multi-agent frameworks that improve reasoning through interaction can paradoxically hinder creativity by inducing content homogenization. We introduce LLM Review, a peer-review-inspired framework implementing Blind Peer Review: agents exchange targeted feedback while revising independently, preserving divergent creative trajectories. To enable rigorous evaluation, we propose SciFi-100, a science fiction writing dataset with a unified framework combining LLM-as-a-judge scoring, human annotation, and rule-based novelty metrics. Experiments demonstrate that LLM Review consistently outperforms multi-agent baselines, and smaller models with our framework can surpass larger single-agent models, suggesting interaction structure may substitute for model scale.</description>

We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.</description>

      <title>Representations of Text and Images Align From Layer One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a variety of concepts in adapter-based vision-language models, the representations of their images and their text descriptions are meaningfully aligned from the very first layer. This contradicts the established view that such image-text alignment only appears in late layers. We show this using a new synthesis-based method inspired by DeepDream: given a textual concept such as "Jupiter", we extract its concept vector at a given layer, and then use optimisation to synthesise an image whose representation aligns with that vector. We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis. Unlike previous methods for measuring multimodal alignment, our approach is simple, fast, and does not require auxiliary models or datasets. It also offers a new path towards model interpretability, by providing a way to visualise a model's representation space by backtracing through its image processing components.</description>

      <title>FigEx2: Visual-Conditioned Panel Detection and Captioning for Scientific Compound Figures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific compound figures combine multiple labeled panels into a single image, but captions in real pipelines are often missing or only provide figure-level summaries, making panel-level understanding difficult. In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>The Role of Noisy Data in Improving CNN Robustness for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data quality plays a central role in the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. While high-quality data is often preferred for training, real-world inputs are frequently affected by noise and other distortions. This paper investigates the effect of deliberately introducing controlled noise into the training data to improve model robustness. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the impact of three common corruptions, namely Gaussian noise, Salt-and-Pepper noise, and Gaussian blur at varying intensities and training set pollution levels. Experiments using a Resnet-18 model reveal that incorporating just 10\% noisy data during training is sufficient to significantly reduce test loss and enhance accuracy under fully corrupted test conditions, with minimal impact on clean-data performance. These findings suggest that strategic exposure to noise can act as a simple yet effective regularizer, offering a practical trade-off between traditional data cleanliness and real-world resilience.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Beyond Chain-of-Thought: A Latent Computational Mode in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has improved the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear why it works and whether it is the unique mechanism for triggering reasoning in large language models. In this work, we study this question by directly analyzing and intervening on the internal representations of LLMs with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), identifying a small set of latent features that are causally associated with LLM reasoning behavior. Across multiple model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that steering a single reasoning-related latent feature can substantially improve accuracy without explicit CoT prompting. For large models, latent steering achieves performance comparable to standard CoT prompting while producing more efficient outputs. We further observe that this reasoning-oriented internal state is triggered early in generation and can override prompt-level instructions that discourage explicit reasoning. Overall, our results suggest that multi-step reasoning in LLMs is supported by latent internal activations that can be externally activated, while CoT prompting is one effective, but not unique, way of activating this mechanism rather than its necessary cause.</description>

      <title>Q-realign: Piggybacking Realignment on Quantization for Safe and Efficient LLM Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public large language models (LLMs) are typically safety-aligned during pretraining, yet task-specific fine-tuning required for deployment often erodes this alignment and introduces safety risks. Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.</description>

      <title>Local-Global Feature Fusion for Subject-Independent EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subject-independent EEG emotion recognition is challenged by pronounced inter-subject variability and the difficulty of learning robust representations from short, noisy recordings. To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition. The code has been released at https://github.com/Danielz-z/LGF-EEG-Emotion.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Modeling of Stochastic Chemical Dynamics on Complex Manifolds: A Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN Framework for the Curvature-Perturbed Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate identification and control of spatiotemporal chaos in reaction-diffusion systems remains a grand challenge in chemical engineering, particularly when the underlying catalytic surface possesses complex, unknown topography. In the \textit{Defect Turbulence} regime, system dynamics are governed by topological phase singularities (spiral waves) whose motion couples to manifold curvature via geometric pinning. Conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using ReLU or Tanh activations suffer from fundamental \textit{spectral bias}, failing to resolve high-frequency gradients and causing amplitude collapse or phase drift. We propose a Multi-Scale SIREN-PINN architecture leveraging periodic sinusoidal activations with frequency-diverse initialization, embedding the appropriate inductive bias for wave-like physics directly into the network structure. This enables simultaneous resolution of macroscopic wave envelopes and microscopic defect cores. Validated on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation evolving on latent Riemannian manifolds, our architecture achieves relative state prediction error $\epsilon_{L_2} \approx 1.92 \times 10^{-2}$, outperforming standard baselines by an order of magnitude while preserving topological invariants ($|\Delta N_{defects}| &lt; 1$). We solve the ill-posed \textit{inverse pinning problem}, reconstructing hidden Gaussian curvature fields solely from partial observations of chaotic wave dynamics (Pearson correlation $\rho = 0.965$). Training dynamics reveal a distinctive Spectral Phase Transition at epoch $\sim 2,100$, where cooperative minimization of physics and geometry losses drives the solver to Pareto-optimal solutions. This work establishes a new paradigm for Geometric Catalyst Design, offering a mesh-free, data-driven tool for identifying surface heterogeneity and engineering passive control strategies in turbulent chemical reactors.</description>

      <title>STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Large Language Models via Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite notable advancements in prompting methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), existing strategies still suffer from excessive token usage and limited generalisability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Causal Prompting with Sketch-of-Thought (ACPS) framework, which leverages structural causal models to infer the causal effect of a query on its answer and adaptively select an appropriate intervention (i.e., standard front-door and conditional front-door adjustments). This design enables generalisable causal reasoning across heterogeneous tasks without task-specific retraining. By replacing verbose CoT with concise Sketch-of-Thought, ACPS enables efficient reasoning that significantly reduces token usage and inference cost. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that ACPS consistently outperforms existing prompting baselines in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>CSQL: Mapping Documents into Causal Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel system, CSQL, which automatically converts a collection of unstructured text documents into an SQL-queryable causal database (CDB). A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer "why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: "What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or "Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science.</description>

      <title>PathoGen: Diffusion-Based Synthesis of Realistic Lesions in Histopathology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust artificial intelligence models for histopathology diagnosis is severely constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated lesion data, particularly for rare pathologies and underrepresented disease subtypes. While data augmentation offers a potential solution, existing methods fail to generate sufficiently realistic lesion morphologies that preserve the complex spatial relationships and cellular architectures characteristic of histopathological tissues. Here we present PathoGen, a diffusion-based generative model that enables controllable, high-fidelity inpainting of lesions into benign histopathology images. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques, PathoGen leverages the iterative refinement process of diffusion models to synthesize lesions with natural tissue boundaries, preserved cellular structures, and authentic staining characteristics. We validate PathoGen across four diverse datasets representing distinct diagnostic challenges: kidney, skin, breast, and prostate pathology. Quantitative assessment confirms that PathoGen outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines, including conditional GAN and Stable Diffusion, in image fidelity and distributional similarity. Crucially, we show that augmenting training sets with PathoGen-synthesized lesions enhances downstream segmentation performance compared to traditional geometric augmentations, particularly in data-scarce regimes. Besides, by simultaneously generating realistic morphology and pixel-level ground truth, PathoGen effectively overcomes the manual annotation bottleneck. This approach offers a scalable pathway for developing generalizable medical AI systems despite limited expert-labeled data.</description>

      <title>How Do Optical Flow and Textual Prompts Collaborate to Assist in Audio-Visual Semantic Segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) represents an extension of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task, necessitating a semantic understanding of audio-visual scenes beyond merely identifying sound-emitting objects at the visual pixel level. Contrary to a previous methodology, by decomposing the AVSS task into two discrete subtasks by initially providing a prompted segmentation mask to facilitate subsequent semantic analysis, our approach innovates on this foundational strategy. We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \textit{S}tepping \textit{S}tone \textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow. Experimental results demonstrate that SSP outperforms existing AVS methods, delivering efficient and precise segmentation results.</description>

      <title>Subspace Alignment for Vision-Language Model Test-time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), despite their extraordinary zero-shot capabilities, are vulnerable to distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.</description>

      <title>Qalb: Largest State-of-the-Art Urdu Large Language Model for 230M Speakers with Systematic Continued Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in large language models, Urdu-a language spoken by over 230 million people-remains critically underrepresented in modern NLP systems. Existing multilingual models demonstrate poor performance on Urdu-specific tasks, struggling with the language's complex morphology, right-to-left Nastaliq script, and rich literary traditions. Even the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model shows limited capability in generating fluent, contextually appropriate Urdu text. We introduce Qalb, an Urdu language model developed through a two-stage approach: continued pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. Starting from LLaMA 3.1 8B, we perform continued pre-training on a dataset of 1.97 billion tokens. This corpus comprises 1.84 billion tokens of diverse Urdu text-spanning news archives, classical and contemporary literature, government documents, and social media-combined with 140 million tokens of English Wikipedia data to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We then fine-tune the resulting model on the Alif Urdu-instruct dataset. Through extensive evaluation on Urdu-specific benchmarks, Qalb demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a weighted average score of 90.34 and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art Alif-1.0-Instruct model (87.1) by 3.24 points, while also surpassing the base LLaMA-3.1 8B-Instruct model by 44.64 points. Qalb achieves state-of-the-art performance with comprehensive evaluation across seven diverse tasks including Classification, Sentiment Analysis, and Reasoning. Our results demonstrate that continued pre-training on diverse, high-quality language data, combined with targeted instruction fine-tuning, effectively adapts foundation models to low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms are Transferable: Data-Efficient Low-Resource Adaptation via Circuit-Targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adapting LLMs to low-resource languages is difficult: labeled data is scarce, full-model fine-tuning is unstable, and continued cross-lingual tuning can cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose Circuit-Targeted Supervised Fine-Tuning (CT-SFT): a counterfactual-free adaptation of CD-T (Contextual Decomposition Transformer) that uses a label-balanced mean baseline and task-directional relevance scoring to identify a sparse set of task-relevant attention heads in a proxy-language checkpoint, then transfer learns to a target language by updating only those heads (plus LayerNorm) via head-level gradient masking. Across NusaX-Senti and XNLI, CT-SFT improves cross-lingual accuracy over continued full fine-tuning while updating only a small subset of model parameters. We find an editing-preserving trade-off: harder transfers favor editing circuit heads, while easier transfers often favor near-zero (i.e., low-relevance heads) updates, preserving the source mechanism. CT-SFT also substantially reduces catastrophic forgetting, preserving proxy/source-language competence during transfer.</description>

      <title>Enriching Semantic Profiles into Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rich and informative profiling to capture user preferences is essential for improving recommendation quality. However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Structure Learning via Resistance Curvature Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric Representation Learning (GRL) aims to approximate the non-Euclidean topology of high-dimensional data through discrete graph structures, grounded in the manifold hypothesis. However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models. We design a graph optimization algorithm, DGSL-RCF, based on this framework. Experimental results across deep metric learning, manifold learning, and graph structure learning demonstrate that DGSL-RCF significantly improves representation quality and downstream task performance.</description>

      <title>SwiftMem: Fast Agentic Memory via Query-aware Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic memory systems have become critical for enabling LLM agents to maintain long-term context and retrieve relevant information efficiently. However, existing memory frameworks suffer from a fundamental limitation: they perform exhaustive retrieval across the entire storage layer regardless of query characteristics. This brute-force approach creates severe latency bottlenecks as memory grows, hindering real-time agent interactions. We propose SwiftMem, a query-aware agentic memory system that achieves sub-linear retrieval through specialized indexing over temporal and semantic dimensions. Our temporal index enables logarithmic-time range queries for time-sensitive retrieval, while the semantic DAG-Tag index maps queries to relevant topics through hierarchical tag structures. To address memory fragmentation during growth, we introduce an embedding-tag co-consolidation mechanism that reorganizes storage based on semantic clusters to improve cache locality. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftMem achieves 47$\times$ faster search compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment of memory-augmented LLM agents.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Based Clarity Evaluation and Topic Detection in Political Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic evaluation of large language model (LLM) responses requires not only factual correctness but also clarity, particularly in political question-answering. While recent datasets provide human annotations for clarity and evasion, the impact of prompt design on automatic clarity evaluation remains underexplored. In this paper, we study prompt-based clarity evaluation using the CLARITY dataset from the SemEval 2026 shared task. We compare a GPT-3.5 baseline provided with the dataset against GPT-5.2 evaluated under three prompting strategies: simple prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought with few-shot examples. Model predictions are evaluated against human annotations using accuracy and class-wise metrics for clarity and evasion, along with hierarchical exact match. Results show that GPT-5.2 consistently outperforms the GPT-3.5 baseline on clarity prediction, with accuracy improving from 56 percent to 63 percent under chain-of-thought with few-shot prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting yields the highest evasion accuracy at 34 percent, though improvements are less stable across fine-grained evasion categories. We further evaluate topic identification and find that reasoning-based prompting improves accuracy from 60 percent to 74 percent relative to human annotations. Overall, our findings indicate that prompt design reliably improves high-level clarity evaluation, while fine-grained evasion and topic detection remain challenging despite structured reasoning prompts.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Driven 3D Facial Expression Generation and Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/</description>

      <title>GI-Bench: A Panoramic Benchmark Revealing the Knowledge-Experience Dissociation of Multimodal Large Language Models in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Against Clinical Standards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise in gastroenterology, yet their performance against comprehensive clinical workflows and human benchmarks remains unverified. To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p&gt;0.05). However, a critical "spatial grounding bottleneck" persisted; human lesion localization (mIoU &gt;0.506) significantly outperformed the best model (0.345; p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed a "fluency-accuracy paradox": models generated reports with superior linguistic readability compared with humans (p&lt;0.05) but exhibited significantly lower factual correctness (p&lt;0.05) due to "over-interpretation" and hallucination of visual features.GI-Bench maintains a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the evolving performance of MLLMs in clinical endoscopy. The current rankings and benchmark results are available at https://roterdl.github.io/GIBench/.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Materials Exploration by Integrating Automated Phase Identification and AI-Assisted Human Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous experimentation holds the potential to accelerate materials development by combining artificial intelligence (AI) with modular robotic platforms to explore extensive combinatorial chemical and processing spaces. Such self-driving laboratories can not only increase the throughput of repetitive experiments, but also incorporate human domain expertise to drive the search towards user-defined objectives, including improved materials performance metrics. We present an autonomous materials synthesis extension to SARA, the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent, utilizing phase information provided by an automated probabilistic phase labeling algorithm to expedite the search for targeted phase regions. By incorporating human input into an expanded SARA-H (SARA with human-in-the-loop) framework, we enhance the efficiency of the underlying reasoning process. Using synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate the efficiency of our AI implementation and show that the human input can contribute to significant improvement in sampling efficiency. We conduct experimental active learning campaigns using robotic processing of thin-film samples of several oxide material systems, including Bi$_2$O$_3$, SnO$_x$, and Bi-Ti-O, using lateral-gradient laser spike annealing to synthesize and kinetically trap metastable phases. We showcase the utility of human-in-the-loop autonomous experimentation for the Bi-Ti-O system, where we identify extensive processing domains that stabilize $\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ and Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, explore dwell-dependent ternary oxide phase behavior, and provide evidence confirming predictions that cationic substitutional doping of TiO$_2$ with Bi inhibits the unfavorable transformation of the metastable anatase to the ground-state rutile phase. The autonomous methods we have developed enable the discovery of new materials and new understanding of materials synthesis and properties.</description>

      <title>ForgetMark: Stealthy Fingerprint Embedding via Targeted Unlearning in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Implicit Regulatory Compliance in LLM Tool Invocation via Logic-Guided Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has enabled complex tool use, yet in high-stakes domains, these systems must strictly adhere to regulatory standards beyond simple functional correctness. However, existing benchmarks often overlook implicit regulatory compliance, thus failing to evaluate whether LLMs can autonomously enforce mandatory safety constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce LogiSafetyGen, a framework that converts unstructured regulations into Linear Temporal Logic oracles and employs logic-guided fuzzing to synthesize valid, safety-critical traces. Building on this framework, we construct LogiSafetyBench, a benchmark comprising 240 human-verified tasks that require LLMs to generate Python programs that satisfy both functional objectives and latent compliance rules. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveal that larger models, despite achieving better functional correctness, frequently prioritize task completion over safety, which results in non-compliant behavior.</description>

      <title>DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</description>

Abstract: This research analyzed and compared the multi-modal approach in the Vision Transformer(EVA-ViT) based image encoder with the LlaMA or ChatGPT LLM to reduce the hallucination problem and detect diseases in chest x-ray images. In this research, we utilized the NIH Chest X-ray image to train the model and compared it in image-based RAG, text-based RAG, and baseline. [3] [5] In a result, the text-based RAG[2] e!ectively reduces the hallucination problem by using external knowledge information, and the image-based RAG improved the prediction con"dence and calibration by using the KNN methods. [4] Moreover, the GPT LLM showed better performance, a low hallucination rate, and better Expected Calibration Error(ECE) than Llama Llama-based model. This research shows the challenge of data imbalance, a complex multi-stage structure, but suggests a large experience environment and a balanced example of use.</description>

      <title>GADPN: Graph Adaptive Denoising and Perturbation Networks via Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel on graph-structured data, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the observed graph, which often contains noise, missing links, or structural properties misaligned with GNNs' underlying assumptions. To address this, graph structure learning aims to infer a more optimal topology. Existing methods, however, often incur high computational costs due to complex generative models and iterative joint optimization, limiting their practical utility. In this paper, we propose GADPN, a simple yet effective graph structure learning framework that adaptively refines graph topology via low-rank denoising and generalized structural perturbation. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) we introduce Bayesian optimization to adaptively determine the optimal denoising strength, tailoring the process to each graph's homophily level; and (2) we extend the structural perturbation method to arbitrary graphs via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), overcoming its original limitation to symmetric structures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GADPN achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly improving efficiency. It shows particularly strong gains on challenging disassortative graphs, validating its ability to robustly learn enhanced graph structures across diverse network types.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In heterogeneous graphs, we can observe complex structures such as tree-like or hierarchical structures. Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of HypHGT, and the results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification task, with significantly reduced training time and memory usage.</description>

      <title>On Evaluation of Unsupervised Feature Selection for Pattern Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection aims to identify a compact subset of features that captures the intrinsic structure of data without supervised label. Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods.</description>

      <title>HIPPO: Accelerating Video Large Language Models Inference via Holistic-aware Parallel Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate LLM inference without sacrificing output quality. Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases. Experiments on four video-LLMs across six benchmarks demonstrate HIPPO's effectiveness, yielding up to 3.51x speedup compared to vanilla auto-regressive decoding.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the Slash Pattern in Attention: The Role of RoPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit slash attention patterns, where attention scores concentrate along the $\Delta$-th sub-diagonal for some offset $\Delta$. These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sentiment Classification and Irony Detection in Large Language Models through Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of prompt engineering to enhance large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini and gemini-1.5-flash, in sentiment analysis tasks. It evaluates advanced prompting techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-consistency against a baseline. Key tasks include sentiment classification, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and detecting subtle nuances such as irony. The research details the theoretical background, datasets, and methods used, assessing performance of LLMs as measured by accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Findings reveal that advanced prompting significantly improves sentiment analysis, with the few-shot approach excelling in GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought prompting boosting irony detection in gemini-1.5-flash by up to 46%. Thus, while advanced prompting techniques overall improve performance, the fact that few-shot prompting works best for GPT-4o-mini and chain-of-thought excels in gemini-1.5-flash for irony detection suggests that prompting strategies must be tailored to both the model and the task. This highlights the importance of aligning prompt design with both the LLM's architecture and the semantic complexity of the task.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: On-policy Exploration-Exploitation for Controllable Multi-Budget Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by leveraging long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but uniformly applying overlong reasoning at inference time incurs substantial and often unnecessary computational cost. To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Image Quality Assessment Ability of LMMs via Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently shown remarkable promise in low-level visual perception tasks, particularly in Image Quality Assessment (IQA), demonstrating strong zero-shot capability. However, achieving state-of-the-art performance often requires computationally expensive fine-tuning methods, which aim to align the distribution of quality-related token in output with image quality levels. Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration &amp; Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Safe Heterogeneous Multi-Agent RL with Communication Regularization for Coordinated Target Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework enabling structurally heterogeneous teams of agents to jointly discover and acquire randomly located targets in environments characterized by partial observability, communication constraints, and dynamic interactions. Each agent's policy is trained with the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm and employs a Graph Attention Network encoder that integrates simulated range-sensing data with communication embeddings exchanged among neighboring agents, enabling context-aware decision-making from both local sensing and relational information. In particular, this work introduces a unified framework that integrates graph-based communication and trajectory-aware safety through safety filters. The architecture is supported by a structured reward formulation designed to encourage effective target discovery and acquisition, collision avoidance, and de-correlation between the agents' communication vectors by promoting informational orthogonality. The effectiveness of the proposed reward function is demonstrated through a comprehensive ablation study. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate safe and stable task execution, confirming the framework's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>IGAN: A New Inception-based Model for Stable and High-Fidelity Image Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) face a significant challenge of striking an optimal balance between high-quality image generation and training stability. Recent techniques, such as DCGAN, BigGAN, and StyleGAN, improve visual fidelity; however, such techniques usually struggle with mode collapse and unstable gradients at high network depth. This paper proposes a novel GAN structural model that incorporates deeper inception-inspired convolution and dilated convolution. This novel model is termed the Inception Generative Adversarial Network (IGAN). The IGAN model generates high-quality synthetic images while maintaining training stability, by reducing mode collapse as well as preventing vanishing and exploding gradients. Our proposed IGAN model achieves the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.12 and 15.08 on the CUB-200 and ImageNet datasets, respectively, representing a 28-33% improvement in FID over the state-of-the-art GANs. Additionally, the IGAN model attains an Inception Score (IS) of 9.27 and 68.25, reflecting improved image diversity and generation quality. Finally, the two techniques of dropout and spectral normalization are utilized in both the generator and discriminator structures to further mitigate gradient explosion and overfitting. These findings confirm that the IGAN model potentially balances training stability with image generation quality, constituting a scalable and computationally efficient framework for high-fidelity image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Scalable Sequential Recommendation under Latency and Memory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential recommender systems must model long-range user behavior while operating under strict memory and latency constraints. Transformer-based approaches achieve strong accuracy but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, forcing aggressive truncation of user histories and limiting their practicality for long-horizon modeling. This paper presents HoloMambaRec, a lightweight sequential recommendation architecture that combines holographic reduced representations for attribute-aware embedding with a selective state space encoder for linear-time sequence processing. Item and attribute information are bound using circular convolution, preserving embedding dimensionality while encoding structured metadata. A shallow selective state space backbone, inspired by recent Mamba-style models, enables efficient training and constant-time recurrent inference. Experiments on Amazon Beauty and MovieLens-1M datasets demonstrate that HoloMambaRec consistently outperforms SASRec and achieves competitive performance with GRU4Rec under a constrained 10-epoch training budget, while maintaining substantially lower memory complexity. The design further incorporates forward-compatible mechanisms for temporal bundling and inference-time compression, positioning HoloMambaRec as a practical and extensible alternative for scalable, metadata-aware sequential recommendation.</description>

      <title>Geo-NVS-w: Geometry-Aware Novel View Synthesis In-the-Wild with an SDF Renderer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Geo-NVS-w, a geometry-aware framework for high-fidelity novel view synthesis from unstructured, in-the-wild image collections. While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Distribution Adaptation for Diffusion Models via Maximum Mean Discrepancy Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for both unconditional and conditional sample generation, yet their outputs often deviate from the characteristics of user-specific target data. Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.</description>

      <title>Controlled LLM Training on Spectral Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling large models requires optimization strategies that ensure rapid convergence grounded in stability. Maximal Update Parametrization ($\boldsymbol{\mu}$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $\Theta(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\boldsymbol{\mu}$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Two Stage Deep Learning Framework for Pericoronitis Assessment in Panoramic Radiographs Using YOLOv8 and ResNet-50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: To overcome challenges in diagnosing pericoronitis on panoramic radiographs, an AI-assisted assessment system integrating anatomical localization, pathological classification, and interpretability. Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented. The first stage used YOLOv8 to detect third molars and classify their anatomical positions and angulations based on Winter's classification. Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis. Radiologists reported 84% alignment between Grad-CAM and their diagnostic impressions, supporting the radiographic relevance of the interpretability output. Conclusion: The system shows strong potential for AI-assisted panoramic assessment, with explainable AI features that support clinical confidence.</description>

      <title>PATS: Personality-Aware Teaching Strategies with Large Language Model Tutors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their potential as educational tutors. However, different tutoring strategies benefit different student personalities, and mismatches can be counterproductive to student outcomes. Despite this, current LLM tutoring systems do not take into account student personality traits. To address this problem, we first construct a taxonomy that links pedagogical methods to personality profiles, based on pedagogical literature. We simulate student-teacher conversations and use our framework to let the LLM tutor adjust its strategy to the simulated student personality. We evaluate the scenario with human teachers and find that they consistently prefer our approach over two baselines. Our method also increases the use of less common, high-impact strategies such as role-playing, which human and LLM annotators prefer significantly. Our findings pave the way for developing more personalized and effective LLM use in educational applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic research pipelines; however, the Terms of Service governing their use remain under-examined. We present a comparative analysis of the Terms of Service of five major LLM providers (Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI, and xAI) collected in November 2025. Our analysis reveals substantial variation in the stringency and specificity of usage restrictions for general users and researchers. We identify specific complexities for researchers in security research, computational social sciences, and psychological studies. We identify `regulatory gray areas' where Terms of Service create uncertainty for legitimate use. We contribute a publicly available resource comparing terms across platforms (OSF) and discuss implications for general users and researchers navigating this evolving landscape.</description>

      <title>Taxon: Hierarchical Tax Code Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLM Expert Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Large Multimodal Models for Embodied Intelligent Driving: The Next Frontier in Self-Driving?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We starts by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Divide and Conquer: Static-Dynamic Collaboration for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continuously recognize novel classes under limited data, which suffers from the key stability-plasticity dilemma: balancing the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new knowledge. To address this issue, we divide the task into two different stages and propose a framework termed Static-Dynamic Collaboration (SDC) to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity. Specifically, our method divides the normal pipeline of FSCIL into Static Retaining Stage (SRS) and Dynamic Learning Stage (DLS), which harnesses old static and incremental dynamic class information, respectively. During SRS, we train an initial model with sufficient data in the base session and preserve the key part as static memory to retain fundamental old knowledge. During DLS, we introduce an extra dynamic projector jointly trained with the previous static memory. By employing both stages, our method achieves improved retention of old knowledge while continuously adapting to new classes. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a real-world application dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance against other competitors.</description>

      <title>Decoding Order Matters in Autoregressive Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive speech synthesis often adopts a left-to-right order, yet generation order is a modelling choice. We investigate decoding order through masked diffusion framework, which progressively unmasks positions and allows arbitrary decoding orders during training and inference. By interpolating between identity and random permutations, we show that randomness in decoding order affects speech quality. We further compare fixed strategies, such as \texttt{l2r} and \texttt{r2l} with adaptive ones, such as Top-$K$, finding that fixed-order decoding, including the dominating left-to-right approach, is suboptimal, while adaptive decoding yields better performance. Finally, since masked diffusion requires discrete inputs, we quantise acoustic representations and find that even 1-bit quantisation can support reasonably high-quality speech.</description>

      <title>A Formal Proof of a Continued Fraction Conjecture for $\pi$ Originating from the Ramanujan Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formal analytic proof for a class of non-canonical polynomial continued fractions representing {\pi}/4, originally conjectured by the Ramanujan Machine using algorithmic induction [4]. By establishing an explicit correspondence with the ratio of contiguous Gaussian hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b; c; z), we show that these identities can be derived via a discrete sequence of equivalence transformations. We further prove that the conjectured integer coefficients constitute a symbolically minimal realization of the underlying analytic kernel. Stability analysis confirms that the resulting limit-periodic structures reside strictly within the Worpitzky convergence disk, ensuring absolute convergence. This work demonstrates that such algorithmically discovered identities are not isolated numerical artifacts, but are deeply rooted in the classical theory of hypergeometric transformations.</description>

      <title>CoMa: Contextual Massing Generation with Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conceptual design phase in architecture and urban planning, particularly building massing, is complex and heavily reliant on designer intuition and manual effort. To address this, we propose an automated framework for generating building massing based on functional requirements and site context. A primary obstacle to such data-driven methods has been the lack of suitable datasets. Consequently, we introduce the CoMa-20K dataset, a comprehensive collection that includes detailed massing geometries, associated economical and programmatic data, and visual representations of the development site within its existing urban context. We benchmark this dataset by formulating massing generation as a conditional task for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating both fine-tuned and large zero-shot models. Our experiments reveal the inherent complexity of the task while demonstrating the potential of VLMs to produce context-sensitive massing options. The dataset and analysis establish a foundational benchmark and highlight significant opportunities for future research in data-driven architectural design.</description>

      <title>JudgeRLVR: Judge First, Generate Second for Efficient Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a standard paradigm for reasoning in Large Language Models. However, optimizing solely for final-answer correctness often drives models into aimless, verbose exploration, where they rely on exhaustive trial-and-error tactics rather than structured planning to reach solutions. While heuristic constraints like length penalties can reduce verbosity, they often truncate essential reasoning steps, creating a difficult trade-off between efficiency and verification. In this paper, we argue that discriminative capability is a prerequisite for efficient generation: by learning to distinguish valid solutions, a model can internalize a guidance signal that prunes the search space. We propose JudgeRLVR, a two-stage judge-then-generate paradigm. In the first stage, we train the model to judge solution responses with verifiable answers. In the second stage, we fine-tune the same model with vanilla generating RLVR initialized from the judge. Compared to Vanilla RLVR using the same math-domain training data, JudgeRLVR achieves a better quality--efficiency trade-off for Qwen3-30B-A3B: on in-domain math, it delivers about +3.7 points average accuracy gain with -42\% average generation length; on out-of-domain benchmarks, it delivers about +4.5 points average accuracy improvement, demonstrating enhanced generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models frequently generate plausible but unfaithful summaries that users cannot verify against source text, a critical limitation in compliance-sensitive domains such as government and legal analysis. We present sui-1, a 24B parameter model that produces abstractive summaries with inline citations, enabling users to trace each claim to its source sentence. Our synthetic data pipeline combines chain-of-thought prompting with multi-stage verification, generating over 22,000 high-quality training examples across five languages from diverse sources including parliamentary documents, web text, and Wikipedia. Evaluation shows sui-1 significantly outperforms all tested open-weight baselines, including models with 3x more parameters. These results demonstrate that task-specific training substantially outperforms scale alone for citation-grounded summarization. Model weights and an interactive demo are publicly available.</description>

      <title>BenchOverflow: Measuring Overflow in Large Language Models via Plain-Text Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a failure mode of large language models (LLMs) in which plain-text prompts elicit excessive outputs, a phenomenon we term Overflow. Unlike jailbreaks or prompt injection, Overflow arises under ordinary interaction settings and can lead to elevated serving cost, latency, and cross-user performance degradation, particularly when scaled across many requests. Beyond usability, the stakes are economic and environmental: unnecessary tokens increase per-request cost and energy consumption, compounding into substantial operational spend and carbon footprint at scale. Moreover, Overflow represents a practical vector for compute amplification and service degradation in shared environments. We introduce BenchOverflow, a model-agnostic benchmark of nine plain-text prompting strategies that amplify output volume without adversarial suffixes or policy circumvention. Using a standardized protocol with a fixed budget of 5000 new tokens, we evaluate nine open- and closed-source models and observe pronounced rightward shifts and heavy tails in length distributions. Cap-saturation rates (CSR@1k/3k/5k) and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) quantify tail risk; within-prompt variance and cross-model correlations show that Overflow is broadly reproducible yet heterogeneous across families and attack vectors. A lightweight mitigation-a fixed conciseness reminder-attenuates right tails and lowers CSR for all strategies across the majority of models. Our findings position length control as a measurable reliability, cost, and sustainability concern rather than a stylistic quirk. By enabling standardized comparison of length-control robustness across models, BenchOverflow provides a practical basis for selecting deployments that minimize resource waste and operating expense, and for evaluating defenses that curb compute amplification without eroding task performance.</description>

      <title>PKI: Prior Knowledge-Infused Neural Network for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to continually adapt a model on a limited number of new-class examples, facing two well-known challenges: catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to new classes. Existing methods tend to freeze more parts of network components and finetune others with an extra memory during incremental sessions. These methods emphasize preserving prior knowledge to ensure proficiency in recognizing old classes, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, constraining fewer parameters can help in overcoming overfitting with the assistance of prior knowledge. Following previous methods, we retain more prior knowledge and propose a prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKI) to facilitate FSCIL. PKI consists of a backbone, an ensemble of projectors, a classifier, and an extra memory. In each incremental session, we build a new projector and add it to the ensemble. Subsequently, we finetune the new projector and the classifier jointly with other frozen network components, ensuring the rich prior knowledge is utilized effectively. By cascading projectors, PKI integrates prior knowledge accumulated from previous sessions and learns new knowledge flexibly, which helps to recognize old classes and efficiently learn new classes. Further, to reduce the resource consumption associated with keeping many projectors, we design two variants of the prior knowledge-infused neural network (PKIV-1 and PKIV-2) to trade off a balance between resource consumption and performance by reducing the number of projectors. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>EfficientFSL: Enhancing Few-Shot Classification via Query-Only Tuning in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large models such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable superiority over smaller architectures like ResNet in few-shot classification, owing to their powerful representational capacity. However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner. We further propose a Combine Block to fuse multi-layer outputs, enhancing the depth and robustness of feature representations. Finally, a Support-Query Attention Block mitigates distribution shift by adjusting prototypes to align with the query set distribution. With minimal trainable parameters, EfficientFSL achieves state-of-the-art performance on four in-domain few-shot datasets and six cross-domain datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal Fusion Nexus: A task-agnostic multi-modal embedding model for clinical narratives and irregular time series in post-kidney transplant care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Temporal Fusion Nexus (TFN), a multi-modal and task-agnostic embedding model to integrate irregular time series and unstructured clinical narratives. We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data). Integrating clinical text improved performance across all tasks. Disentanglement metrics confirmed robust and interpretable latent factors in the embedding space, and SHAP-based attributions confirmed alignment with clinical reasoning. TFN has potential application in clinical tasks beyond KTx, where heterogeneous data sources, irregular longitudinal data, and rich narrative documentation are available.</description>

      <title>STAGE: A Benchmark for Knowledge Graph Construction, Question Answering, and In-Script Role-Playing over Movie Screenplays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movie screenplays are rich long-form narratives that interleave complex character relationships, temporally ordered events, and dialogue-driven interactions. While prior benchmarks target individual subtasks such as question answering or dialogue generation, they rarely evaluate whether models can construct a coherent story world and use it consistently across multiple forms of reasoning and generation. We introduce STAGE (Screenplay Text, Agents, Graphs and Evaluation), a unified benchmark for narrative understanding over full-length movie screenplays. STAGE defines four tasks: knowledge graph construction, scene-level event summarization, long-context screenplay question answering, and in-script character role-playing, all grounded in a shared narrative world representation. The benchmark provides cleaned scripts, curated knowledge graphs, and event- and character-centric annotations for 150 films across English and Chinese, enabling holistic evaluation of models' abilities to build world representations, abstract and verify narrative events, reason over long narratives, and generate character-consistent responses.</description>

      <title>CD^2: Constrained Dataset Distillation for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) receives significant attention from the public to perform classification continuously with a few training samples, which suffers from the key catastrophic forgetting problem. Existing methods usually employ an external memory to store previous knowledge and treat it with incremental classes equally, which cannot properly preserve previous essential knowledge. To solve this problem and inspired by recent distillation works on knowledge transfer, we propose a framework termed \textbf{C}onstrained \textbf{D}ataset \textbf{D}istillation (\textbf{CD$^2$}) to facilitate FSCIL, which includes a dataset distillation module (\textbf{DDM}) and a distillation constraint module~(\textbf{DCM}). Specifically, the DDM synthesizes highly condensed samples guided by the classifier, forcing the model to learn compacted essential class-related clues from a few incremental samples. The DCM introduces a designed loss to constrain the previously learned class distribution, which can preserve distilled knowledge more sufficiently. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show the superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>Contrastive and Multi-Task Learning on Noisy Brain Signals with Nonlinear Dynamical Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-stage multitask learning framework for analyzing Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that integrates denoising, dynamical modeling, and representation learning. In the first stage, a denoising autoencoder is trained to suppress artifacts and stabilize temporal dynamics, providing robust signal representations. In the second stage, a multitask architecture processes these denoised signals to achieve three objectives: motor imagery classification, chaotic versus non-chaotic regime discrimination using Lyapunov exponent-based labels, and self-supervised contrastive representation learning with NT-Xent loss. A convolutional backbone combined with a Transformer encoder captures spatial-temporal structure, while the dynamical task encourages sensitivity to nonlinear brain dynamics. This staged design mitigates interference between reconstruction and discriminative goals, improves stability across datasets, and supports reproducible training by clearly separating noise reduction from higher-level feature learning. Empirical studies show that our framework not only enhances robustness and generalization but also surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art methods in EEG decoding, highlighting the effectiveness of combining denoising, dynamical features, and self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>VideoHEDGE: Entropy-Based Hallucination Detection for Video-VLMs via Semantic Clustering and Spatiotemporal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations in video-capable vision-language models (Video-VLMs) remain frequent and high-confidence, while existing uncertainty metrics often fail to align with correctness. We introduce VideoHEDGE, a modular framework for hallucination detection in video question answering that extends entropy-based reliability estimation from images to temporally structured inputs. Given a video-question pair, VideoHEDGE draws a baseline answer and multiple high-temperature generations from both clean clips and photometrically and spatiotemporally perturbed variants, then clusters the resulting textual outputs into semantic hypotheses using either Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based or embedding-based methods. Cluster-level probability masses yield three reliability scores: Semantic Entropy (SE), RadFlag, and Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE). We evaluate VideoHEDGE on the SoccerChat benchmark using an LLM-as-a-judge to obtain binary hallucination labels. Across three 7B Video-VLMs (Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, and a SoccerChat-finetuned model), VASE consistently achieves the highest ROC-AUC, especially at larger distortion budgets, while SE and RadFlag often operate near chance. We further show that embedding-based clustering matches NLI-based clustering in detection performance at substantially lower computational cost, and that domain fine-tuning reduces hallucination frequency but yields only modest improvements in calibration. The hedge-bench PyPI library enables reproducible and extensible benchmarking, with full code and experimental resources available at https://github.com/Simula/HEDGE#videohedge .</description>

      <title>Rewriting Video: Text-Driven Reauthoring of Video Footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video is a powerful medium for communication and storytelling, yet reauthoring existing footage remains challenging. Even simple edits often demand expertise, time, and careful planning, constraining how creators envision and shape their narratives. Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm. Our work contributes empirical insights into the opportunities and challenges of text-driven video reauthoring, offering design implications for future co-creative video tools.</description>

      <title>WaveFormer: Frequency-Time Decoupled Vision Modeling with Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision modeling has advanced rapidly with Transformers, whose attention mechanisms capture visual dependencies but lack a principled account of how semantic information propagates spatially. We revisit this problem from a wave-based perspective: feature maps are treated as spatial signals whose evolution over an internal propagation time (aligned with network depth) is governed by an underdamped wave equation. In this formulation, spatial frequency-from low-frequency global layout to high-frequency edges and textures-is modeled explicitly, and its interaction with propagation time is controlled rather than implicitly fixed. We derive a closed-form, frequency-time decoupled solution and implement it as the Wave Propagation Operator (WPO), a lightweight module that models global interactions in O(N log N) time-far lower than attention. Building on WPO, we propose a family of WaveFormer models as drop-in replacements for standard ViTs and CNNs, achieving competitive accuracy across image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while delivering up to 1.6x higher throughput and 30% fewer FLOPs than attention-based alternatives. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that wave propagation introduces a complementary modeling bias to heat-based methods, effectively capturing both global coherence and high-frequency details essential for rich visual semantics.

      <title>ExpSeek: Self-Triggered Experience Seeking for Web Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experience intervention in web agents emerges as a promising technical paradigm, enhancing agent interaction capabilities by providing valuable insights from accumulated experiences. However, existing methods predominantly inject experience passively as global context before task execution, struggling to adapt to dynamically changing contextual observations during agent-environment interaction. We propose ExpSeek, which shifts experience toward step-level proactive seeking: (1) estimating step-level entropy thresholds to determine intervention timing using the model's intrinsic signals; (2) designing step-level tailor-designed experience content. Experiments on Qwen3-8B and 32B models across four challenging web agent benchmarks demonstrate that ExpSeek achieves absolute improvements of 9.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Our experiments validate the feasibility and advantages of entropy as a self-triggering signal, reveal that even a 4B small-scale experience model can significantly boost the performance of larger agent models.</description>

      <title>VeriTaS: The First Dynamic Benchmark for Multimodal Automated Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing scale of online misinformation urgently demands Automated Fact-Checking (AFC). Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>SafeRedir: Prompt Embedding Redirection for Robust Unlearning in Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image generation models (IGMs), while capable of producing impressive and creative content, often memorize a wide range of undesirable concepts from their training data, leading to the reproduction of unsafe content such as NSFW imagery and copyrighted artistic styles. Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ryliu68/SafeRedir.</description>

      <title>M$^2$FMoE: Multi-Resolution Multi-View Frequency Mixture-of-Experts for Extreme-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.</description>

      <title>Moral Lenses, Political Coordinates: Towards Ideological Positioning of Morally Conditioned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent research has systematically documented political orientation in large language models (LLMs), existing evaluations rely primarily on direct probing or demographic persona engineering to surface ideological biases. In social psychology, however, political ideology is also understood as a downstream consequence of fundamental moral intuitions. In this work, we investigate the causal relationship between moral values and political positioning by treating moral orientation as a controllable condition. Rather than simply assigning a demographic persona, we condition models to endorse or reject specific moral values and evaluate the resulting shifts on their political orientations, using the Political Compass Test. By treating moral values as lenses, we observe how moral conditioning actively steers model trajectories across economic and social dimensions. Our findings show that such conditioning induces pronounced, value-specific shifts in models' political coordinates. We further notice that these effects are systematically modulated by role framing and model scale, and are robust across alternative assessment instruments instantiating the same moral value. This highlights that effective alignment requires anchoring political assessments within the context of broader social values including morality, paving the way for more socially grounded alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>RULERS: Locked Rubrics and Evidence-Anchored Scoring for Robust LLM Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm promises scalable rubric-based evaluation, yet aligning frozen black-box models with human standards remains a challenge due to inherent generation stochasticity. We reframe judge alignment as a criteria transfer problem and isolate three recurrent failure modes: rubric instability caused by prompt sensitivity, unverifiable reasoning that lacks auditable evidence, and scale misalignment with human grading boundaries. To address these issues, we introduce RULERS (Rubric Unification, Locking, and Evidence-anchored Robust Scoring), a compiler-executor framework that transforms natural language rubrics into executable specifications. RULERS operates by compiling criteria into versioned immutable bundles, enforcing structured decoding with deterministic evidence verification, and applying lightweight Wasserstein-based post-hoc calibration, all without updating model parameters. Extensive experiments on essay and summarization benchmarks demonstrate that RULERS significantly outperforms representative baselines in human agreement, maintains strong stability against adversarial rubric perturbations, and enables smaller models to rival larger proprietary judges. Overall, our results suggest that reliable LLM judging requires executable rubrics, verifiable evidence, and calibrated scales rather than prompt phrasing alone.

      <description>arXiv:2601.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in high-dimensional, time-dependent simulation data is challenging due to complex spatial and temporal dynamics. We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized K\'arm\'an vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Lessons from the Field: An Adaptable Lifecycle Approach to Applied Dialogue Summarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Summarization of multi-party dialogues is a critical capability in industry, enhancing knowledge transfer and operational effectiveness across many domains. However, automatically generating high-quality summaries is challenging, as the ideal summary must satisfy a set of complex, multi-faceted requirements. While summarization has received immense attention in research, prior work has primarily utilized static datasets and benchmarks, a condition rare in practical scenarios where requirements inevitably evolve. In this work, we present an industry case study on developing an agentic system to summarize multi-party interactions. We share practical insights spanning the full development lifecycle to guide practitioners in building reliable, adaptable summarization systems, as well as to inform future research, covering: 1) robust methods for evaluation despite evolving requirements and task subjectivity, 2) component-wise optimization enabled by the task decomposition inherent in an agentic architecture, 3) the impact of upstream data bottlenecks, and 4) the realities of vendor lock-in due to the poor transferability of LLM prompts.</description>

      <title>Region of interest detection for efficient aortic segmentation</title>

Abstract: Thoracic aortic dissection and aneurysms are the most lethal diseases of the aorta. The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in higher education, it increasingly shapes how students complete academic tasks. While these systems offer efficiency and support, concerns persist regarding over-automation, diminished student agency, and the potential for unreliable or hallucinated outputs. This study conducts a mixed-methods audit of student-AI collaboration preferences by examining the alignment between current AI capabilities and students' desired levels of automation in academic work. Using two sequential and complementary surveys, we capture students' perceived benefits, risks, and preferred boundaries when using AI. The first survey employs an existing task-based framework to assess preferences for and actual usage of AI across 12 academic tasks, alongside primary concerns and reasons for use. The second survey, informed by the first, explores how AI systems could be designed to address these concerns through open-ended questions. This study aims to identify gaps between existing AI affordances and students' normative expectations of collaboration, informing the development of more effective and trustworthy AI systems for education.</description>

Abstract: Localization is a fundamental capability for autonomous robots, enabling them to operate effectively in dynamic environments. In Robocon 2025, accurate and reliable localization is crucial for improving shooting precision, avoiding collisions with other robots, and navigating the competition field efficiently. In this paper, we propose a hybrid localization algorithm that integrates classical techniques with learning based methods that rely solely on visual data from the court's floor to achieve self-localization on the basketball field.</description>

      <title>ISLA: A U-Net for MRI-based acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation with deep supervision, attention, domain adaptation, and ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate delineation of acute ischemic stroke lesions in MRI is a key component of stroke diagnosis and management. In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework. We further investigated unsupervised domain adaptation to improve generalization to an external clinical dataset. ISLA outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches for AIS lesion segmentation on an external test set. Codes and trained models will be made publicly available to facilitate reuse and reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is challenging, and large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect configurations from natural language (NL). We present TerraFormer, a neuro-symbolic framework for IaC generation and mutation that combines supervised fine-tuning with verifier-guided reinforcement learning, using formal verification tools to provide feedback on syntax, deployability, and policy compliance. We curate two large, high-quality NL-to-IaC datasets, TF-Gen (152k instances) and TF-Mutn (52k instances), via multi-stage verification and iterative LLM self-correction. Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test). It outperforms larger models on both TF-Gen (Test) and TF-Mutn (Test), ranks third on IaC-Eval, and achieves top best-practices and security compliance.</description>

      <title>TableCache: Primary Foreign Key Guided KV Cache Precomputation for Low Latency Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Text-to-SQL tasks, existing LLM-based methods often include extensive database schemas in prompts, leading to long context lengths and increased prefilling latency. While user queries typically focus on recurrent table sets-offering an opportunity for KV cache sharing across queries-current inference engines, such as SGLang and vLLM, generate redundant prefix cache copies when processing user queries with varying table orders. To address this inefficiency, we propose precomputing table representations as KV caches offline and querying the required ones online. A key aspect of our approach is the computation of table caches while preserving primary foreign key relationships between tables. Additionally, we construct a Table Trie structure to facilitate efficient KV cache lookups during inference. To enhance cache performance, we introduce a cache management system with a query reranking strategy to improve cache hit rates and a computation loading pipeline for parallelizing model inference and cache loading. Experimental results show that our proposed TableCache achieves up to a 3.62x speedup in Time to First Token (TTFT) with negligible performance degradation.</description>

      <title>To Retrieve or To Think? An Agentic Approach for Context Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current context augmentation methods, such as retrieval-augmented generation, are essential for solving knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks.However, they typically adhere to a rigid, brute-force strategy that executes retrieval at every step. This indiscriminate approach not only incurs unnecessary computational costs but also degrades performance by saturating the context with irrelevant noise. To address these limitations, we introduce Agentic Context Evolution (ACE), a framework inspired by human metacognition that dynamically determines whether to seek new evidence or reason with existing knowledge. ACE employs a central orchestrator agent to make decisions strategically via majority voting.It aims to alternate between activating a retriever agent for external retrieval and a reasoner agent for internal analysis and refinement. By eliminating redundant retrieval steps, ACE maintains a concise and evolved context. Extensive experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms competitive baselines in accuracy while achieving efficient token consumption.Our work provides valuable insights into advancing context-evolved generation for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.</description>

      <title>UR-Bench: A Benchmark for Multi-Hop Reasoning over Ultra-High-Resolution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong capabilities in visual-language reasoning, yet their performance on ultra-high-resolution imagery remains largely unexplored. Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Grid-Aware Charging and Operational Optimization for Mixed-Fleet Public Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.</description>

      <title>Reliable Graph-RAG for Codebases: AST-Derived Graphs vs LLM-Extracted Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for software engineering often relies on vector similarity search, which captures topical similarity but can fail on multi-hop architectural reasoning such as controller to service to repository chains, interface-driven wiring, and inheritance. This paper benchmarks three retrieval pipelines on Java codebases (Shopizer, with additional runs on ThingsBoard and OpenMRS Core): (A) vector-only No-Graph RAG, (B) an LLM-generated knowledge graph RAG (LLM-KB), and (C) a deterministic AST-derived knowledge graph RAG (DKB) built with Tree-sitter and bidirectional traversal.
  Using 15 architecture and code-tracing queries per repository, we measure indexing time, query latency, corpus coverage, cost, and answer correctness. DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases. Query latency is similar for No-Graph and DKB, while LLM-KB is slower and more variable. On the Shopizer question suite, DKB achieves the highest correctness, LLM-KB is close behind, and the vector-only baseline performs worst on upstream architectural queries and has the highest hallucination risk. Overall, deterministic AST-derived graphs provide more reliable coverage and multi-hop grounding than LLM-extracted graphs at substantially lower indexing cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Histopathology analysis relies on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, but fluorescence microscopy offers complementary information. Converting fluorescence images to H&amp;E-like appearance can aid interpretation and integration with standard workflows. We present a Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) approach for unpaired image-to-image translation from multi-channel fluorescence microscopy to pseudo H&amp;E stained histopathology images. The method combines C01 and C02 fluorescence channels into RGB and learns a bidirectional mapping between fluorescence and H&amp;E domains without paired training data. The architecture uses ResNet-based generators with residual blocks and PatchGAN discriminators, trained with adversarial, cycle-consistency, and identity losses. Experiments on fluorescence microscopy datasets show the model generates realistic pseudo H&amp;E images that preserve morphological structures while adopting H&amp;E-like color characteristics. This enables visualization of fluorescence data in a format familiar to pathologists and supports integration with existing H&amp;E-based analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Universal Alignment: A New Alignment Framework via Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\to 1$ as $k\to\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.
  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the AI Productivity Index for Software Engineering (APEX-SWE), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can execute economically valuable software engineering work. Unlike existing evaluations that focus on narrow, well-defined tasks, APEX-SWE assesses two novel task types that reflect real-world software engineering work: (1) Integration tasks (n=100), which require constructing end-to-end systems across heterogeneous cloud primitives, business applications, and infrastructure-as-code services, and (2) Observability tasks (n=100), which require debugging production failures using telemetry signals such as logs and dashboards, as well as unstructured context. We evaluated eight frontier models on APEX-SWE. Gemini 3 Pro (Thinking = High) performs best, with a Pass@1 score of 25\%. Our analysis shows that strong performance is primarily driven by epistemic reasoning, defined as the ability to distinguish between assumptions and verified facts, combined with agency to resolve uncertainty prior to acting. We open-source the APEX-SWE evaluation harness and a dev set (n=50).</description>

Abstract: Tracklet quality is often treated as an afterthought in most person re-identification (ReID) methods, with the majority of research presenting architectural modifications to foundational models. Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Thinking: Reasoning via Token-wise Branch-and-Merge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences. The code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/GMLR-Penn/Multiplex-Thinking.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Matters for 3D Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) with strong reasoning ability has driven research in various domains such as mathematics, coding, and scientific discovery. Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.</description>

      <title>MemRec: Collaborative Memory-Augmented Agentic Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

      <title>Motion Attribution for Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of video generation models, the role of data in influencing motion is poorly understood. We present Motive (MOTIon attribution for Video gEneration), a motion-centric, gradient-based data attribution framework that scales to modern, large, high-quality video datasets and models. We use this to study which fine-tuning clips improve or degrade temporal dynamics. Motive isolates temporal dynamics from static appearance via motion-weighted loss masks, yielding efficient and scalable motion-specific influence computation. On text-to-video models, Motive identifies clips that strongly affect motion and guides data curation that improves temporal consistency and physical plausibility. With Motive-selected high-influence data, our method improves both motion smoothness and dynamic degree on VBench, achieving a 74.1% human preference win rate compared with the pretrained base model. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to attribute motion rather than visual appearance in video generative models and to use it to curate fine-tuning data.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication: Diffusion Models Beyond Bit Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication is expected to be one of the cores of next-generation AI-based communications. One of the possibilities offered by semantic communication is the capability to regenerate, at the destination side, images or videos semantically equivalent to the transmitted ones, without necessarily recovering the transmitted sequence of bits. The current solutions still lack the ability to build complex scenes from the received partial information. Clearly, there is an unmet need to balance the effectiveness of generation methods and the complexity of the transmitted information, possibly taking into account the goal of communication. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel generative diffusion-guided framework for semantic communication that leverages the strong abilities of diffusion models in synthesizing multimedia content while preserving semantic features. We reduce bandwidth usage by sending highly-compressed semantic information only. Then, the diffusion model learns to synthesize semantic-consistent scenes through spatially-adaptive normalizations from such denoised semantic information. We prove, through an in-depth assessment of multiple scenarios, that our method outperforms existing solutions in generating high-quality images with preserved semantic information even in cases where the received content is significantly degraded. More specifically, our results show that objects, locations, and depths are still recognizable even in the presence of extremely noisy conditions of the communication channel.

      <title>Explaning with trees: interpreting CNNs using hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Challenges persist in providing interpretable explanations for neural network reasoning in explainable AI (xAI). Existing methods like Integrated Gradients produce noisy maps, and LIME, while intuitive, may deviate from the model's reasoning. We introduce a framework that uses hierarchical segmentation techniques for faithful and interpretable explanations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our method constructs model-based hierarchical segmentations that maintain the model's reasoning fidelity and allows both human-centric and model-centric segmentation. This approach offers multiscale explanations, aiding bias identification and enhancing understanding of neural network decision-making. Experiments show that our framework, xAiTrees, delivers highly interpretable and faithful model explanations, not only surpassing traditional xAI methods but shedding new light on a novel approach to enhancing xAI interpretability.</description>

      <title>COSINT-Agent: A Knowledge-Driven Multimodal Agent for Chinese Open Source Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) requires the integration and reasoning of diverse multimodal data, presenting significant challenges in deriving actionable insights. Traditional approaches, including multimodal large language models (MLLMs), often struggle to infer complex contextual relationships or deliver comprehensive intelligence from unstructured data sources. In this paper, we introduce COSINT-Agent, a knowledge-driven multimodal agent tailored to address the challenges of OSINT in the Chinese domain. COSINT-Agent seamlessly integrates the perceptual capabilities of fine-tuned MLLMs with the structured reasoning power of the Entity-Event-Scene Knowledge Graph (EES-KG). Central to COSINT-Agent is the innovative EES-Match framework, which bridges COSINT-MLLM and EES-KG, enabling systematic extraction, reasoning, and contextualization of multimodal insights. This integration facilitates precise entity recognition, event interpretation, and context retrieval, effectively transforming raw multimodal data into actionable intelligence. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of COSINT-Agent across core OSINT tasks, including entity recognition, EES generation, and context matching. These results underscore its potential as a robust and scalable solution for advancing automated multimodal reasoning and enhancing the effectiveness of OSINT methodologies.</description>

      <title>GTR-CoT: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought for Molecular Structure Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is essential for converting molecular images into machine-readable formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To address these issues, we introduce GTR-VL, featuring two key innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought} mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen} principle, which aligns abbreviated structures in images with their expanded annotations. For hand-drawn OCSR tasks, where datasets lack graph annotations and only provide final SMILES, we apply reinforcement learning using the GRPO method, introducing reward mechanisms like format reward, graph reward, and SMILES reward. This approach significantly enhances performance in hand-drawn recognition tasks through weak supervision. We developed GTR-1.3M, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with corrected annotations, and MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Our two-stage training scheme involves SFT training for printed images and the GRPO method for transferring capabilities to hand-drawn tasks. Experiments show that GTR-VL outperforms specialist models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial VLMs on both printed and hand-drawn datasets.</description>

      <title>VGC-Bench: Towards Mastering Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pok\'emon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to varying strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge in multi-agent learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with a vast space of approximately $10^{139}$ team configurations, far larger than those of other games such as Chess, Go, Poker, StarCraft, or Dota. The combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal strategies to vary substantially depending on both the controlled team and the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies a human-play dataset of over 700,000 battle logs and a range of baseline agents based on heuristics, large language models, behavior cloning, and multi-agent reinforcement learning with empirical game-theoretic methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated in a mirror match with a single team configuration, our methods can win against a professional VGC competitor. We repeat this training and evaluation with progressively larger team sets and find that as the number of teams increases, the best-performing algorithm in the single-team setting has worse performance and is more exploitable, but has improved generalization to unseen teams. Our code and dataset are open-sourced at https://github.com/cameronangliss/vgc-bench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/cameronangliss/vgc-battle-logs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the hypothesis that knowledge in semantic space is organized along structured manifolds, we argue that this geometric structure renders the space explorable. By traversing it and using the resulting continuous representations to condition an LLM's generation distribution, we can systematically expand the model's reachable semantic range. We introduce a framework that requires no modification of LLM parameters and operationalizes this idea by constructing a conditioning distribution from a small set of diverse anchor generations. This distribution conditions LLM's generation via an xRAG-style projector. Our experiments demonstrate that this manifold-based conditioning substantially increases generative diversity, with direct benefits for enhancing divergent thinking, a core facet of creativity, in language models.</description>

      <title>MoHoBench: Assessing Honesty of Multimodal Large Language Models via Unanswerable Visual Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly, especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs. Our data and code can be found at https://github.com/yanxuzhu/MoHoBench.</description>

      <title>MixGRPO: Unlocking Flow-based GRPO Efficiency with Mixed ODE-SDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO and DanceGRPO still exhibit inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose $\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence. Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for faster sampling. So we present a faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment, outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50% lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by 71%.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Fedspeak with Confidence: A LLM-Based Uncertainty-Aware Framework Guided by Monetary Policy Transmission Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: "Fedspeak", the stylized and often nuanced language used by the U.S. Federal Reserve, encodes implicit policy signals and strategic stances. The Federal Open Market Committee strategically employs Fedspeak as a communication tool to shape market expectations and influence both domestic and global economic conditions. As such, automatically parsing and interpreting Fedspeak presents a high-impact challenge, with significant implications for financial forecasting, algorithmic trading, and data-driven policy analysis. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based, uncertainty-aware framework for deciphering Fedspeak and classifying its underlying monetary policy stance. Technically, to enrich the semantic and contextual representation of Fedspeak texts, we incorporate domain-specific reasoning grounded in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We further introduce a dynamic uncertainty decoding module to assess the confidence of model predictions, thereby enhancing both classification accuracy and model reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the policy stance analysis task. Moreover, statistical analysis reveals a significant positive correlation between perceptual uncertainty and model error rates, validating the effectiveness of perceptual uncertainty as a diagnostic signal.</description>

      <title>DeKeyNLU: Enhancing Natural Language to SQL Generation through Task Decomposition and Keyword Extraction</title>

Abstract: Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) provides a new model-centric paradigm that simplifies database access for non-technical users by converting natural language queries into SQL commands. Recent advancements, particularly those integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, have made significant strides in enhancing NL2SQL performance. However, challenges such as inaccurate task decomposition and keyword extraction by LLMs remain major bottlenecks, often leading to errors in SQL generation. While existing datasets aim to mitigate these issues by fine-tuning models, they struggle with over-fragmentation of tasks and lack of domain-specific keyword annotations, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present DeKeyNLU, a novel dataset which contains 1,500 meticulously annotated QA pairs aimed at refining task decomposition and enhancing keyword extraction precision for the RAG pipeline. Fine-tuned with DeKeyNLU, we propose DeKeySQL, a RAG-based NL2SQL pipeline that employs three distinct modules for user question understanding, entity retrieval, and generation to improve SQL generation accuracy. We benchmarked multiple model configurations within DeKeySQL RAG pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning with DeKeyNLU significantly improves SQL generation accuracy on both BIRD (62.31% to 69.10%) and Spider (84.2% to 88.7%) dev datasets.</description>

Abstract: Learning formulas in Linear Temporal Logic (LTLf) from finite traces is a fundamental research problem which has found applications in artificial intelligence, software engineering, programming languages, formal methods, control of cyber-physical systems, and robotics. We implement a new CPU tool called Bolt improving over the state of the art by learning formulas more than 100x faster over 70% of the benchmarks, with smaller or equal formulas in 98% of the cases. Our key insight is to leverage a problem called Boolean Set Cover as a subroutine to combine existing formulas using Boolean connectives. Thanks to the Boolean Set Cover component, our approach offers a novel trade-off between efficiency and formula size.</description>

      <title>Structured Debate Improves Corporate Credit Reasoning in Financial AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigated LLM-based automation for analyzing non-financial data in corporate credit evaluation. Two systems were developed and compared: a Single-Agent System (SAS), in which one LLM agent infers favorable and adverse repayment signals, and a Popperian Multi-agent Debate System (PMADS), which structures the dual-perspective analysis as adversarial argumentation under the Karl Popper Debate protocol. Evaluation addressed three fronts: (i) work productivity compared with human experts; (ii) perceived report quality and usability, rated by credit risk professionals for system-generated reports; and (iii) reasoning characteristics quantified via reasoning-tree analysis. Both systems drastically reduced task completion time relative to human experts. Professionals rated SAS reports as adequate, while PMADS reports exceeded neutral benchmarks and scored significantly higher in explanatory adequacy, practical applicability, and usability. Reasoning-tree analysis showed PMADS produced deeper, more elaborated structures, whereas SAS yielded single-layered trees. These findings suggest that structured multi-agent debate enhances analytical rigor and perceived usefulness, though at the cost of longer computation time. Overall, the results demonstrate that reasoning-centered automation represents a promising approach for developing useful AI systems in decision-critical financial contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning "Partner-Aware" Collaborators in Multi-Party Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in agentic settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI alignment and safe interruptibility literature to offer novel theoretical insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator that increases the group's common-ground (CG) alignment on task-relevant propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions by a partner agent. We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.</description>

      <title>ToolRM: Towards Agentic Tool-Use Reward Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight reward models tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models, we propose a novel pipeline that constructs high-quality pairwise preference data using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging preference dataset that supports both generative and discriminative reward modeling. We also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on the agent evaluation suite BFCL to evaluate RMs on tool calling tasks. Trained on our constructed data, models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 17.94% higher accuracy, substantially outperforming frontier LLMs and RMs in pairwise reward judgments. Beyond training objectives, generative ToolRM generalizes to broader critique tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time scaling while reducing output token usage by over 66%. Its support for downstream RL training further validates its practical utility. We release data to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.</description>

      <title>Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08066v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further intensifies the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across diverse model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. A distinctive feature of information capacity is its incorporation of tokenizer efficiency, which affects inference costs but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 open-source models and observe a consistent information capacity among different-sized models within a series. Experiments on 5 heterogeneous datasets reveal strong linguistic bias in mainstream LLMs. Three major factors of information capacity include tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture. Empirical results verify the accuracy of performance prediction across model sizes based on information capacity and show the correlation between information capacity and benchmark scores.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Visual World with Artificial Intelligence: A Roadmap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of video generation is shifting, from a focus on generating visually appealing clips to building virtual environments that support interaction and maintain physical plausibility. These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a "window" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems. An up-to-date list of related works is maintained at this link.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Off-Policy Training Data on Probe Generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing has emerged as a promising method for monitoring large language models (LLMs), enabling cheap inference-time detection of concerning behaviours. However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that training data generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude varies greatly by behaviour. The largest generalisation failures arise for behaviours defined by response "intent" (e.g. strategic deception) rather than text-level content (e.g. usage of lists). We then propose a useful test for predicting generalisation failures in cases where on-policy test data is unavailable: successful generalisation to incentivised data (where the model was coerced) strongly correlates with high performance against on-policy examples. Based on these results, we predict that current deception probes may fail to generalise to real monitoring scenarios. Additionally, our finding that off-policy data can yield more reliable probes than on-policy data from a sufficiently different setting underscores the need for new monitoring methods that better handle all types of distribution shift.</description>

      <title>ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</description>

      <title>Sequential Enumeration in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably counting and generating sequences of items remain a significant challenge for neural networks, including Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization.</description>

      <title>LocalSearchBench: Benchmarking Agentic Search in Real-World Local Life Services</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models LRMs have enabled agentic search systems to perform complex multi-step reasoning across multiple sources. However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench comprises a database of over 1.3M merchant entries across 6 service categories and 9 major cities, and 900 multi-hop QA tasks from real user queries that require multi-step reasoning. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for LRMs interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.2) achieves only 35.60% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 60.32%) and faithfulness (average 30.72%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services.

      <title>TROJail: Trajectory-Level Optimization for Multi-Turn Large Language Model Jailbreaks with Process Rewards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have seen widespread adoption, yet they remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment. This has led to the task of training automated multi-turn attackers to probe model safety vulnerabilities. However, existing approaches typically rely on turn-level optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate this task as a multi-turn reinforcement learning problem, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn response as the outcome reward. To address the sparse supervision of the outcome reward, we introduce TROJail, which employs two process rewards to evaluate the utility of intermediate prompts and integrate them into advantage estimation. These rewards (1) penalize overly harmful prompts that trigger the model's refusal mechanism, and (2) encourage steering the semantic relevance of responses toward the targeted harmful content. Experimental results show improved attack success rates across multiple models and benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiqiao/TROJail. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.</description>

      <title>AI TIPS 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Operationalizing AI Governance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.</description>

      <title>Generative Digital Twins: Vision-Language Simulation Models for Executable Industrial Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Vision-Language Simulation Model (VLSM) that unifies visual and textual understanding to synthesize executable FlexScript from layout sketches and natural-language prompts, enabling cross-modal reasoning for industrial simulation systems. To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

      <title>SafePro: Evaluating the Safety of Professional-Level AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model-based agents are rapidly evolving from simple conversational assistants into autonomous systems capable of performing complex, professional-level tasks in various domains. While these advancements promise significant productivity gains, they also introduce critical safety risks that remain under-explored. Existing safety evaluations primarily focus on simple, daily assistance tasks, failing to capture the intricate decision-making processes and potential consequences of misaligned behaviors in professional settings. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{SafePro}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of AI agents performing professional activities. SafePro features a dataset of high-complexity tasks across diverse professional domains with safety risks, developed through a rigorous iterative creation and review process. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art AI models reveals significant safety vulnerabilities and uncovers new unsafe behaviors in professional contexts. We further show that these models exhibit both insufficient safety judgment and weak safety alignment when executing complex professional tasks. In addition, we investigate safety mitigation strategies for improving agent safety in these scenarios and observe encouraging improvements. Together, our findings highlight the urgent need for robust safety mechanisms tailored to the next generation of professional AI agents.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Models Will Blatantly Lie About Their Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) may not *say what they think*: they do not always volunteer information about how certain parts of the input influence their reasoning. But it is one thing for a model to *omit* such information and another, worse thing to *lie* about it. Here, we extend the work of Chen et al. (2025) to show that LRMs will do just this: they will flatly deny relying on hints provided in the prompt in answering multiple choice questions -- even when directly asked to reflect on unusual (i.e. hinted) prompt content, even when allowed to use hints, and even though experiments *show* them to be using the hints. Our results thus have discouraging implications for CoT monitoring and interpretability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.03684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain imitation learning studies how to leverage expert demonstrations of one agent to train an imitation agent with a different embodiment or morphology. Comparing trajectories and stationary distributions between the expert and imitation agents is challenging because they live on different systems that may not even have the same dimensionality. We propose Gromov-Wasserstein Imitation Learning (GWIL), a method for cross-domain imitation that uses the Gromov-Wasserstein distance to align and compare states between the different spaces of the agents. Our theory formally characterizes the scenarios where GWIL preserves optimality, revealing its possibilities and limitations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GWIL in non-trivial continuous control domains ranging from simple rigid transformation of the expert domain to arbitrary transformation of the state-action space.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Optimization With Delayed Feedback for Neural Network Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation has long been criticized for being biologically implausible due to its reliance on concepts that are not viable in natural learning processes. Two core issues are the weight transport and update locking problems caused by the forward-backward dependencies, which limit biological plausibility, computational efficiency, and parallelization. Although several alternatives have been proposed to increase biological plausibility, they often come at the cost of reduced predictive performance. This paper proposes an alternative approach to training feed-forward neural networks addressing these issues by using approximate gradient information. We introduce Feed-Forward with delayed Feedback (F$^3$), which approximates gradients using fixed random feedback paths and delayed error information from the previous epoch to balance biological plausibility with predictive performance. We evaluate F$^3$ across multiple tasks and architectures, including both fully-connected and Transformer networks. Our results demonstrate that, compared to similarly plausible approaches, F$^3$ significantly improves predictive performance, narrowing the gap to backpropagation by up to 56% for classification and 96% for regression. This work is a step towards more biologically plausible learning algorithms while opening up new avenues for energy-efficient and parallelizable neural network training.</description>

      <title>Explainable Molecular Property Prediction: Aligning Chemical Concepts with Predictions via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing explainable molecular property predictions is critical for many scientific domains, such as drug discovery and material science. Though transformer-based language models have shown great potential in accurate molecular property prediction, they neither provide chemically meaningful explanations nor faithfully reveal the molecular structure-property relationships. In this work, we develop a framework for explainable molecular property prediction based on language models, dubbed as Lamole, which can provide chemical concepts-aligned explanations. We take a string-based molecular representation -- Group SELFIES -- as input tokens to pretrain and fine-tune our Lamole, as it provides chemically meaningful semantics. By disentangling the information flows of Lamole, we propose combining self-attention weights and gradients for better quantification of each chemically meaningful substructure's impact on the model's output. To make the explanations more faithfully respect the structure-property relationship, we then carefully craft a marginal loss to explicitly optimize the explanations to be able to align with the chemists' annotations. We bridge the manifold hypothesis with the elaborated marginal loss to prove that the loss can align the explanations with the tangent space of the data manifold, leading to concept-aligned explanations. Experimental results over six mutagenicity datasets and one hepatotoxicity dataset demonstrate Lamole can achieve comparable classification accuracy and boost the explanation accuracy by up to 14.3%, being the state-of-the-art in explainable molecular property prediction.</description>

      <title>ClimateIQA: A New Dataset and Benchmark to Advance Vision-Language Models in Meteorology Anomalies Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow in parameter space is equivalent to linear interpolation in output space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the standard gradient flow in parameter space that underlies many training algorithms in deep learning can be continuously deformed into an adapted gradient flow which yields (constrained) Euclidean gradient flow in output space. Moreover, for the $L^{2}$ loss, if the Jacobian of the outputs with respect to the parameters is full rank (for fixed training data), then the time variable can be reparametrized so that the resulting flow is simply linear interpolation, and a global minimum can be achieved. For the cross-entropy loss, under the same rank condition and assuming the labels have positive components, we derive an explicit formula for the unique global minimum.</description>

      <title>Stability of Primal-Dual Gradient Flow Dynamics for Multi-Block Convex Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine stability properties of primal-dual gradient flow dynamics for composite convex optimization problems with multiple, possibly nonsmooth, terms in the objective function under the generalized consensus constraint. The proposed dynamics are based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian and they provide a viable alternative to ADMM which faces significant challenges from both analysis and implementation viewpoints in large-scale multi-block scenarios. In contrast to customized algorithms with individualized convergence guarantees, we develop a systematic approach for solving a broad class of challenging composite optimization problems. We leverage various structural properties to establish global (exponential) convergence guarantees for the proposed dynamics. Our assumptions are much weaker than those required to prove (exponential) stability of primal-dual dynamics as well as (linear) convergence of discrete-time methods such as standard two-block and multi-block ADMM and EXTRA algorithms. Finally, we show necessity of some of our structural assumptions for exponential stability and provide computational experiments to demonstrate the convenience of the proposed approach for parallel and distributed computing applications.</description>

      <title>Stuffed Mamba: Oversized States Lead to the Inability to Forget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Backpropagation: Optimization with Multi-Tangent Forward Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gradients used to train neural networks are typically computed using backpropagation. While an efficient way to obtain exact gradients, backpropagation is computationally expensive, hinders parallelization, and is biologically implausible. Forward gradients are an approach to approximate the gradients from directional derivatives along random tangents computed by forward-mode automatic differentiation. So far, research has focused on using a single tangent per step. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of multi-tangent forward gradients and introduces an improved approach to combining the forward gradients from multiple tangents based on orthogonal projections. We demonstrate that increasing the number of tangents improves both approximation quality and optimization performance across various tasks.</description>

      <title>CausAdv: A Causal-based Framework for Detecting Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has led to tremendous success in computer vision, largely due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have been shown to be vulnerable to crafted adversarial perturbations. This vulnerability of adversarial examples has has motivated research into improving model robustness through adversarial detection and defense methods. In this paper, we address the adversarial robustness of CNNs through causal reasoning. We propose CausAdv: a causal framework for detecting adversarial examples based on counterfactual reasoning. CausAdv learns both causal and non-causal features of every input, and quantifies the counterfactual information (CI) of every filter of the last convolutional layer. We then perform a statistical analysis of the filters' CI across clean and adversarial samples, to demonstrate that adversarial examples exhibit different CI distributions compared to clean samples. Our results show that causal reasoning enhances the process of adversarial detection without the need to train a separate detector. Moreover, we illustrate the efficiency of causal explanations as a helpful detection tool by visualizing the extracted causal features.</description>

      <title>KaLM: Knowledge-aligned Autoregressive Language Modeling via Dual-view Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.</description>

      <title>Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence-based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion is impractical in clinical settings, where histopathology remains the gold standard and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested in public healthcare. We experiment on two publicly available multimodal datasets, The Cancer Genomic Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium, spanning four independent cohorts: glioma-glioblastoma, renal, uterine, and breast, and observe significant performance gains in gradation and risk estimation (p-value&lt;0.05) when incorporating synthesized transcriptomic data with WSIs. Also, predictions using synthesized features were statistically close to those obtained with real transcriptomic data (p-value&gt;0.05), consistently across cohorts. Here we show that with our diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model, PathGen, gene expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predict cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed co-attention maps). PathGen code is available for open use on GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathGen.</description>

      <title>How Memory in Optimization Algorithms Implicitly Modifies the Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern optimization methods used in deep learning, each update depends on the history of previous iterations, often referred to as memory, and this dependence decays fast as the iterates go further into the past. For example, gradient descent with momentum has exponentially decaying memory through exponentially averaged past gradients. We introduce a general technique for identifying a memoryless algorithm that approximates an optimization algorithm with memory. It is obtained by replacing all past iterates in the update by the current one, and then adding a correction term arising from memory (also a function of the current iterate). This correction term can be interpreted as a perturbation of the loss, and the nature of this perturbation can inform how memory implicitly (anti-)regularizes the optimization dynamics. As an application of our theory, we find that Lion does not have the kind of implicit anti-regularization induced by memory that AdamW does, providing a theory-based explanation for Lion's better generalization performance recently documented.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Self-Pruning Intrinsic Selection Method for Training-Free Multimodal Data Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual instruction tuning adapts pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow human instructions for real-world applications. However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline. The code is available for access via \href{https://github.com/bibisbar/PRISM}{this repository}.</description>

      <title>Provocations from the Humanities for Generative AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of generative AI are experienced by a broad range of constituencies, but the disciplinary inputs to its development have been surprisingly narrow. Here we present a set of provocations from humanities researchers -- currently underrepresented in AI development -- intended to inform its future applications and enrich ongoing conversations about its uses, impact, and harms. Drawing from relevant humanities scholarship, along with foundational work in critical data studies, we elaborate eight claims with broad applicability to generative AI research: 1) Models make words, but people make meaning; 2) Generative AI requires an expanded definition of culture; 3) Generative AI can never be representative; 4) Bigger models are not always better models; 5) Not all training data is equivalent; 6) Openness is not an easy fix; 7) Limited access to compute enables corporate capture; and 8) AI universalism creates narrow human subjects. We also provide a working definition of humanities research, summarize some of its most salient theories and methods, and apply these theories and methods to the current landscape of AI. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of resisting the extraction of humanities research by computer science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</description>

      <title>Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.</description>

      <title>UniF$^2$ace: A Unified Fine-grained Face Understanding and Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08120v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\% higher VQA-score, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or &lt;&lt;expressing&gt;&gt; functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its stability to withstand re-parameterizations of the hidden space. One may think of such re-parameterizations as the work of an adversary attempting to foil the construction of the KA outer function. We find KA to be stable under countable collections of continuous re-parameterizations, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of re-parameterizations. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.</description>

      <title>Hallucination, reliability, and the role of generative AI in science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI increasingly supports scientific inference, from protein structure prediction to weather forecasting. Yet its distinctive failure mode, hallucination, raises epistemic alarm bells. I argue that this failure mode can be addressed by shifting from data-centric to phenomenon-centric assessment. Through case studies of AlphaFold and GenCast, I show how scientific workflows discipline generative models through theory-guided training and confidence-based error screening. These strategies convert hallucination from an unmanageable epistemic threat into bounded risk. When embedded in such workflows, generative models support reliable inference despite opacity, provided they operate in theoretically mature domains.</description>

      <title>MCP Bridge: A Lightweight, LLM-Agnostic RESTful Proxy for Model Context Protocol Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools through standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, current MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require local process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge computing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to multiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API. Unlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any backend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution model with three security levels-standard execution, confirmation workflow, and Docker isolation - while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP clients. However, reliable execution within this framework requires models that can strictly adhere to protocol schemas. To this end, we also fine-tuned the Qwen3 4B and 8B model family on the Agent-Ark/Toucan-1.5M dataset using four Reinforcement Learning techniques: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Dr. GRPO, Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), and Decoupled Alignment Policy Optimization (DAPO). Evaluated on the MCPToolBench++ benchmark, our optimized model achieves an F1 score of 73.0% that outperforms GPT-OSS-120B (62.17%) and remains competitive with the 70B+ parameter baselines. Evaluation demonstrates that MCP Bridge successfully addresses the constraints of direct MCP connections while providing enhanced security controls and cross-platform compatibility, enabling sophisticated LLM-powered applications in previously inaccessible environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Reproducible Biomedical Question Answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT, MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents) to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50 documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy (0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency, and scalability for biomedical QA. With open-source code, the system is fully reproducible and extensible.</description>

      <title>Focus, Merge, Rank: Improved Question Answering Based on Semi-structured Knowledge Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world settings, machine learning models and interactive systems have access to both structured knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs or tables, and unstructured content, e.g., natural language documents. However, most rely on either. Semi-Structured Knowledge Bases (SKBs) bridge this gap by linking unstructured content to nodes within structured data, thereby enabling new strategies for knowledge access and use. In this work, we present FocusedRetriever, a modular SKB-based framework for multi-hop question answering. It integrates components (VSS-based entity search, LLM-based generation of Cypher queries and pairwise re-ranking) in a way that enables it to outperform state-of-the-art methods across all three STaRK benchmark test sets, covering diverse domains and multiple performance metrics. The average first-hit rate exceeds that of the second-best method by 25.7%. FocusedRetriever leverages (1) the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract relational facts and entity attributes from unstructured text, (2) node set joins to filter answer candidates based on these extracted triplets and constraints, (3) vector similarity search to retrieve and rank relevant unstructured content, and (4) the contextual capabilities of LLMs to finally rank the top-k answers. For generality, we only incorporate base LLMs in FocusedRetriever in our evaluation. However, our analysis of intermediate results highlights several opportunities for further upgrades including finetuning.

      <title>Aligning Trustworthy AI with Democracy: A Dual Taxonomy of Opportunities and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable opportunities for democratic governance. This paper introduces a dual taxonomy to evaluate AI's complex relationship with democracy: the AI Risks to Democracy (AIRD) taxonomy, which identifies how AI can undermine core democratic principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based policymaking.
  Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning AI systems with democratic values.
  By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing so, it bridges the gap between ethical aspirations and operational realities, laying the groundwork for more inclusive, accountable, and resilient democratic systems in the algorithmic age.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning systems have centred on developing of specialised hardware for neural networks. These systems typically feature architectures that go beyond the von Neumann model employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs, offering potential efficiency and performance gains. However, neural networks developed for specialised hardware must consider its specific characteristics. This requires novel training algorithms and accurate hardware models, since they cannot be abstracted as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to training neural networks for hardware-based spiking neurons and synapses, built using ferroelectric capacitors (FeCAPs) and resistive random-access memories (RRAMs), respectively. Unlike the common approach of designing hardware to fit abstract neuron or synapse models, we start with compact models of the physical device to model the computational primitives. Based on these models, we have developed a training algorithm (BRUNO) that can reliably train the networks, even when applying hardware limitations, such as stochasticity or low bit precision. We analyse and compare BRUNO with Backpropagation Through Time. We test it on different spatio-temporal datasets. First on a music prediction dataset, where a network composed of ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF) neurons is used to predict at each time step the next musical note that should be played. The second dataset consists on the classification of the Braille letters using a network composed of quantised RRAM synapses and FeLIF neurons. The performance of this network is then compared with that of networks composed of LIF neurons. Experimental results show the potential advantages of using BRUNO by reducing the time and memory required to detect spatio-temporal patterns with quantised synapses.</description>

      <title>Token Reduction Should Go Beyond Efficiency in Generative Models -- From Vision, Language to Multimodality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Transformer architectures, tokens\textemdash discrete units derived from raw data\textemdash are formed by segmenting inputs into fixed-length chunks. Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, agentic framework design, and broader ML and scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Arctic-Text2SQL-R1: Simple Rewards, Strong Reasoning in Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Test2SQL) is a longstanding challenge at the intersection of natural language understanding and structured data access. While large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved fluency in SQL generation, producing correct and executable SQL--particularly for complex queries--remains a bottleneck. We present Arctic-Text2SQL-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework and model family designed to generate accurate, executable SQL using a lightweight reward signal based solely on execution correctness. Our approach avoids brittle intermediate supervision and complex reward shaping, promoting stable training and alignment with the end task. Combined with carefully curated data, strong supervised initialization, and effective training practices, Arctic-Text2SQL-R1 achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy across six diverse Test2SQL benchmarks, including the top position on the BIRD leaderboard. Notably, our 7B model outperforms prior 70B-class systems, highlighting the framework's scalability and efficiency. We further demonstrate inference-time robustness through simple extensions like value retrieval and majority voting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies offer both positive and negative insights, providing practical guidance for future Test2SQL research.</description>

      <title>A Differential Perspective on Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to optimize a discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to optimize the reward received per time step. In particular, we utilize a quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution, as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties. Empirically, we find that these algorithms yield competitive and sometimes superior performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also capturing rich information about the long-run per-step reward and differential return distributions.</description>

      <title>MOGO: Residual Quantized Hierarchical Causal Transformer for High-Quality and Real-Time 3D Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless, jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and (2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>DGAE: Diffusion-Guided Autoencoder for Efficient Latent Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</description>

      <title>FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs), exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability. Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.</description>

      <title>Semi-Tensor-Product Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semi-tensor product of vectors generalizes the conventional inner product, enabling algebraic operations between vectors of different dimensions. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a domain-based convolutional product and integrate it with the STP to formulate a padding-free convolutional operation. This new operation inherently avoids zero or other artificial padding, thereby eliminating redundant information and boundary artifacts commonly present in conventional convolutional neural networks. Based on this operation, we further develop an STP-based CNN framework that extends convolutional computation to irregular and cross-dimensional data domains. Applications to image processing and third-order signal identification demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in handling irregular, incomplete, and high-dimensional data without the distortions caused by padding.</description>

      <title>Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript provides a systemic and data-centric view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the fusion of data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. By formalizing this ecosystemic view, we contribute a general-purpose, fusion-oriented architecture for integrating heterogeneous knowledge, agents, and workflows-relevant to a wide range of disciplines and high-impact applications.</description>

      <title>Regression-adjusted Monte Carlo Estimators for Shapley Values and Probabilistic Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values, Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation, and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.</description>

      <title>SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs with Dynamic Intensity Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide range of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them to display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this expectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM personalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models face two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which only provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for controlling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending the Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five model, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing expressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured framework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and dynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces adjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and leverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors: \textit{Frequency}, \textit{Depth}, \textit{Threshold}, \textit{Effort}, and \textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity as a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable personality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe that changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related traits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize multi-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in isolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine interactions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing processes, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy, corresponding to a 4.0% relative gain, and by 12.0 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 15.2% relative gain. On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy, which corresponds to a 3.7% relative gain, and by 3.6 points in macro F1, corresponding to a 4.6% relative gain. When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension.The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. This is a circuit-aware reward, in contrast to the current trend of works on this topic, which are primarily fidelity-based. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables practical navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set still yields low depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach, with our completely circuit-aware method, efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</description>

Abstract: Reduced-order models are central to motion planning and control of quadruped robots, yet existing templates are often hand-crafted for a specific locomotion modality. This motivates the need for automatic methods that extract task-specific, interpretable low-dimensional dynamics directly from data. We propose a methodology that combines a linear autoencoder with symbolic regression to derive such models. The linear autoencoder provides a consistent latent embedding for configurations, velocities, accelerations, and inputs, enabling the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to operate in a compact, physics-aligned space. A multi-phase, hybrid-aware training scheme ensures coherent latent coordinates across contact transitions. We focus our validation on quadruped jumping-a representative, challenging, yet contained scenario in which a principled template model is especially valuable. The resulting symbolic dynamics outperform the state-of-the-art handcrafted actuated spring-loaded inverted pendulum (aSLIP) baseline in simulation and hardware across multiple robots and jumping modalities.</description>

      <title>Vocabulary Expansion of Large Language Models via Kullback-Leibler-Based Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL divergence, even when the original and extended models use different tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training, evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of embedding space during vocabulary expansion.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Thought: Tracking LLM Overthinking via Reasoning Dynamics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time scaling via explicit reasoning trajectories significantly boosts large language model (LLM) performance but often triggers overthinking. To explore this, we analyze reasoning through two lenses: Reasoning Length Dynamics, which reveals a compensatory trade-off between thinking and answer content length that eventually leads to thinking redundancy, and Reasoning Semantic Dynamics, which identifies semantic convergence and repetitive oscillations. These dynamics uncover an instance-specific Reasoning Completion Point (RCP), beyond which computation continues without further performance gain. Since the RCP varies across instances, we propose a Reasoning Completion Point Detector (RCPD), an inference-time early-exit method that identifies the RCP by monitoring the rank dynamics of termination tokens (e.g., &lt;/think&gt;). Across AIME and GPQA benchmarks using Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1, RCPD reduces token usage by up to 44% while preserving accuracy, offering a principled approach to efficient test-time scaling.</description>

      <title>SLogic: Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule Learning for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph completion (KGC) by capturing compositional relationships in the form of human-readable inference rules. While existing logical rule-based methods learn rule confidence scores, they typically assign a global weight to each rule schema, applied uniformly across the graph. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's importance often varies depending on the specific query instance. To address this, we introduce SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a context-aware scoring function. This function determines the importance of a rule by analyzing the subgraph locally defined by the query's head entity, thereby enabling a differentiated weighting of rules specific to their local query contexts. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SLogic outperforms existing rule-based methods and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines. It also generates query-dependent, human-readable logical rules that serve as explicit explanations for its inferences.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility Datasets Enriched With Contextual and Social Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.</description>

      <title>AutoContext: Instance-Level Context Learning for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current LLM agents typically lack instance-level context, which comprises concrete facts such as environment structure, system configurations, and local mechanics. Consequently, existing methods are forced to intertwine exploration with task execution. This coupling leads to redundant interactions and fragile decision-making, as agents must repeatedly rediscover the same information for every new task. To address this, we introduce AutoContext, a method that decouples exploration from task solving. AutoContext performs a systematic, one-off exploration to construct a reusable knowledge graph for each environment instance. This structured context allows off-the-shelf agents to access necessary facts directly, eliminating redundant exploration. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, Crafter, and InterCode-Bash demonstrate substantial gains: for example, the success rate of a ReAct agent on TextWorld improves from 37% to 95%, highlighting the critical role of structured instance context in efficient agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Foundations of LLM Knowledge Materialization: Termination, Reproducibility, Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, yet measuring and systematizing this knowledge remains challenging. Converting it into structured format, for example through recursive extraction approaches such as the GPTKB methodology (Hu et al., 2025b), is still underexplored. Key open questions include whether such extraction can terminate, whether its outputs are reproducible, and how robust they are to variations. We systematically study LLM knowledge materialization using miniGPTKBs (domain-specific, tractable subcrawls), analyzing termination, reproducibility, and robustness across three categories of metrics: yield, lexical similarity, and semantic similarity. We experiment with four variations (seed, language, randomness, model) and three illustrative domains (from history, entertainment, and finance). Our findings show (i) high termination rates, though model-dependent; (ii) mixed reproducibility; and (iii) robustness that varies by perturbation type: high for seeds and temperature, lower for languages and models. These results suggest that LLM knowledge materialization can reliably surface core knowledge, while also revealing important limitations.</description>

      <title>Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems increasingly power everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on manually well-crafted prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to query poisoning alone: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to {\Delta}ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability. We also propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake reward {\Delta}ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.</description>

      <title>Instructions are all you need: Self-supervised Reinforcement Learning for Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn instruction following.

      <title>WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals into physiological activity, pathological (epileptic) activity, power-line noise, and other non-cerebral artifacts. Traditional methods for iEEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of iEEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,231 samples using a 70/20/10 split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous non-specialized CNN- and LSTM-based approaches and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model achieves high discrimination of noise and artifact classes, with precisions of 0.98 and approximately 1, respectively. Classification between physiological and pathological signals exhibits a modest but clinically interpretable overlap, with F1-scores of 0.96 and 0.90 and 175 and 272 cross-class false positives, respectively, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well-suited for iEEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling the capture of both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The study also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning, the use of focal loss to address class imbalance, and normalization steps that support high model performance. While the results demonstrate strong in-distribution performance, generalizability across datasets and clinical settings has yet to be established.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Stable Quaternion-valued Hopfield-structured Neural Network with Periodic Projection-based Supervised Learning Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms, where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Differentially Private Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning (RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains, however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG), natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity, while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO algorithms.</description>

      <title>QueryIPI: Query-agnostic Indirect Prompt Injection on Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern coding agents integrated into IDEs orchestrate powerful tools and high-privilege system access, creating a high-stakes attack surface. Prior work on Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) is mainly query-specific, requiring particular user queries as triggers and leading to poor generalizability. We propose query-agnostic IPI, a new attack paradigm that reliably executes malicious payloads under arbitrary user queries. Our key insight is that malicious payloads should leverage the invariant prompt context (i.e., system prompt and tool descriptions) rather than variant user queries. We present QueryIPI, an automated framework that uses tool descriptions as optimizable payloads and refines them via iterative, prompt-based blackbox optimization. QueryIPI leverages system invariants for initial seed generation aligned with agent conventions, and iterative reflection to resolve instruction-following failures and safety refusals. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87% success rate, outperforming the best baseline (50%). Crucially, generated malicious descriptions transfer to real-world coding agents, highlighting a practical security risk.</description>

      <title>LLM generation novelty through the lens of semantic similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generation novelty is a key indicator of an LLM's ability to generalize, yet measuring it against full pretraining corpora is computationally challenging. Existing evaluations often rely on lexical overlap, failing to detect paraphrased text, or do not consider the full pretraining corpus. We frame novelty as a semantic retrieval problem. This framing enables us to address novelty with modern embedding and indexing pipelines, allowing for efficient analysis at pre-training scale. Specifically, we propose a three-stage framework that retrieves semantically similar samples, reranks them at varying subsequence lengths, and calibrates scores using a human novelty reference for interpretability. We apply this framework to the SmolLM model family and report three key findings: (1) models draw on pre-training data across much longer sequences than previously reported; (2) some task domains systematically promote or suppress generation novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also increases novelty. These results highlight the value of semantic novelty analysis for studying generalization. To support reproducibility and further research, we release ~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm</description>

      <title>Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.</description>

      <title>Multi-Personality Generation of LLMs at Decoding-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-personality generation for LLMs, enabling simultaneous embodiment of multiple personalization attributes, is a fundamental challenge. Existing retraining-based approaches are costly and poorly scalable, while decoding-time methods often rely on external models or heuristics, limiting flexibility and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Personality Generation (MPG) framework under the decoding-time combination paradigm. It flexibly controls multi-personality without relying on scarce multi-dimensional models or extra training, leveraging implicit density ratios in single-dimensional models as a "free lunch" to reformulate the task as sampling from a target strategy aggregating these ratios. To implement MPG efficiently, we design Speculative Chunk-level based Rejection sampling (SCR), which generates responses in chunks and parallelly validates them via estimated thresholds within a sliding window. This significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining high-quality generation. Experiments on MBTI personality and Role-Playing demonstrate the effectiveness of MPG, showing improvements up to 16%-18%.

      <title>Aligning by Misaligning: Boundary-aware Curriculum Learning for Multimodal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most multimodal models treat every negative pair alike, ignoring the ambiguous negatives that differ from the positive by only a small detail. We propose Boundary-Aware Curriculum with Local Attention (BACL), a lightweight add-on that turns these borderline cases into a curriculum signal. A Boundary-aware Negative Sampler gradually raises difficulty, while a Contrastive Local Attention loss highlights where the mismatch occurs. The two modules are fully differentiable and work with any off-the-shelf dual encoder. Theory predicts a fast O(1/n) error rate; practice shows up to +32% R@1 over CLIP and new SOTA on four large-scale benchmarks, all without extra labels.</description>

      <title>PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.</description>

      <title>On the Entropy Calibration of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing as generations grow longer, due to error accumulation. To calibrate the model and improve text quality, it has become standard practice to truncate the distribution, but this approach reduces output diversity, which we would like to avoid. Therefore, in this paper, we ask: does miscalibration improve automatically with scale, and if not, is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the rate of scaling depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted theoretically: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Fine-Tuning via Reparameterized Policy Gradient of the Soft Q-Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-likelihood samples but often require alignment with downstream objectives. Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF), a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment. Furthermore, in online black-box optimization, SQDF attains high sample efficiency while maintaining naturalness and diversity.</description>

      <title>On the Theoretical Foundation of Sparse Dictionary Learning in Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI models achieve remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, understanding what representations they learn and how they process information has become increasingly important for both scientific progress and trustworthy deployment. Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode diverse concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into monosemantic features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framework and provide rigorous analysis of the optimization landscape. We provide novel theoretical explanations for empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption and dead neurons. We design the Linear Representation Bench, a benchmark that strictly follows the Linear Representation Hypothesis, to evaluate SDL methods with fully accessible ground-truth features. Motivated by our theory and findings, we develop feature achoring, a novel technique applicable for all SDL methods, to enhance their feature recovery capabilities.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: Criticality of Form and Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how network structure constrains and enables information processing is a central problem in the statistical mechanics of interacting systems. Here we study random networks across the structural percolation transition and analyze how connectivity governs realizable input-output transformations under cascade dynamics. Using Erdos-Renyi networks as a minimal ensemble, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree. We find that the emergence of the giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow, quantified by transfer entropy, extends beyond local neighborhoods. We term this coincidence of structural, functional, and informational transitions functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the percolation threshold. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality may provide a general organizing principle of information processing capacity in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Prompt Engineering: From Heuristics to Expressivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompts can switch a model's behavior even when the weights are fixed, yet this phenomenon is rarely treated as a clean theoretical object rather than a heuristic. We study the family of functions obtainable by holding a Transformer backbone fixed as an executor and varying only the prompt. Our core idea is to view the prompt as an externally injected program and to construct a simplified Transformer that interprets it to implement different computations. The construction exposes a mechanism-level decomposition: attention performs selective routing from prompt memory, the FFN performs local arithmetic conditioned on retrieved fragments, and depth-wise stacking composes these local updates into a multi-step computation. Under this viewpoint, we prove a constructive existential result showing that a single fixed backbone can approximate a broad class of target behaviors via prompts alone. The framework provides a unified starting point for formalizing trade-offs under prompt length/precision constraints and for studying structural limits of prompt-based switching, while remaining distinct from empirical claims about pretrained LLMs.</description>

      <title>Memory in the Age of AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.</description>

      <title>When Does Learning Renormalize? Sufficient Conditions for Power Law Spectral Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18209v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical power--law scaling has been widely observed across modern deep learning systems, yet its theoretical origins and scope of validity remain incompletely understood. The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.
  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form.</description>

      <title>PathoSyn: Imaging-Pathology MRI Synthesis via Disentangled Deviation Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>AgenticTCAD: A LLM-based Multi-Agent Framework for Automated TCAD Code Generation and Device Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the continued scaling of advanced technology nodes, the design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) paradigm has become increasingly critical, rendering efficient device design and optimization essential. In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.</description>

      <title>Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts</title>

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens, but by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, which contributes to poor relational generalization (the reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. Cognitive science, by contrast, shows that human comprehension converts linguistic input into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by these findings, we introduce the Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction: tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a working memory of prior sentence representations. Token and sentence representations are generated using a shared stack of transformer blocks and trained with a single objective, next-token prediction loss. By retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to working memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters that generate earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves data and parameter efficiency compared to matched GPT-2 runs and other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's test loss. TG also reduces errors in relational-direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.</description>

      <title>Permission Manifests for Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents represents a significant shift in automated interactions with the web. Unlike traditional crawlers that follow simple conventions, such as robots$.$txt, modern agents engage with websites in sophisticated ways: navigating complex interfaces, extracting structured information, and completing end-to-end tasks. Existing governance mechanisms were not designed for these capabilities. Without a way to specify what interactions are and are not allowed, website owners increasingly rely on blanket blocking and CAPTCHAs, which undermine beneficial applications such as efficient automation, convenient use of e-commerce services, and accessibility tools. We introduce agent-permissions$.$json, a robots$.$txt-style lightweight manifest where websites specify allowed interactions, complemented by API references where available. This framework provides a low-friction coordination mechanism: website owners only need to write a simple JSON file, while agents can easily parse and automatically implement the manifest's provisions. Website owners can then focus on blocking non-compliant agents, rather than agents as a whole. By extending the spirit of robots$.$txt to the era of LLM-mediated interaction, and complementing data use initiatives such as AIPref, the manifest establishes a compliance framework that enables beneficial agent interactions while respecting site owners' preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of decentralization of autoregressive generation. We define the Decentralized Discrete Flow Matching objective, by expressing probability generating velocity as a linear combination of expert flows. We also conduct experiments demonstrating the equivalence between decentralized and centralized training settings for multimodal language models across diverse set of benchmarks. Specifically, we compare two distinct paradigms: LLaVA and InternVL 2.5-1B, which uses a fixed CLIP vision encoder and performs full-parameter fine-tuning (ViT+MLP+LLM) during the instruction tuning stage.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Representation Theorem for Linear GENEOs in Geometric Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Apollo: Unified Multi-Task Audio-Video Joint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Apollo and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Apollo scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Vision for Multisensory Intelligence: Sensing, Science, and Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our experience of the world is multisensory, spanning a synthesis of language, sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. Yet, artificial intelligence has primarily advanced in digital modalities like text, vision, and audio. This paper outlines a research vision for multisensory artificial intelligence over the next decade. This new set of technologies can change how humans and AI experience and interact with one another, by connecting AI to the human senses and a rich spectrum of signals from physiological and tactile cues on the body, to physical and social signals in homes, cities, and the environment. We outline how this field must advance through three interrelated themes of sensing, science, and synergy. Firstly, research in sensing should extend how AI captures the world in richer ways beyond the digital medium. Secondly, developing a principled science for quantifying multimodal heterogeneity and interactions, developing unified modeling architectures and representations, and understanding cross-modal transfer. Finally, we present new technical challenges to learn synergy between modalities and between humans and AI, covering multisensory integration, alignment, reasoning, generation, generalization, and experience. Accompanying this vision paper are a series of projects, resources, and demos of latest advances from the Multisensory Intelligence group at the MIT Media Lab, see https://mit-mi.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Precision over Diversity: High-Precision Reward Generalizes to Robust Instruction Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central belief in scaling reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for instruction following (IF) tasks is that, a diverse mixture of verifiable hard and unverifiable soft constraints is essential for generalizing to unseen instructions. In this work, we challenge this prevailing consensus through a systematic empirical investigation. Counter-intuitively, we find that models trained on hard-only constraints consistently outperform those trained on mixed datasets. Extensive experiments reveal that reward precision, rather than constraint diversity, is the primary driver of effective alignment. The LLM judge suffers from a low recall rate in detecting false response, which leads to severe reward hacking, thereby undermining the benefits of diversity. Furthermore, analysis of the attention mechanism reveals that high-precision rewards develop a transferable meta-skill for IF. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data-centric refinement strategy that prioritizes reward precision. Evaluated on five benchmarks, our approach outperforms competitive baselines by 13.4\% in performance while achieving a 58\% reduction in training time, maintaining strong generalization beyond instruction following. Our findings advocate for a paradigm shift: moving away from the indiscriminate pursuit of data diversity toward high-precision rewards.</description>

      <title>STELP: Secure Transpilation and Execution of LLM-Generated Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved major advances in reasoning, planning, and function-calling capabilities. Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</description>

      <title>The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), and Self-Exploration (van der Waals-like). Analysis of distilled trajectories reveals these structures emerge from Long CoT fine-tuning, not keyword imitation. We introduce Effective Semantic Isomers and show that only bonds promoting fast entropy convergence support stable Long CoT learning, while structural competition impairs training. Drawing on these findings, we present Mole-Syn, a distribution-transfer-graph method that guides synthesis of effective Long CoT structures, boosting performance and RL stability across benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Data Work in Egypt: Who Are the Workers Behind Artificial Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The report highlights the role of Egyptian data workers in the global value chains of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These workers generate and annotate data for machine learning, check outputs, and they connect with overseas AI producers via international digital labor platforms, where they perform on-demand tasks and are typically paid by piecework, with no long-term commitment. Most of these workers are young, highly educated men, with nearly two-thirds holding undergraduate degrees. Their primary motivation for data work is financial need, with three-quarters relying on platform earnings to cover basic necessities. Despite the variability in their online earnings, these are generally low, often equaling Egypt's minimum wage. Data workers' digital identities are shaped by algorithmic control and economic demands, often diverging from their offline selves. Nonetheless, they find ways to resist, exercise ethical agency, and maintain autonomy. The report evaluates the potential impact of Egypt's newly enacted labor law and suggests policy measures to improve working conditions and acknowledge the role of these workers in AI's global value chains.</description>

      <title>GenAITEd Ghana: A First-of-Its-Kind Context-Aware and Curriculum-Aligned Conversational AI Agent for Teacher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global frameworks increasingly advocate for Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, yet they provide limited guidance on how ethical, culturally responsive, and curriculum-aligned AI can be operationalized within functioning teacher education systems, particularly in the Global South. This study addresses this gap through the design and evaluation of GenAITEd Ghana, a context-aware, region-specific conversational AI prototype developed to support teacher education in Ghana. Guided by a Design Science Research approach, the system was developed as a school-mimetic digital infrastructure aligned with the organizational logic of Ghanaian Colleges of Education and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA) framework. GenAITEd Ghana operates as a multi-agent, retrieval-augmented conversational AI that coordinates multiple models for curriculum-grounded dialogue, automatic speech recognition, voice synthesis, and multimedia interaction. Two complementary prompt pathways were embedded: system-level prompts that enforce curriculum boundaries, ethical constraints, and teacher-in-the-loop oversight, and interaction-level semi-automated prompts that structure live pedagogical dialogue through clarification, confirmation, and guided response generation. Evaluation findings show that the system effectively enacted key Responsible AI principles, including transparency, accountability, cultural responsiveness, privacy, and human oversight. Human expert evaluations further indicated that GenAITEd Ghana is pedagogically appropriate for Ghanaian teacher education, promoting student engagement while preserving educators' professional authority. Identified challenges highlight the need for continued model integration, professional development, and critical AI literacy to mitigate risks of over-reliance.</description>

      <title>When Smaller Wins: Dual-Stage Distillation and Pareto-Guided Compression of Liquid Neural Networks for Edge Battery Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery management systems increasingly require accurate battery health prognostics under strict on-device constraints. This paper presents DLNet, a practical framework with dual-stage distillation of liquid neural networks that turns a high-capacity model into compact and edge-deployable models for battery health prediction. DLNet first applies Euler discretization to reformulate liquid dynamics for embedded compatibility. It then performs dual-stage knowledge distillation to transfer the teacher model's temporal behavior and recover it after further compression. Pareto-guided selection under joint error-cost objectives retains student models that balance accuracy and efficiency. We evaluate DLNet on a widely used dataset and validate real-device feasibility on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense using int8 deployment. The final deployed student achieves a low error of 0.0066 when predicting battery health over the next 100 cycles, which is 15.4% lower than the teacher model. It reduces the model size from 616 kB to 94 kB with 84.7% reduction and takes 21 ms per inference on the device. These results support a practical smaller wins observation that a small model can match or exceed a large teacher for edge-based prognostics with proper supervision and selection. Beyond batteries, the DLNet framework can extend to other industrial analytics tasks with strict hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>MemGovern: Enhancing Code Agents through Learning from Governed Human Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While autonomous software engineering (SWE) agents are reshaping programming paradigms, they currently suffer from a "closed-world" limitation: they attempt to fix bugs from scratch or solely using local context, ignoring the immense historical human experience available on platforms like GitHub. Accessing this open-world experience is hindered by the unstructured and fragmented nature of real-world issue-tracking data. In this paper, we introduce MemGovern, a framework designed to govern and transform raw GitHub data into actionable experiential memory for agents. MemGovern employs experience governance to convert human experience into agent-friendly experience cards and introduces an agentic experience search strategy that enables logic-driven retrieval of human expertise. By producing 135K governed experience cards, MemGovern achieves a significant performance boost, improving resolution rates on the SWE-bench Verified by 4.65%. As a plug-in approach, MemGovern provides a solution for agent-friendly memory infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Measuring Iterative Temporal Reasoning with Time Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Time Puzzles, a constraint-based date inference task for evaluating iterative temporal reasoning. Each puzzle combines factual temporal anchors with (cross-cultural) calendar relations, admits one or multiple valid solution dates, and is algorithmically generated for controlled, dynamic, and continual evaluation. Across 13 diverse LLMs, Time Puzzles well distinguishes their iterative temporal reasoning capabilities and remains challenging without tools: GPT-5 reaches only 49.3% accuracy and all other models stay below 31%, despite the dataset's simplicity. Web search consistently yields substantial gains and using code interpreter shows mixed effects, but all models perform much better when constraints are rewritten with explicit dates, revealing a gap in reliable tool use. Overall, Time Puzzles presents a simple, cost-effective diagnostic for tool-augmented iterative temporal reasoning.</description>

      <title>PRPO: Aligning Process Reward with Outcome Reward in Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy optimization for large language models often suffers from sparse reward signals in multi-step reasoning tasks. Critic-free methods like GRPO assign a single normalized outcome reward to all tokens, providing limited guidance for intermediate reasoning . While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer dense feedback, they risk premature collapse when used alone, as early low-reward tokens can drive policies toward truncated outputs. We introduce Process Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), which combines outcome reliability with process-level guidance in a critic-free framework. PRPO segments reasoning sequences based on semantic clues, normalizes PRM scores into token-level advantages, and aligns their distribution with outcome advantages through location-parameter shift. On MATH500, PRPO improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B accuracy from 61.2% to 64.4% over GRPO using only eight rollouts and no value network, demonstrating efficient fine-grained credit assignment within critic-free optimization.

      <title>Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

      <title>ES-Mem: Event Segmentation-Based Memory for Long-Term Dialogue Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory is critical for dialogue agents to maintain coherence and enable continuous adaptation in long-term interactions. While existing memory mechanisms offer basic storage and retrieval capabilities, they are hindered by two primary limitations: (1) rigid memory granularity often disrupts semantic integrity, resulting in fragmented and incoherent memory units; (2) prevalent flat retrieval paradigms rely solely on surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the structural cues of discourse required to navigate and locate specific episodic contexts. To mitigate these limitations, drawing inspiration from Event Segmentation Theory, we propose ES-Mem, a framework incorporating two core components: (1) a dynamic event segmentation module that partitions long-term interactions into semantically coherent events with distinct boundaries; (2) a hierarchical memory architecture that constructs multi-layered memories and leverages boundary semantics to anchor specific episodic memory for precise context localization. Evaluations on two memory benchmarks demonstrate that ES-Mem yields consistent performance gains over baseline methods. Furthermore, the proposed event segmentation module exhibits robust applicability on dialogue segmentation datasets.</description>
