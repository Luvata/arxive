      <title>Local Timescale Gates for Timescale-Robust Continual Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals, addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Lifting Manifolds to Mitigate Pseudo-Alignment in LLM4TS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce \textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>FedGTEA: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning, called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings, aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting, consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning at the Speed of Physics: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning, and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform their optimization.</description>

      <title>Pruning Cannot Hurt Robustness: Certified Trade-offs in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns. While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool but as a structural intervention for robust RL.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Memorization Risk in Healthcare Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) hold promise for clinical applications. However, their capacity to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in Deep Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion, Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1% explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Balancing Performance and Reject Inclusion: A Novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation Framework for Credit Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics. However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.</description>

      <title>A Connection Between Score Matching and Local Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss, motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator. Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.</description>

      <title>Reference-Specific Unlearning Metrics Can Hide the Truth: A Reality Check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning. Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.</description>

      <title>CSI-4CAST: A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for CSI Prediction with Comprehensive Robustness and Generalization Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost, outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario, the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and 3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols (https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and efficient CSI prediction.</description>

      <title>Max It or Miss It: Benchmarking LLM On Solving Extremal Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.</description>

      <title>AMORE: Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network for Stiff Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE, Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples: the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.</description>

      <title>Escaping Local Optima in the Waddington Landscape: A Multi-Stage TRPO-PPO Approach for Single-Cell Perturbation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However, these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet, an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver, scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Ultrasonic Weld Characterization Using Hierarchical Wave Modeling and Diffusion-Driven Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</description>

      <title>Information Shapes Koopman Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community. However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning, where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma: constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive. Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast, expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan52/InformationKoopman.</description>

      <title>Bridging Idealized and Operational Models: An Explainable AI Framework for Earth System Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system. While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns, leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing communication between modeling communities.</description>

      <title>Randomness and Interpolation Improve Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process. Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks) with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD, implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.</description>

      <title>An Operational Deep Learning System for Satellite-Based High-Resolution Global Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12 hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg} (~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US. Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations into weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step, an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights, which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Achieving Logarithmic Regret in KL-Regularized Zero-Sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization). Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$ which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings</description>

      <title>Absolute indices for determining compactness, separability and number of clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters. Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters. Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin. The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other widely-used cluster validity indices.</description>

      <title>NeuroRVQ: Multi-Scale EEG Tokenization for Generative Large Brainwave Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Scalable Beamforming Optimization via Deep Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm, a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and online learning approaches.</description>

      <title>DeepCausalMMM: A Deep Learning Framework for Marketing Mix Modeling with Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning [@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with 14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.</description>

      <title>Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics; yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and \emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins). Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings) affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).</description>

      <title>On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Based Client Selection for Dependent Multi-Task Federated Learning in Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within mobile edge computing (MEC) environments, particularly under the dependent multi-task settings, to reduce the total time required to complete various learning tasks. We propose CoDa-FL, a Cluster-oriented and Dependency-aware framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower communication and computational costs, and higher learning accuracy under heterogeneous MEC settings.</description>

      <title>Convergence, design and training of continuous-time dropout as a random batch method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable runtime and memory profiles.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Embeddings of Programs: A Quasi-Dynamic Approach for Optimization Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words. Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.</description>

      <title>Universally Invariant Learning in Equivariant GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and 2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining strong practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Criteria for Knowledge Distillation in Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer "teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video, audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving the performance of weaker modalities.</description>

      <title>CleverCatch: A Knowledge-Guided Weak Supervision Model for Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of 1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency, offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Ising and QUBO Variable Encodings in Boltzmann Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO, centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies. These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Valuable Preference Data for Large Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our findings and new methods.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Graph Domain Adaptation: A Spectral Contrastive Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover, the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of perspective-aware classification introduces a bottleneck in terms of parametric efficiency that did not get enough recognition in existing studies. In this article, we aim to address this issue by applying an existing architecture, the hypernetwork+adapters combination, to perspectivist classification. Ultimately, we arrive at a solution that can compete with specialized models in adopting user perspectives on hate speech and toxicity detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out of the box.</description>

      <title>BlendFL: Blended Federated Learning for Handling Multimodal Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients, existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in `ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset. In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data, thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches, accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial, such as in healthcare and finance.</description>

      <title>To Steer or Not to Steer? Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed, manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering, MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction, and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective, non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient approach to mechanistic activation steering.</description>

      <title>Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction via Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP achieves more adaptive prediction sets.</description>

      <title>Km-scale dynamical downscaling through conformalized latent diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling. Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates, incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological fields.</description>

      <title>Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations for Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring. Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information: smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance over 11 baseline methods.</description>

      <title>RockNet: Distributed Learning on Ultra-Low-Power Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning. Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with state-of-the-art accuracy.</description>

      <title>When In Doubt, Abstain: The Impact of Abstention on Strategic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility (or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents, especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.</description>

      <title>Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Kernel Representation and Similarity Measure for Incomplete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/proximity-kernel-2289.</description>

      <title>Generalist++: A Meta-learning Framework for Mitigating Trade-off in Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks, each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the future.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on Transformers in Online Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs, share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks, and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical guidance for applying transformers in online RL.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning-Based Dependency Modeling for Anomaly Detection in Cloud Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space. Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC, while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong adaptability and stability in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Prediction Markets with Intermittent Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market design.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing the robustness of heterogeneous treatment effects in survival analysis under informative censoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e., dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together, our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>SWIR-LightFusion: Multi-spectral Semantic Fusion of Synthetic SWIR with {Thermal} IR {(LWIR/MWIR)} and RGB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems. Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR / LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information, particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Storage Overhead of User Behavior Log for ML-embedded Mobile Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps, leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then, AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44% with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage), providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device ML.</description>

      <title>When Embedding Models Meet: Procrustes Bounds and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce representations that encode stable information but are not directly interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Modeling Adoptive Cell Therapy in Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data using PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Interval Type-2 Mamdani-TSK Fuzzy System for Regression Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths: interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4 datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to 19%.</description>

      <title>Rectify and Align GPS Points to Parking Spots via Rank-1 Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management, parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides, the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error. Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper, motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible at:https://github.com/pangjunbiao/ITS-Parking-spots-Dataset.</description>

      <title>Neural Sum-of-Squares: Certifying the Nonnegativity of Polynomials with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS) property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial, thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.</description>

      <title>$L_2$-Regularized Empirical Risk Minimization Guarantees Small Smooth Calibration Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source code to reproduce all experiments is available at https://github.com/msfuji0211/erm_calibration.</description>

      <title>Towards Blackwell Optimality: Bellman Optimality Is All You Can Get</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although average gain optimality is a commonly adopted performance measure in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), it is often too asymptotic. Further incorporating measures of immediate losses leads to the hierarchy of bias optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is possible to do so.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, enhancing capabilities in both language understanding and generation across diverse domains. However, developing LLMs for Arabic presents unique challenges. This paper explores these challenges by focusing on critical aspects such as data curation, tokenizer design, and evaluation. We detail our approach to the collection and filtration of Arabic pre-training datasets, assess the impact of various tokenizer designs on model performance, and examine the limitations of existing Arabic evaluation frameworks, for which we propose a systematic corrective methodology. To promote transparency and facilitate collaborative development, we share our data and methodologies, contributing to the advancement of language modeling, particularly for the Arabic language.</description>

      <title>DistilCLIP-EEG: Enhancing Epileptic Seizure Detection Through Multi-modal Learning and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$ local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.</description>

      <title>K-Merge: Online Continual Merging of Adapters for On-device Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of on-device settings.</description>

      <title>ProtoTopic: Prototypical Network for Few-Shot Medical Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate medically relevant topics even with limited data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective $\textit{min-max}$ Online Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$ compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences, we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the $K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its $\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$ regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known $\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log K})$.</description>

      <title>DOLFIN: Balancing Stability and Plasticity in Federated Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments. Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.</description>

      <title>Selective Adversarial Attacks on LLM Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment, develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.</description>

      <title>ArtNet: Hierarchical Clustering-Based Artificial Netlist Generator for ML and DTCO Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters, ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original (real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of targeted full-scale block designs.</description>

      <title>EEGChaT: A Transformer-Based Modular Channel Selector for SEEG Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings. EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy, achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural signal relevance.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware, multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical constraints and geometric prior.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Knowledge Removal in Federated Learning with High Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process, which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.</description>

      <title>Message Passing on the Edge: Towards Scalable and Expressive GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures, EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Manifold Decoders: A Framework for Generative Modeling from Nonlinear Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE, Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces. Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for visualization and analysis.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Gate-Based Quantum Reservoir Computing on NISQ Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively, performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and, interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that several popular algorithms for reinforcement learning in large language models with binary rewards can be viewed as stochastic gradient ascent on a monotone transform of the probability of a correct answer given a prompt. In particular, the transformation associated with rejection sampling algorithms is the logarithm and that associated with the GRPO algorithm is the arcsine of the square root.</description>

      <title>Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.</description>

      <title>Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class. Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance compared to several baseline and state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular datasets.</description>

      <title>Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.</description>

      <title>Adam or Gauss-Newton? A Comparative Study In Terms of Basis Alignment and SGD Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings. Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Reward Modeling for Stable RLHF: Detecting and Mitigating Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution. Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively advancing the state of RLHF.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Embeddings Improve Sample Efficiency in Actor-Critic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.</description>

      <title>Don't Be Greedy, Just Relax! Pruning LLMs via Frank-Wolfe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However, finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to integrality.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Geographic Generalization and Physical Consistency of Generative Models for Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability, with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency. Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g., central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia, Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for reproducing the experimental results can be found at https://github.com/CarloSaccardi/PSD-Downscaling</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs. This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>Progressive multi-fidelity learning for physical system predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data. Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.</description>

      <title>Tensor Gaussian Processes: Efficient Solvers for Nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process (GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution. This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs, substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>UrbanFusion: Stochastic Multimodal Fusion for Contrastive Learning of Robust Spatial Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data. Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios.

      <title>The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</description>

      <title>T3former: Temporal Graph Classification with Topological Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.</description>

      <title>Provably Invincible Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Systems: A Rate-Distortion Information-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control problems frequently arise in scientific and industrial applications, where the objective is to steer a dynamical system from an initial state to a desired target state. Recent advances in deep learning and automatic differentiation have made applying these methods to control problems increasingly practical. In this paper, we examine the use of neural networks and modern machine-learning libraries to parameterize control inputs across discrete-time and continuous-time systems, as well as deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We highlight applications in multiple domains, including biology, engineering, physics, and medicine. For continuous-time dynamical systems, neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) offer a useful approach to parameterizing control inputs. For discrete-time systems, we show how custom control-input parameterizations can be implemented and optimized using automatic-differentiation methods. Overall, the methods presented provide practical solutions for control tasks that are computationally demanding or analytically intractable, making them valuable for complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Applying Graph Analysis for Unsupervised Fast Malware Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware proliferation is increasing at a tremendous rate, with hundreds of thousands of new samples identified daily. Manual investigation of such a vast amount of malware is an unrealistic, time-consuming, and overwhelming task. To cope with this volume, there is a clear need to develop specialized techniques and efficient tools for preliminary filtering that can group malware based on semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose TrapNet, a novel, scalable, and unsupervised framework for malware fingerprinting and grouping. TrapNet employs graph community detection techniques for malware fingerprinting and family attribution based on static analysis, as follows: (1) TrapNet detects packed binaries and unpacks them using known generic packer tools. (2) From each malware sample, it generates a digest that captures the underlying semantics. Since the digest must be dense, efficient, and suitable for similarity checking, we designed FloatHash (FH), a novel numerical fuzzy hashing technique that produces a short real-valued vector summarizing the underlying assembly items and their order. FH is based on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ordered assembly items (e.g., opcodes, function calls) extracted from the malware's assembly code. (3) Representing malware with short numerical vectors enables high-performance, large-scale similarity computation, which allows TrapNet to build a malware similarity network. (4) Finally, TrapNet employs state-of-the-art community detection algorithms to identify dense communities, which represent groups of malware with similar semantics. Our extensive evaluation of TrapNet demonstrates its effectiveness in terms of the coverage and purity of the detected communities, while also highlighting its runtime efficiency, which outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.</description>

      <title>Evidence Without Injustice: A New Counterfactual Test for Fair Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural injustice. Our paradigmatic pair of examples contrasts a predictive policing algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system that records ongoing offenses, both designed to guide police deployment. In evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test.</description>

      <title>Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation (CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation, including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.</description>

      <title>SimKey: A Semantically Aware Key Module for Watermarking Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of text generated by large language models (LLMs) makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic human writing from machine output. Watermarking offers a promising solution: model owners can embed an imperceptible signal into generated text, marking its origin. Most leading approaches seed an LLM's next-token sampling with a pseudo-random key that can later be recovered to identify the text as machine-generated, while only minimally altering the model's output distribution. However, these methods suffer from two related issues: (i) watermarks are brittle to simple surface-level edits such as paraphrasing or reordering; and (ii) adversaries can append unrelated, potentially harmful text that inherits the watermark, risking reputational damage to model owners. To address these issues, we introduce SimKey, a semantic key module that strengthens watermark robustness by tying key generation to the meaning of prior context. SimKey uses locality-sensitive hashing over semantic embeddings to ensure that paraphrased text yields the same watermark key, while unrelated or semantically shifted text produces a different one. Integrated with state-of-the-art watermarking schemes, SimKey improves watermark robustness to paraphrasing and translation while preventing harmful content from false attribution, establishing semantic-aware keying as a practical and extensible watermarking direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman &amp; Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</description>

      <title>MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -&gt; verify -&gt; refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.</description>

Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.</description>

      <title>Protenix-Mini+: efficient structure prediction model with scalable pairformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. While AF3 and its variants (e.g., Protenix, Chai-1) have advanced structure prediction results, they suffer from critical limitations: high inference latency and cubic time complexity with respect to token count, both of which restrict scalability for large biomolecular complexes. To address the core challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy, we introduce three key innovations: (1) compressing non-scalable operations to mitigate cubic time complexity, (2) removing redundant blocks across modules to reduce unnecessary overhead, and (3) adopting a few-step sampler for the atom diffusion module to accelerate inference. Building on these design principles, we develop Protenix-Mini+, a highly lightweight and scalable variant of the Protenix model. Within an acceptable range of performance degradation, it substantially improves computational efficiency. For example, in the case of low-homology single-chain proteins, Protenix-Mini+ experiences an intra-protein LDDT drop of approximately 3% relative to the full Protenix model -- an acceptable performance trade-off given its substantially 90%+ improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adaptive vector steering: A training-free, layer-wise intervention for hallucination mitigation in large audio and multimodal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models and Multi-Modal Large Language Models have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks such as Audio Question Answering (AQA), Audio Captioning, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, there is growing evidence that these models can hallucinate about the content of the audio. To address this issue, we probe the models' internal states and propose Adaptive Vector Steering (AVS), a method that better grounds generation in audio content. We also identify a strong correlation between output correctness and internal representations. Experiments show consistent performance gains across two models and two benchmarks. On the Audio Hallucination QA dataset, our method boosts the F1-score of Gemma from 0.550 to 0.619 and Qwen from 0.626 to 0.632. Furthermore, our method increases the accuracy of Qwen on MMAU from 0.548 to 0.592, marking an 8% relative increase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply vector steering to mitigate hallucination in audio.</description>

      <title>From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.</description>

      <title>SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.</description>

      <title>Toward LLM-Supported Automated Assessment of Critical Thinking Subskills</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills" that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Coupled Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time and Discrete Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of interacting continuous-time Markov chains are a powerful model class, but inference is typically intractable in high dimensional settings. Auxiliary information, such as noisy observations, is typically only available at discrete times, and incorporating it via a Doob's $h-$transform gives rise to an intractable posterior process that requires approximation. We introduce Latent Interacting Particle Systems, a model class parameterizing the generator of each Markov chain in the system. Our inference method involves estimating look-ahead functions (twist potentials) that anticipate future information, for which we introduce an efficient parameterization. We incorporate this approximation in a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a challenging posterior inference task for a latent SIRS model on a graph, and on a neural model for wildfire spread dynamics trained on real data.</description>

      <title>Who's Asking? Evaluating LLM Robustness to Inquiry Personas in Factual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully, grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise, or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for robustness evaluation.</description>

      <title>HyWA: Hypernetwork Weight Adapting Personalized Voice Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) systems activate only in response to a specific target speaker by incorporating speaker embeddings from enrollment utterances. Unlike existing methods that require architectural changes, such as FiLM layers, our approach employs a hypernetwork to modify the weights of a few selected layers within a standard voice activity detection (VAD) model. This enables speaker conditioning without changing the VAD architecture, allowing the same VAD model to adapt to different speakers by updating only a small subset of the layers. We propose HyWA-PVAD, a hypernetwork weight adaptation method, and evaluate it against multiple baseline conditioning techniques. Our comparison shows consistent improvements in PVAD performance. HyWA also offers practical advantages for deployment by preserving the core VAD architecture. Our new approach improves the current conditioning techniques in two ways: i) increases the mean average precision, ii) simplifies deployment by reusing the same VAD architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF) data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena (namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However, they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges, and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every topological level through independent random components. Motivated by applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Biometrics for Automatic Detection of User Familiarity in VR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) devices become increasingly integrated into everyday settings, a growing number of users without prior experience will engage with VR systems. Automatically detecting a user's familiarity with VR as an interaction medium enables real-time, adaptive training and interface adjustments, minimizing user frustration and improving task performance. In this study, we explore the automatic detection of VR familiarity by analyzing hand movement patterns during a passcode-based door-opening task, which is a well-known interaction in collaborative virtual environments such as meeting rooms, offices, and healthcare spaces. While novice users may lack prior VR experience, they are likely to be familiar with analogous real-world tasks involving keypad entry. We conducted a pilot study with 26 participants, evenly split between experienced and inexperienced VR users, who performed tasks using both controller-based and hand-tracking interactions. Our approach uses state-of-the-art deep classifiers for automatic VR familiarity detection, achieving the highest accuracies of 92.05% and 83.42% for hand-tracking and controller-based interactions, respectively. In the cross-device evaluation, where classifiers trained on controller data were tested using hand-tracking data, the model achieved an accuracy of 78.89%. The integration of both modalities in the mixed-device evaluation obtained an accuracy of 94.19%. Our results underline the promise of using hand movement biometrics for the real-time detection of user familiarity in critical VR applications, paving the way for personalized and adaptive VR experiences.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Visual Fatigue Detection Using Eye Gaze Patterns in VR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prolonged exposure to virtual reality (VR) systems leads to visual fatigue, impairs user comfort, performance, and safety, particularly in high-stakes or long-duration applications. Existing fatigue detection approaches rely on subjective questionnaires or intrusive physiological signals, such as EEG, heart rate, or eye-blink count, which limit their scalability and real-time applicability. This paper introduces a deep learning-based study for detecting visual fatigue using continuous eye-gaze trajectories recorded in VR. We use the GazeBaseVR dataset comprising binocular eye-tracking data from 407 participants across five immersive tasks, extract cyclopean eye-gaze angles, and evaluate six deep classifiers. Our results demonstrate that EKYT achieves up to 94% accuracy, particularly in tasks demanding high visual attention, such as video viewing and text reading. We further analyze gaze variance and subjective fatigue measures, indicating significant behavioral differences between fatigued and non-fatigued conditions. These findings establish eye-gaze dynamics as a reliable and nonintrusive modality for continuous fatigue detection in immersive VR, offering practical implications for adaptive human-computer interactions.</description>

      <title>From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation, yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving"; distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention.</description>

      <title>Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.</description>

      <title>Conformal Inference for Open-Set and Imbalanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a conformal prediction method for classification in highly imbalanced and open-set settings, where there are many possible classes and not all may be represented in the data. Existing approaches require a finite, known label space and typically involve random sample splitting, which works well when there is a sufficient number of observations from each class. Consequently, they have two limitations: (i) they fail to provide adequate coverage when encountering new labels at test time, and (ii) they may become overly conservative when predicting previously seen labels. To obtain valid prediction sets in the presence of unseen labels, we compute and integrate into our predictions a new family of conformal p-values that can test whether a new data point belongs to a previously unseen class. We study these p-values theoretically, establishing their optimality, and uncover an intriguing connection with the classical Good--Turing estimator for the probability of observing a new species. To make more efficient use of imbalanced data, we also develop a selective sample splitting algorithm that partitions training and calibration data based on label frequency, leading to more informative predictions. Despite breaking exchangeability, this allows maintaining finite-sample guarantees through suitable re-weighting. With both simulated and real data, we demonstrate our method leads to prediction sets with valid coverage even in challenging open-set scenarios with infinite numbers of possible labels, and produces more informative predictions under extreme class imbalance.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

      <title>True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability: Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes. Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing experiments.</description>

      <title>GatePro: Parameter-Free Expert Selection Optimization for Mixture-of-Experts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Multi-dimensional Semantic Surprise Framework Based on Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds for Fine-Grained Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy. To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks, reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Certified Unlearning in High Dimensions: A Hypothesis Testing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to efficiently remove the influence of selected data while preserving generalization. Significant progress has been made in low dimensions $(p \ll n)$, but high dimensions pose serious theoretical challenges as standard optimization assumptions of $\Omega(1)$ strong convexity and $O(1)$ smoothness of the per-example loss $f$ rarely hold simultaneously in proportional regimes $(p\sim n)$. In this work, we introduce $\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability, a canonical and robust notion well-suited to high-dimensional regimes, that optimally captures a broad class of noise adding mechanisms. Then we theoretically analyze the performance of a widely used unlearning algorithm based on one step of the Newton method in the high-dimensional setting described above. Our analysis shows that a single Newton step, followed by a well-calibrated Gaussian noise, is sufficient to achieve both privacy and accuracy in this setting. This result stands in sharp contrast to the only prior work that analyzes machine unlearning in high dimensions \citet{zou2025certified}, which relaxes some of the standard optimization assumptions for high-dimensional applicability, but operates under the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability. That work concludes %that a single Newton step is insufficient even for removing a single data point, and that at least two steps are required to ensure both privacy and accuracy. Our result leads us to conclude that the discrepancy in the number of steps arises because of the sub optimality of the notion of $\varepsilon$-certifiability and its incompatibility with noise adding mechanisms, which $\varepsilon$-Gaussian certifiability is able to overcome optimally.</description>

      <title>ESI: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification via Semantic-preserving Intervention for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>D-com: Accelerating Iterative Processing to Enable Low-rank Decomposition of Activations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation and memory costs of large language models kept increasing over last decade, which reached over the scale of 1T parameters. To address the challenges from the large scale models, model compression techniques such as low-rank decomposition have been explored. Previous model decomposition works have focused on weight decomposition to avoid costly runtime decomposition, whose latency often significantly exceeds the benefits from decomposition (e.g., 38% more end-to-end latency when running Llama2-7b on A100 with 4K sequence length with activation decomposition compared to no decomposition). In this work, we debunk such observations and report that the input decomposition can be significantly beneficial with a proper choice of decomposition algorithm and hardware support. We adopt progressive decomposition algorithm, Lanczos algorithm, and design a co-accelerator architecture for the decomposition algorithm. To address the memory- boundness of the decomposition operation, we introduce a novel compute replication methodology that moves the op- eration toward compute-bound region, which enables 6.2x speedup in our evaluation. We also develop an output shape- preserving computation scheme that eliminates decomposi- tion costs in consecutive layers. To compensate model quality loss from compression, we introduce a multi-track decom- position approach that separately handles outlier channels for high accuracy and low perplexity with minimal compu- tational costs. Combined together, our accelerator, D-com, provides 22% end-to-end latency improvements compared to A100 GPU at the cost of small model quality degradation (e.g., 3% on AI2 Reasoning Challenge task).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches, inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust, transparent, and reliable peer-review system.</description>

      <title>LLM-guided Hierarchical Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex, multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy, context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline. Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.</description>

      <title>Sample-Centric Multi-Task Learning for Detection and Segmentation of Industrial Surface Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC) must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and, at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.</description>

      <title>Altruistic Ride Sharing: A Community-Driven Approach to Short-Distance Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban mobility faces persistent challenges of congestion and fuel consumption, specifically when people choose a private, point-to-point commute option. Profit-driven ride-sharing platforms prioritize revenue over fairness and sustainability. This paper introduces Altruistic Ride-Sharing (ARS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer mobility framework where participants alternate between driver and rider roles based on altruism points rather than monetary incentives. The system integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MADDPG) for dynamic ride-matching, game-theoretic equilibrium guarantees for fairness, and a population model to sustain long-term balance. Using real-world New York City taxi data, we demonstrate that ARS reduces travel distance and emissions, increases vehicle utilization, and promotes equitable participation compared to both no-sharing and optimization-based baselines. These results establish ARS as a scalable, community-driven alternative to conventional ride-sharing, aligning individual behavior with collective urban sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic Adversarial Attack and Defense for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation.

      <title>Automated Network Protocol Testing with LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network protocol testing is fundamental for modern network infrastructure. However, traditional network protocol testing methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, requiring manual interpretation of specifications, test case design, and translation into executable artifacts, typically demanding one person-day of effort per test case. Existing model-based approaches provide partial automation but still involve substantial manual modeling and expert intervention, leading to high costs and limited adaptability to diverse and evolving protocols. In this paper, we propose a first-of-its-kind system called NeTestLLM that takes advantage of multi-agent Large Language Models (LLMs) for end-to-end automated network protocol testing. NeTestLLM employs hierarchical protocol understanding to capture complex specifications, iterative test case generation to improve coverage, a task-specific workflow for executable artifact generation, and runtime feedback analysis for debugging and refinement. NeTestLLM has been deployed in a production environment for several months, receiving positive feedback from domain experts. In experiments, NeTestLLM generated 4,632 test cases for OSPF, RIP, and BGP, covering 41 historical FRRouting bugs compared to 11 by current national standards. The process of generating executable artifacts also improves testing efficiency by a factor of 8.65x compared to manual methods. NeTestLLM provides the first practical LLM-powered solution for automated end-to-end testing of heterogeneous network protocols.</description>

      <title>Two Heads Are Better Than One: Audio-Visual Speech Error Correction with Dual Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER) framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework, DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR hypotheses at https://github.com/sungnyun/dualhyp.</description>

      <title>AOAD-MAT: Transformer-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model considering agents' order of action decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</description>

      <title>Improving Visual Recommendation on E-commerce Platforms Using Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically, we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment. In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by 50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>F-BFQ: Flexible Block Floating-Point Quantization Accelerator for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prominent for daily tasks, from improving sound-totext translation to generating additional frames for the latest video games. With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a non-asymptotic analysis of the contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, a training method for unnormalized models. While prior work has established that (for exponential family distributions) the CD iterates asymptotically converge at an $O(n^{-1 / 3})$ rate to the true parameter of the data distribution, we show, under some regularity assumptions, that CD can achieve the parametric rate $O(n^{-1 / 2})$. Our analysis provides results for various data batching schemes, including the fully online and minibatch ones. We additionally show that CD can be near-optimal, in the sense that its asymptotic variance is close to the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.</description>

      <title>Steerable Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.</description>

      <title>Robust Minimax Boosting with Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boosting methods often achieve excellent classification accuracy, but can experience notable performance degradation in the presence of label noise. Existing robust methods for boosting provide theoretical robustness guarantees for certain types of label noise, and can exhibit only moderate performance degradation. However, previous theoretical results do not account for realistic types of noise and finite training sizes, and existing robust methods can provide unsatisfactory accuracies, even without noise. This paper presents methods for robust minimax boosting (RMBoost) that minimize worst-case error probabilities and are robust to general types of label noise. In addition, we provide finite-sample performance guarantees for RMBoost with respect to the error obtained without noise and with respect to the best possible error (Bayes risk). The experimental results corroborate that RMBoost is not only resilient to label noise but can also provide strong classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis -- Improving Algorithms and Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a 2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still, PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach. Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values. Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally, this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a new algorithm.</description>

      <title>ExpressNet-MoE: A Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential. Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77% on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings. Reproducible codes and results are made publicly accessible at https://github.com/DeeptimaanB/ExpressNet-MoE.</description>

      <title>Narrow Operator Models of Stellarator Equilibria in Fourier Zernike Basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical computation of the ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium magnetic field is at the base of stellarator optimisation and provides the starting point for solving more sophisticated Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) like transport or turbulence models. Conventional approaches solve for a single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.</description>

      <title>Data-driven learning of feedback maps for explicit robust predictive control: an approximation theoretic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an algorithm to learn feedback maps from data for a class of robust model predictive control (MPC) problems. The algorithm accounts for the approximation errors due to the learning directly at the synthesis stage, ensuring recursive feasibility by construction. The optimal control problem consists of a linear noisy dynamical system, a quadratic stage and quadratic terminal costs as the objective, and convex constraints on the state, control, and disturbance sequences; the control minimizes and the disturbance maximizes the objective. We proceed via two steps -- (a) Data generation: First, we reformulate the given minmax problem into a convex semi-infinite program and employ recently developed tools to solve it in an exact fashion on grid points of the state space to generate (state, action) data. (b) Learning approximate feedback maps: We employ a couple of approximation schemes that furnish tight approximations within preassigned uniform error bounds on the admissible state space to learn the unknown feedback policy. The stability of the closed-loop system under the approximate feedback policies is also guaranteed under a standard set of hypotheses. Two benchmark numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</description>

We demonstrate that if we have access to the distribution of a structural causal model, and additional data from only two environments that sufficiently differ in the noise statistics, the unique causal graph is identifiable. Notably, this is the first result in the literature that guarantees the entire causal graph recovery with a constant number of environments and arbitrary nonlinear mechanisms. Our only constraint is the Gaussianity of the noise terms; however, we propose potential ways to relax this requirement. Of interest on its own, we expand on the well-known duality between independent component analysis (ICA) and causal discovery; recent advancements have shown that nonlinear ICA can be solved from multiple environments, at least as many as the number of sources: we show that the same can be achieved for causal discovery while having access to much less auxiliary information.</description>

      <title>NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).</description>

      <title>Unlocking Public Catalogues: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for ICD Coding of German Tumor Diagnoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Rescheduling in Prefill-Decode Disaggregated LLM Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference has emerged as a fundamental paradigm. In real-world scenarios, variations in output length cause severe workload imbalance in the decode phase, particularly for long-output reasoning tasks. Existing systems, such as PD disaggregation architectures, rely on static prefill-to-decode scheduling, which often results in SLO violations and OOM failures under evolving decode workloads.
  In this paper, we propose ARES, an adaptive decoding rescheduling system powered by length prediction to anticipate future workloads. Our core contributions include: (1) A lightweight and continuous LLM-native prediction method that leverages LLM hidden state to model remaining generation length with high precision (reducing MAE by 49.42%) and low overhead (cutting predictor parameters by 93.28%); (2) A rescheduling solution in decode phase with : A dynamic balancing mechanism that integrates current and predicted workloads, reducing P99 TPOT by 74.77% and achieving up to 2.24 times higher goodput.</description>

      <title>CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.</description>

      <title>Seeing and Knowing in the Wild: Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition with Large-scale Knowledge Graphs via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.</description>

      <title>On Pretraining for Project-Level Code Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repository-level pretraining is commonly used to enable large language models for code to leverage codebase-wide context. This enhances their ability to generate accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we investigate how different repository-processing strategies affect in-context learning in OpenCoder, a 1.5B-parameter model. We extend its context window from 4,096 to 16,384 tokens by training on additional 1B tokens of curated repository-level data. Despite relying on a smaller dataset than competing models (which often use hundreds of billions of tokens), our model achieves comparable performance on the Long Code Arena benchmark. We find that various repository-processing techniques yield similarly strong results, with the primary gain coming from adapting to a new rotary positional embedding (RoPE) scaling parameter. Finally, we show that a simpler file-level training approach at the original sequence length remains highly effective, opening up repository-level code completion research to settings with more constrained data and compute resources.</description>

      <title>Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans</title>

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.</description>

      <title>Dedelayed: Deleting remote inference delay via on-device correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms. Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain aligned with the current world state.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale High-Resolution Logarithmic Grapher Module for Efficient Vision GNNs</title>

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Tyler's M-Estimator for Elliptical Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem in statistics is estimating the shape matrix of an Elliptical distribution. This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian covariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal estimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural M-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime, independent of the underlying distribution. Numerical experiments show that this estimator performs very well, and that Tyler's iterative procedure converges quickly to the estimator. Franks and Moitra recently provided the first distribution-free error bounds in the finite sample setting, as well as the first rigorous convergence analysis of Tyler's iterative procedure. However, their results exceed the sample complexity of the Gaussian setting by a $\log^{2} d$ factor. We close this gap by proving optimal sample threshold and error bounds for Tyler's M-estimator for all Elliptical distributions, fully matching the Gaussian result. Moreover, we recover the algorithmic convergence even at this lower sample threshold. Our approach builds on the operator scaling connection of Franks and Moitra by introducing a novel pseudorandom condition, which we call $\infty$-expansion. We show that Elliptical distributions satisfy $\infty$-expansion at the optimal sample threshold, and then prove a novel scaling result for inputs satisfying this condition.</description>

      <title>RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.</description>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks for edge computing. Neuromorphic computing can significantly reduce energy requirements. Here, we present a complete pipeline: efficient event-based training of SNNs with synaptic delays on GPUs and deployment on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and Loihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster and uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.</description>

      <title>PriorGuide: Test-Time Prior Adaptation for Simulation-Based Inference</title>

Abstract: Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience, increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs. However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained inference models.</description>

      <title>NoisePrints: Distortion-Free Watermarks for Authorship in Private Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation, proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access to model weights.</description>

      <title>When to Trust Your Simulator: Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13464v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning effective reinforcement learning (RL) policies to solve real-world complex tasks can be quite challenging without a high-fidelity simulation environment. In most cases, we are only given imperfect simulators with simplified dynamics, which inevitably lead to severe sim-to-real gaps in RL policy learning. The recently emerged field of offline RL provides another possibility to learn policies directly from pre-collected historical data. However, to achieve reasonable performance, existing offline RL algorithms need impractically large offline data with sufficient state-action space coverage for training. This brings up a new question: is it possible to combine learning from limited real data in offline RL and unrestricted exploration through imperfect simulators in online RL to address the drawbacks of both approaches? In this study, we propose the Dynamics-Aware Hybrid Offline-and-Online Reinforcement Learning (H2O) framework to provide an affirmative answer to this question. H2O introduces a dynamics-aware policy evaluation scheme, which adaptively penalizes the Q function learning on simulated state-action pairs with large dynamics gaps, while also simultaneously allowing learning from a fixed real-world dataset. Through extensive simulation and real-world tasks, as well as theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of H2O against other cross-domain online and offline RL algorithms. H2O provides a brand new hybrid offline-and-online RL paradigm, which can potentially shed light on future RL algorithm design for solving practical real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>Normalised clustering accuracy: An asymmetric external cluster validity measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02935v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no, nor will there ever be, single best clustering algorithm. Nevertheless, we would still like to be able to distinguish between methods that work well on certain task types and those that systematically underperform. Clustering algorithms are traditionally evaluated using either internal or external validity measures. Internal measures quantify different aspects of the obtained partitions, e.g., the average degree of cluster compactness or point separability. However, their validity is questionable because the clusterings they endorse can sometimes be meaningless. External measures, on the other hand, compare the algorithms' outputs to fixed ground truth groupings provided by experts. In this paper, we argue that the commonly used classical partition similarity scores, such as the normalised mutual information, Fowlkes-Mallows, or adjusted Rand index, miss some desirable properties. In particular, they do not identify worst-case scenarios correctly, nor are they easily interpretable. As a consequence, the evaluation of clustering algorithms on diverse benchmark datasets can be difficult. To remedy these issues, we propose and analyse a new measure: a version of the optimal set-matching accuracy, which is normalised, monotonic with respect to some similarity relation, scale-invariant, and corrected for the imbalancedness of cluster sizes (but neither symmetric nor adjusted for chance).</description>

      <title>Improving Transferability of Adversarial Examples via Bayesian Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples allows for the attack on unknown deep neural networks (DNNs), posing a serious threat to many applications and attracting great attention. In this paper, we improve the transferability of adversarial examples by incorporating the Bayesian formulation into both the model parameters and model input, enabling their joint diversification. We demonstrate that combination of Bayesian formulations for both the model input and model parameters yields significant improvements in transferability. By introducing advanced approximations of the posterior distribution over the model input, adversarial transferability achieves further enhancement, surpassing all state-of-the-arts when attacking without model fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a principled approach to fine-tune model parameters within this Bayesian framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in transfer-based attacks, significantly improving the average success rate on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

Abstract: Graph unlearning emerges as a crucial advancement in the pursuit of responsible AI, providing the means to remove sensitive data traces from trained models, thereby upholding the \textit{right to be forgotten}. It is evident that graph machine learning exhibits sensitivity to data privacy and adversarial attacks, necessitating the application of graph unlearning techniques to address these concerns effectively. In this comprehensive survey paper, we present the first systematic review of graph unlearning approaches, encompassing a diverse array of methodologies and offering a detailed taxonomy and up-to-date literature overview to facilitate the understanding of researchers new to this field. To ensure clarity, we provide lucid explanations of the fundamental concepts and evaluation measures used in graph unlearning, catering to a broader audience with varying levels of expertise. Delving into potential applications, we explore the versatility of graph unlearning across various domains, including but not limited to social networks, adversarial settings, recommender systems, and resource-constrained environments like the Internet of Things, illustrating its potential impact in safeguarding data privacy and enhancing AI systems' robustness. Finally, we shed light on promising research directions, encouraging further progress and innovation within the domain of graph unlearning. By laying a solid foundation and fostering continued progress, this survey seeks to inspire researchers to further advance the field of graph unlearning, thereby instilling confidence in the ethical growth of AI systems and reinforcing the responsible application of machine learning techniques in various domains.</description>

      <title>Thinking in Groups: Permutation Tests Reveal Near-Out-of-Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have the potential to power many biomedical workflows, but training them on truly representative, IID datasets is often infeasible. Most models instead rely on biased or incomplete data, making them prone to out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs that closely resemble in-distribution samples. Such near-OoD cases are harder to detect than standard OOD benchmarks and can cause unreliable, even catastrophic, predictions. Biomedical assays, however, offer a unique opportunity: they often generate multiple correlated measurements per specimen through biological or technical replicates. Exploiting this insight, we introduce Homogeneous OoD (HOoD), a novel OoD detection framework for correlated data. HOoD projects groups of correlated measurements through a trained model and uses permutation-based hypothesis tests to compare them with known subpopulations. Each test yields an interpretable p-value, quantifying how well a group matches a subpopulation. By aggregating these p-values, HOoD reliably identifies OoD groups. In evaluations, HOoD consistently outperforms point-wise and ensemble-based OoD detectors, demonstrating its promise for robust real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16843v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</description>

Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, this survey proposes a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between and within instances. Additionally, it categorizes data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Exact Gauss-Newton (EGN), a stochastic second-order optimization algorithm that combines the generalized Gauss-Newton (GN) Hessian approximation with low-rank linear algebra to compute the descent direction. Leveraging the Duncan-Guttman matrix identity, the parameter update is obtained by factorizing a matrix which has the size of the mini-batch. This is particularly advantageous for large-scale machine learning problems where the dimension of the neural network parameter vector is several orders of magnitude larger than the batch size. Additionally, we show how improvements such as line search, adaptive regularization, and momentum can be seamlessly added to EGN to further accelerate the algorithm. Moreover, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm converges in expectation to a stationary point of the objective. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate that EGN consistently exceeds, or at most matches the generalization performance of well-tuned SGD, Adam, GAF, SQN, and SGN optimizers across various supervised and reinforcement learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Hallucination Rate of Generative AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07457v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating the hallucination rate for in-context learning (ICL) with generative AI. In ICL, a conditional generative model (CGM) is prompted with a dataset and a prediction question and asked to generate a response. One interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes the posterior predictive of an unknown Bayesian model, which implicitly defines a joint distribution over observable datasets and latent mechanisms. This joint distribution factorizes into two components: the model prior over mechanisms and the model likelihood of datasets given a mechanism. With this perspective, we define a hallucination as a generated response to the prediction question with low model likelihood given the mechanism. We develop a new method that takes an ICL problem and estimates the probability that a CGM will generate a hallucination. Our method only requires generating prediction questions and responses from the CGM and evaluating its response log probability. We empirically evaluate our method using large language models for synthetic regression and natural language ICL tasks.</description>

      <title>Can DPO Learn Diverse Human Values? A Theoretical Scaling Law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03459v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. An essential part of ensuring that LLMs are aligned for all people is accounting for a diverse set of values. This paper introduces a new theoretical framework to analyze how generalization scales with value diversity and sample quantity in models trained with direct preference optimization. Our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we provide a bound on the generalization error that demonstrates the challenges of effectively learning a wide set of concepts or values. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theory.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Structured State Space Models Can Be Poisoned With Clean Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are powered by an implicit bias: a tendency of gradient descent to fit training data in a way that generalizes to unseen data. A recent class of neural network models gaining increasing popularity is structured state space models (SSMs), regarded as an efficient alternative to transformers. Prior work argued that the implicit bias of SSMs leads to generalization in a setting where data is generated by a low dimensional teacher. In this paper, we revisit the latter setting, and formally establish a phenomenon entirely undetected by prior work on the implicit bias of SSMs. Namely, we prove that while implicit bias leads to generalization under many choices of training data, there exist special examples whose inclusion in training completely distorts the implicit bias, to a point where generalization fails. This failure occurs despite the special training examples being labeled by the teacher, i.e. having clean labels! We empirically demonstrate the phenomenon, with SSMs trained independently and as part of non-linear neural networks. In the area of adversarial machine learning, disrupting generalization with cleanly labeled training examples is known as clean-label poisoning. Given the proliferation of SSMs, we believe that delineating their susceptibility to clean-label poisoning, and developing methods for overcoming this susceptibility, are critical research directions to pursue.</description>

      <title>Are High-Degree Representations Really Unnecessary in Equivariant Graph Neural Networks?</title>

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that incorporate E(3) symmetry have achieved significant success in various scientific applications. As one of the most successful models, EGNN leverages a simple scalarization technique to perform equivariant message passing over only Cartesian vectors (i.e., 1st-degree steerable vectors), enjoying greater efficiency and efficacy compared to equivariant GNNs using higher-degree steerable vectors. This success suggests that higher-degree representations might be unnecessary. In this paper, we disprove this hypothesis by exploring the expressivity of equivariant GNNs on symmetric structures, including $k$-fold rotations and regular polyhedra. We theoretically demonstrate that equivariant GNNs will always degenerate to a zero function if the degree of the output representations is fixed to 1 or other specific values. Based on this theoretical insight, we propose HEGNN, a high-degree version of EGNN to increase the expressivity by incorporating high-degree steerable vectors while maintaining EGNN's efficiency through the scalarization trick. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HEGNN not only aligns with our theoretical analyses on toy datasets consisting of symmetric structures, but also shows substantial improvements on more complicated datasets such as $N$-body and MD17. Our theoretical findings and empirical results potentially open up new possibilities for the research of equivariant GNNs.</description>

      <title>On the Limits of Language Generation: Trade-Offs Between Hallucination and Mode Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Specifying all desirable properties of a language model is challenging, but certain requirements seem essential. Given samples from an unknown language, the trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be expressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise, outputting invalid strings constitutes "hallucination," and failing to capture the full range leads to "mode collapse." We ask if a language model can meet both requirements.
  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building on Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a distribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite collection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say the model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size increases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.
  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in language generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class of language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible for most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s result, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any countable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with breadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.
  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples needed for generation with or without breadth.
  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is achievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples (strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones. This suggests that post-training feedback, which encodes negative examples, can be crucial in reducing hallucinations while limiting mode collapse.</description>

      <title>SoundnessBench: A Soundness Benchmark for Neural Network Verifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) verification aims to formally verify properties of NNs, which is crucial for ensuring the behavior of NN-based models in safety-critical applications. In recent years, the community has developed many NN verifiers and benchmarks to evaluate them. However, existing benchmarks typically lack ground-truth for hard instances where no current verifier can verify the property and no counterexample can be found. This makes it difficult to validate the soundness of a verifier, when it claims verification on such challenging instances that no other verifier can handle. In this work, we develop a new benchmark for NN verification, named "SoundnessBench", specifically for testing the soundness of NN verifiers. SoundnessBench consists of instances with deliberately inserted counterexamples that are hidden from adversarial attacks commonly used to find counterexamples. Thereby, it can identify false verification claims when hidden counterexamples are known to exist. We design a training method to produce NNs with hidden counterexamples and systematically construct our SoundnessBench with instances across various model architectures, activation functions, and input data. We demonstrate that our training effectively produces hidden counterexamples and our SoundnessBench successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVP-Harry/SoundnessBench and our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoundnessBench/SoundnessBench.</description>

      <title>CSI-BERT2: A BERT-inspired Framework for Efficient CSI Prediction and Classification in Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, built on CSI-BERT, which adapts BERT to capture the complex relationships among CSI sequences through a bidirectional self-attention mechanism. We introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. To further enhance the representation capacity of CSI data, we modify the structure of the original CSI-BERT. We introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based temporal embedding module to mitigate temporal information loss problem inherent in the original Transformer.Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CSI-BERT2 .</description>

      <title>Constructing Confidence Intervals for Average Treatment Effects from Multiple Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for the average treatment effect (ATE) from patient records is crucial to assess the effectiveness and safety of drugs. However, patient records typically come from different hospitals, thus raising the question of how multiple observational datasets can be effectively combined for this purpose. In our paper, we propose a new method that estimates the ATE from multiple observational datasets and provides valid CIs. Our method makes little assumptions about the observational datasets and is thus widely applicable in medical practice. The key idea of our method is that we leverage prediction-powered inferences and thereby essentially `shrink' the CIs so that we offer more precise uncertainty quantification as compared to na\"ive approaches. We further prove the unbiasedness of our method and the validity of our CIs. We confirm our theoretical results through various numerical experiments. Finally, we provide an extension of our method for constructing CIs from combinations of experimental and observational datasets.</description>

      <title>BoxingGym: Benchmarking Progress in Automated Experimental Design and Model Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the world and explaining it with scientific theories is a central aspiration of artificial intelligence research. Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and then revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLM's ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a benchmark with 10 environments for systematically evaluating both experimental design (e.g. collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g. proposing and revising scientific theories). To enable tractable and quantitative evaluation, we implement each environment as a generative probabilistic model with which a scientific agent can run interactive experiments. These probabilistic models are drawn from various real-world scientific domains ranging from psychology to ecology. To quantitatively evaluate a scientific agent's ability to collect informative experimental data, we compute the expected information gain (EIG), an information-theoretic quantity which measures how much an experiment reduces uncertainty about the parameters of a generative model. A good scientific theory is a concise and predictive explanation. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate model discovery, we ask a scientific agent to explain their model and then assess whether this explanation enables another scientific agent to make reliable predictions about this environment. In addition to this explanation-based evaluation, we compute standard model evaluation metrics such as prediction errors. We find that current LLMs, such as GPT-4o, struggle with both experimental design and model discovery. We find that augmenting the LLM-based agent with an explicit statistical model does not reliably improve these results.</description>

      <title>NEUROLOGIC: From Neural Representations to Interpretable Logic Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rule-based explanation methods offer rigorous and globally interpretable insights into neural network behavior. However, existing approaches are mostly limited to small fully connected networks and depend on costly layerwise rule extraction and substitution processes. These limitations hinder their generalization to more complex architectures such as Transformers. Moreover, existing methods produce shallow, decision-tree-like rules that fail to capture rich, high-level abstractions in complex domains like computer vision and natural language processing. To address these challenges, we propose NEUROLOGIC, a novel framework that extracts interpretable logical rules directly from deep neural networks. Unlike previous methods, NEUROLOGIC can construct logic rules over hidden predicates derived from neural representations at any chosen layer, in contrast to costly layerwise extraction and rewriting. This flexibility enables broader architectural compatibility and improved scalability. Furthermore, NEUROLOGIC supports richer logical constructs and can incorporate human prior knowledge to ground hidden predicates back to the input space, enhancing interpretability. We validate NEUROLOGIC on Transformer-based sentiment analysis, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful, interpretable logic rules and provide deeper insights-tasks where existing methods struggle to scale.</description>

      <title>Constrained belief updates explain geometric structures in transformer representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What computational structures emerge in transformers trained on next-token prediction? In this work, we provide evidence that transformers implement constrained Bayesian belief updating -- a parallelized version of partial Bayesian inference shaped by architectural constraints. We integrate the model-agnostic theory of optimal prediction with mechanistic interpretability to analyze transformers trained on a tractable family of hidden Markov models that generate rich geometric patterns in neural activations. Our primary analysis focuses on single-layer transformers, revealing how the first attention layer implements these constrained updates, with extensions to multi-layer architectures demonstrating how subsequent layers refine these representations. We find that attention carries out an algorithm with a natural interpretation in the probability simplex, and create representations with distinctive geometric structure. We show how both the algorithmic behavior and the underlying geometry of these representations can be theoretically predicted in detail -- including the attention pattern, OV-vectors, and embedding vectors -- by modifying the equations for optimal future token predictions to account for the architectural constraints of attention. Our approach provides a principled lens on how architectural constraints shape the implementation of optimal prediction, revealing why transformers develop specific intermediate geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Quantize What Counts: More for Keys, Less for Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer inference-time memory bottlenecks dominated by the attention Key-Value (KV) cache, which scales with model size and context length. While KV-cache quantization alleviates this cost, bit allocation between keys and values is often tuned heuristically, lacking theoretical grounding and generalizability. This paper proposes two theorems that anchor mixed-precision KV quantization in the intrinsic geometry of Transformer models. First, key projections systematically have larger spectral and Frobenius norms than value matrices, implying higher information density along the key path. Second, for any given memory budget, prioritizing precision for keys over values strictly reduces quantization error and better preserves accuracy. Empirical evaluations across various prominent LLMs and benchmarks show that key-favored allocations (e.g., 4-bit keys, 2-bit values) retain up to 98.3\% accuracy compared to uniform allocations (e.g., 4-bit for both), while conserving memory. These results transform bit allocation from ad hoc tuning into a theoretically grounded, geometry-driven design principle for efficient LLM inference.

      <title>Random Scaling for Emergent Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models famously improve under a smooth scaling law, but some specific capabilities exhibit sudden breakthroughs in performance. While advocates of "emergence" view breakthroughs as unlocked capabilities, others attribute them to thresholding effects on noncontinuous metrics. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. In synthetic length generalization tasks, we show that different random seeds can produce either highly linear or emergent scaling trends. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. In a case study of inverse scaling, we show that even as the probability of a successful run declines, the average performance of a successful run increases monotonically. We validate our distributional scaling framework on realistic settings by measuring MMLU performance in LM populations. Our observations hold true even under continuous loss metrics, confirming that random variation must be considered when predicting a model's performance from its scale.</description>

      <title>T\'yr-the-Pruner: Structural Pruning LLMs via Global Sparsity Distribution Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural pruning enhances hardware-agnostic inference efficiency for large language models (LLMs) yet often fails to maintain comparable performance. Local pruning performs efficient layer-by-layer compression but ignores global topology. Although global pruning aims to identify an optimal sparse model, intuitive methods typically adopt a two-stage paradigm that first evaluates substructure saliency and then applies global pruning, which ignores inter-structure dependencies and fails to achieve end-to-end optimization. To address these limitations, we propose T\'yr-the-Pruner, an efficient end-to-end search-based global structural pruning framework. This framework constructs a supernet by repeatedly applying local pruning across a range of sparsity ratios to each layer in an LLM, with the core goal of determining the optimal sparsity distribution under a target overall sparsity ratio. Concretely, we introduce an effective local pruning and an expectation error accumulation approach to improve supernet construction. Furthermore, we employ an iterative prune-and-search strategy with coarse-to-fine sparsity granularity to ensure efficient search convergence. Experimental results show that T\'yr-the-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art structural pruning, retaining 97% of the dense model's performance while removing a challenging 50% of Llama-3.1-70B's parameters. Code will be available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Tyr-the-Pruner.</description>

      <title>A metrological framework for uncertainty evaluation in machine learning classification models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for nominal properties. This framework is based on probability mass functions and summary statistics thereof, and it is applicable to ML classification. We also illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing number of satellites and orbital debris has made space congestion a critical issue, threatening satellite safety and sustainability. Challenges such as collision avoidance, station-keeping, and orbital maneuvering require advanced techniques to handle dynamic uncertainties and multi-agent interactions. Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in this domain, enabling adaptive, autonomous policies for space operations; however, many existing RL frameworks rely on custom-built environments developed from scratch, which often use simplified models and require significant time to implement and validate the orbital dynamics, limiting their ability to fully capture real-world complexities. To address this, we introduce OrbitZoo, a versatile multi-agent RL environment built on a high-fidelity industry standard library, that enables realistic data generation, supports scenarios like collision avoidance and cooperative maneuvers, and ensures robust and accurate orbital dynamics. The environment is validated against a real satellite constellation, Starlink, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.16% compared to real-world data. This validation ensures reliability for generating high-fidelity simulations and enabling autonomous and independent satellite operations.</description>

Naturally formulated as a multivariate time series forecasting problem, it attracts substantial research efforts. Traditional mean regression methods for time series forecasting cannot capture the data complexity adequately, resulting in deteriorated performance in operational tasks in DTNs such as routing. This paper formulates the prediction of QoS metrics in DTN as a probabilistic forecasting problem on multivariate time series, where one could quantify the uncertainty of forecasts by characterizing the distribution of these samples. The proposed approach hires diffusion models and incorporates the latent temporal dynamics of non-stationary and multi-mode data into them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by showing that it outperforms the popular probabilistic time series forecasting methods.</description>

      <title>Intelligent4DSE: Optimizing High-Level Synthesis Design Space Exploration with Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) Design Space Exploration (DSE) is essential for generating hardware designs that balance performance, power, and area (PPA). To optimize this process, existing works often employs message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to predict quality of results (QoR). These predictors serve as evaluators in the DSE process, effectively bypassing the time-consuming estimations traditionally required by HLS tools. However, existing models based on MPNNs struggle with over-smoothing and limited expressiveness. Additionally, while meta-heuristic algorithms are widely used in DSE, they typically require extensive domain-specific knowledge to design operators and time-consuming tuning. To address these limitations, we propose ECoGNNs-LLMMHs, a framework that integrates graph neural networks with task-adaptive message passing and large language model-enhanced meta-heuristic algorithms. Compared with state-of-the-art works, ECoGNN exhibits lower prediction error in the post-HLS prediction task, with the error reduced by 57.27\%. For post-implementation prediction tasks, ECoGNN demonstrates the lowest prediction errors, with average reductions of 17.6\% for flip-flop (FF) usage, 33.7\% for critical path (CP) delay, 26.3\% for power consumption, 38.3\% for digital signal processor (DSP) utilization, and 40.8\% for BRAM usage. LLMMH variants can generate superior Pareto fronts compared to meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of average distance from the reference set (ADRS) with average improvements of 87.47\%, respectively. Compared with the SOTA DSE approaches GNN-DSE and IRONMAN-PRO, LLMMH can reduce the ADRS by 68.17\% and 63.07\% respectively.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal data modeling has emerged as a powerful approach in clinical research, enabling the integration of diverse data types such as imaging, genomics, wearable sensors, and electronic health records. Despite its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and support personalized care, modeling such heterogeneous data presents significant technical challenges. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 69 studies to identify common obstacles, including missing modalities, limited sample sizes, dimensionality imbalance, interpretability issues, and finding the optimal fusion techniques. We highlight recent methodological advances, such as transfer learning, generative models, attention mechanisms, and neural architecture search that offer promising solutions. By mapping current trends and innovations, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the field and offers practical insights to guide future research and development in multimodal modeling for medical applications.</description>

      <title>Learning to Think: Information-Theoretic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in their reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Of Mice and Machines: A Comparison of Learning Between Real World Mice and RL Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex decision-making tasks. This progress raises a natural question: how do these artificial systems compare to biological agents, which have been shaped by millions of years of evolution? To help answer this question, we undertake a comparative study of biological mice and RL agents in a predator-avoidance maze environment. Through this analysis, we identify a striking disparity: RL agents consistently demonstrate a lack of self-preservation instinct, readily risking ``death'' for marginal efficiency gains. These risk-taking strategies are in contrast to biological agents, which exhibit sophisticated risk-assessment and avoidance behaviors. Towards bridging this gap between the biological and artificial, we propose two novel mechanisms that encourage more naturalistic risk-avoidance behaviors in RL agents. Our approach leads to the emergence of naturalistic behaviors, including strategic environment assessment, cautious path planning, and predator avoidance patterns that closely mirror those observed in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Flattening Hierarchies with Policy Bootstrapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</description>

      <title>The quest for the GRAph Level autoEncoder (GRALE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training, but its effectiveness is often limited by client data heterogeneity. We introduce a client-selection algorithm that (i) dynamically forms nonoverlapping coalitions of clients based on asymptotic agreement and (ii) selects one representative from each coalition to minimize the variance of model updates. Our approach is inspired by social-network modeling, leveraging homophily-based proximity matrices for spectral clustering and techniques for identifying the most informative individuals to estimate a group's aggregate opinion. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for the algorithm under mild, standard FL assumptions. Finally, we validate our approach by benchmarking it against three strong heterogeneity-aware baselines; the results show higher accuracy and faster convergence, indicating that the framework is both theoretically grounded and effective in practice.</description>

      <title>Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Decentralizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Causal Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL (DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints, communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly expedite the learning process in DMARL.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prediction of SO(3)-Equivariant Hamiltonian Matrices via SO(2) Local Frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library https://github.com/divelab/AIRS.</description>

      <title>Self-Predictive Representations for Combinatorial Generalization in Behavioral Cloning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally correlated states are properly encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. We formalize this notion by demonstrating how encouraging long-range temporal consistency via successor representations (SR) can facilitate generalization. We then propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ for GCBC, which theoretically approximates the successor representation in the finite MDP case through self-predictive representations, and achieves competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.</description>

      <title>Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-IMM, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://github.com/blacksnail789521/IMM-TSF.

      <title>Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners: Modular Reasoning with Brain-Like Specialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human cognitive behavior arises from the interaction of specialized brain networks dedicated to distinct functions, such as language, logic, and social reasoning. Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.</description>

      <title>LazyEviction: Lagged KV Eviction with Attention Pattern Observation for Efficient Long Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit enhanced capabilities by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. However, the extended reasoning sequences introduce significant GPU memory overhead due to increased key-value (KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods mitigate memory bottlenecks but struggle in long reasoning tasks. In this paper, we analyze attention patterns in reasoning tasks and reveal a Token Importance Recurrence phenomenon: a large proportion of tokens regain high attention after multiple decoding steps, which is failed to capture by existing works and may lead to unpredictable eviction on such periodically critical tokens. To address this, we propose LazyEviction, an observation window-based lagged eviction framework retaining latent recurring tokens by prioritized eviction based on tokens' recurrence patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LazyEviction reduces KV cache by 50%~70% while maintaining comparable accuracy, outperforming existing KV cache compression baselines.

      <title>A Brain-to-Population Graph Learning Framework for Diagnosing Brain Disorders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developed graph-based methods for diagnosing brain disorders using functional connectivity highly rely on predefined brain atlases, but overlook the rich information embedded within atlases and the confounding effects of site and phenotype variability. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage Brain-to-Population Graph Learning (B2P-GL) framework that integrates the semantic similarity of brain regions and condition-based population graph modeling. In the first stage, termed brain representation learning, we leverage brain atlas knowledge from GPT-4 to enrich the graph representation and refine the brain graph through an adaptive node reassignment graph attention network. In the second stage, termed population disorder diagnosis, phenotypic data is incorporated into population graph construction and feature fusion to mitigate confounding effects and enhance diagnosis performance. Experiments on the ABIDE I, ADHD-200, and Rest-meta-MDD datasets show that B2P-GL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy while enhancing interpretability. Overall, our proposed framework offers a reliable and personalized approach to brain disorder diagnosis, advancing clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Finetuning Made Scalable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in the Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.</description>

      <title>DynaSearcher: Dynamic Knowledge Graph Augmented Search Agent via Multi-Reward Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-step agentic retrieval systems based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex information search tasks. However, these systems still face significant challenges in practical applications, particularly in generating factually inconsistent intermediate queries and inefficient search trajectories, which can lead to reasoning deviations or redundant computations. To address these issues, we propose DynaSearcher, an innovative search agent enhanced by dynamic knowledge graphs and multi-reward reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, our system leverages knowledge graphs as external structured knowledge to guide the search process by explicitly modeling entity relationships, thereby ensuring factual consistency in intermediate queries and mitigating biases from irrelevant information. Furthermore, we employ a multi-reward RL framework for fine-grained control over training objectives such as retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and response quality. This framework promotes the generation of high-quality intermediate queries and comprehensive final answers, while discouraging unnecessary exploration and minimizing information omissions or redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art answer accuracy on six multi-hop question answering datasets, matching frontier LLMs while using only small-scale models and limited computational resources. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness across diverse retrieval environments and larger-scale models, highlighting its broad applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one structure, one function paradigm, yet many critical biological processes - from enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple conformational states. Existing multi-state design approaches rely on post-hoc aggregation of single-state predictions, achieving poor experimental success rates compared to single-state design. We introduce DynamicMPNN, an inverse folding model explicitly trained to generate sequences compatible with multiple conformations through joint learning across conformational ensembles. Trained on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated using Alphafold 3, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 25% on decoy-normalized RMSD and by 12% on sequence recovery across our challenging multi-state protein benchmark.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rank Adjustment for Accurate and Efficient Neural Network Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Fast Low-rank Attention Routing Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks. We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research. Our code is available at https://github.com/vpuri3/FLARE.py.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Evaluation Function: A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand forecasting in competitive and uncertain business environments requires models that can integrate multiple evaluation perspectives, rather than being restricted to hyperparameter optimization through a single metric. This traditional approach tends to prioritize one error indicator, which can bias results when metrics provide contradictory signals. In this context, the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF) is proposed as a multi-metric framework for hyperparameter optimization that integrates explanatory power (R2), sensitivity to extreme errors (RMSE), and average accuracy (MAE). The performance of HEF was assessed using four widely recognized benchmark datasets in the forecasting domain: the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets. Prediction models were optimized through Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and statistical analyses based on difference-of-proportions tests confirmed that HEF delivers superior results compared to a unimetric reference function, regardless of the optimizer employed, with particular relevance for heterogeneous monthly time series (M3) and highly granular daily demand scenarios (M5). The findings demonstrate that HEF improves stability, generalization, and robustness at a low computational cost, consolidating its role as a reliable evaluation framework that enhances model selection, enables more accurate demand forecasts, and supports decision-making in dynamic and competitive business environments.</description>

      <title>MACTAS: Self-Attention-Based Module for Inter-Agent Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents. Experimental results on the SMAC and SMACv2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of maps.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving LLMs via Continual Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18133v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.</description>

      <title>CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20712v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</description>

      <title>Learning Equivariant Functions via Quadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown) equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$ corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms, while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple. This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges, and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target. When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m &gt; d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads.</description>

      <title>Functional Critic Modeling for Provably Convergent Off-Policy Actor-Critic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Fidel-TS: A High-Fidelity Benchmark for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress. Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in multimodal forecasting.</description>

      <title>Learning Inter-Atomic Potentials without Explicit Equivariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Inference Engines based on Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00133v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks (SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs, using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1) replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA), (2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.</description>

      <title>How Well Can Preference Optimization Generalize Under Noisy Feedback?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization: mini-critics boost LLM reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach for training large language models (LLMs) with stronger reasoning abilities. It has also been applied to a variety of logic puzzles. In this work, we study the Korean word-chain game using RLVR. We show that rule-derived rewards can naturally conflict, and demonstrate through experiments that a curriculum-learning scheme mitigates these conflicts. Our findings motivate further studies of puzzle tasks in diverse languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains, spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Meets Adversarial Robustness via Constrained Interventions on LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a \emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a \emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead. Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions, while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>HybridFlow: Quantification of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty with a Single Hybrid Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring robustness in high-stakes machine learning applications. We introduce HybridFlow, a modular hybrid architecture that unifies the modeling of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by combining a Conditional Masked Autoregressive normalizing flow for estimating aleatoric uncertainty with a flexible probabilistic predictor for epistemic uncertainty. The framework supports integration with any probabilistic model class, allowing users to easily adapt HybridFlow to existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.</description>

      <title>Function regression using the forward forward training and inferring paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.</description>

      <title>h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization: Entropy Is Controllable in Reinforcement Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.</description>

      <title>Rademacher Meets Colors: More Expressivity, but at What Cost ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity -- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power often comes at the cost of generalization.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Retrosynthesis: Eliminating Hallucinations with a Diverse Ensemble of Reaction Scorers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs (hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled retrosynthetic intermediates. This approach formed the basis of our winning solution to the Standard Industries \$1 million Retrosynthesis Challenge. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain. By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol, we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport: each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows, which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered objective with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.</description>

      <title>Mamba Can Learn Low-Dimensional Targets In-Context via Test-Time Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples. Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Teleconnections with Physics-Informed Graph Attention Networks for Long-Range Extreme Rainfall Forecasting in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water management.</description>

      <title>Convergence and sample complexity of natural policy gradient primal-dual methods for constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sequential decision making problem of maximizing the expected total reward while satisfying a constraint on the expected total utility. We employ the natural policy gradient method to solve the discounted infinite-horizon optimal control problem for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (constrained MDPs). Specifically, we propose a new Natural Policy Gradient Primal-Dual (NPG-PD) method that updates the primal variable via natural policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected subgradient descent. Although the underlying maximization involves a nonconcave objective function and a nonconvex constraint set, under the softmax policy parametrization, we prove that our method achieves global convergence with sublinear rates regarding both the optimality gap and the constraint violation. Such convergence is independent of the size of the state-action space, i.e., it is~dimension-free. Furthermore, for log-linear and general smooth policy parametrizations, we establish sublinear convergence rates up to a function approximation error caused by restricted policy parametrization. We also provide convergence and finite-sample complexity guarantees for two sample-based NPG-PD algorithms. We use a set of computational experiments to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Latent-Domain Predictive Neural Speech Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural audio/speech coding has recently demonstrated its capability to deliver high quality at much lower bitrates than traditional methods. However, existing neural audio/speech codecs employ either acoustic features or learned blind features with a convolutional neural network for encoding, by which there are still temporal redundancies within encoded features. This paper introduces latent-domain predictive coding into the VQ-VAE framework to fully remove such redundancies and proposes the TF-Codec for low-latency neural speech coding in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the extracted features are encoded conditioned on a prediction from past quantized latent frames so that temporal correlations are further removed. Moreover, we introduce a learnable compression on the time-frequency input to adaptively adjust the attention paid to main frequencies and details at different bitrates. A differentiable vector quantization scheme based on distance-to-soft mapping and Gumbel-Softmax is proposed to better model the latent distributions with rate constraint. Subjective results on multilingual speech datasets show that, with low latency, the proposed TF-Codec at 1 kbps achieves significantly better quality than Opus at 9 kbps, and TF-Codec at 3 kbps outperforms both EVS at 9.6 kbps and Opus at 12 kbps. Numerous studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques. Code and models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/TF-Codec.</description>

      <title>Clustering with minimum spanning trees: How good can it be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) provide a convenient representation of datasets in numerous pattern recognition activities. Moreover, they are relatively fast to compute. In this paper, we quantify the extent to which they are meaningful in low-dimensional partitional data clustering tasks. By identifying the upper bounds for the agreement between the best (oracle) algorithm and the expert labels from a large battery of benchmark data, we discover that MST methods can be very competitive. Next, we review, study, extend, and generalise a few existing, state-of-the-art MST-based partitioning schemes. This leads to some new noteworthy approaches. Overall, the Genie and the information-theoretic methods often outperform the non-MST algorithms such as K-means, Gaussian mixtures, spectral clustering, Birch, density-based, and classical hierarchical agglomerative procedures. Nevertheless, we identify that there is still some room for improvement, and thus the development of novel algorithms is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Learning Power Flow with Confidence: A Probabilistic Guarantee Framework for Voltage Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of formal performance guarantees in machine learning (ML) has limited its adoption for safety-critical power system applications, where confidence and interpretability are as vital as accuracy. In this work, we present a probabilistic guarantee for power flow learning and voltage risk estimation, derived through the framework of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Specifically, we establish a bound on the expected estimation error that connects the GP's predictive variance to confidence in voltage risk estimates, ensuring statistical equivalence with Monte Carlo-based ACPF risk quantification. To enhance model learnability in the low-data regime, we first design the Vertex-Degree Kernel (VDK), a topology-aware additive kernel that decomposes voltage-load interactions into local neighborhoods for efficient large-scale learning. Building on this, we introduce a network-swipe active learning (AL) algorithm that adaptively samples informative operating points and provides a principled stopping criterion without requiring out-of-sample validation. Together, these developments mitigate the principal bottleneck of ML-based power flow-its lack of guaranteed reliability-by combining data efficiency with analytical assurance. Empirical evaluations across IEEE 118-, 500-, and 1354-bus systems confirm that the proposed VDK-GP achieves mean absolute voltage errors below 1E-03 p.u., reproduces Monte Carlo-level voltage risk estimates with 15x fewer ACPF computations, and achieves over 120x reduction in evaluation time while conservatively bounding violation probabilities.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Latent Automated Program Repair Capabilities of Large Language Models using Round-Trip Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research shows that errors in natural language can be corrected by translating texts to another language and back using language models. We explore to what extent this latent correction capability extends to Automated Program Repair (APR) by investigating Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translating code from one programming language into another programming or natural language and back, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We hypothesize that RTT restores patterns most commonly seen in the LLM's training corpora through regression toward the mean, replacing infrequent bugs with more frequent, natural, bug-free code. To test this hypothesis, we employ nine LLMs and four common APR benchmarks in Java, and perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of RTT-generated patches. We find that RTT through English generates plausible patches for 100 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java benchmark, and 97 are found to be correct in our manual assessment. Moreover, RTT uniquely generates plausible patches for 46 bugs that were missed by LLMs specifically fine-tuned for APR. While this demonstrates the viability of RTT for APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than the state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the impact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a complementary component in APR frameworks. A replication package is available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10500593.

      <title>Leveraging Nested MLMC for Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation with Intractable Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in studying sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques due to their advantages for simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. The methods aim to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As an SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs well and scales to high-dimensional data. However, the APT method requires computing the expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic proposals were used to render an analytical normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we reformulate APT as a nested estimation problem. Building on this, we construct several multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for the loss function and its gradients to accommodate different scenarios, including two unbiased estimators, and a biased estimator that trades a small bias for reduced variance and controlled runtime and memory usage. We also provide convergence results of stochastic gradient descent to quantify the interaction of the bias and variance of the gradient estimator. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodality in moderate dimensions are provided to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>NewVEM: A Newton Vertex Exchange Method for a Class of Constrained Self-Concordant Minimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose \textbf{NewVEM}, a Newton vertex exchange method for efficiently solving self-concordant minimization problems under generalized simplex constraints. The algorithm features a two-level structure: the outer loop employs a projected Newton method, and the inner loop uses a vertex exchange approach to solve strongly convex quadratic subproblems. Both loops converge locally at linear rates under technical conditions, resulting in a ``fast $\times$ fast'' framework that demonstrates high efficiency and scalability in practice. To get a feasible initial point to execute the algorithm, we also present and analyze a highly efficient semismooth Newton method for computing the projection onto the generalized simplex. The excellent practical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by a set of numerical experiments. Our results further motivate the potential real-world applications of the considered model and the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Steady Continuous Monitoring is (Just Barely) Impossible for Tests of Unbounded Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AB testing evaluates the difference between a control and a treatment in a statistically rigorous manner. Continuous monitoring allows statistical evaluation of an AB test as it proceeds. One goal of continuous monitoring is early stopping -- confirming a statistically significant difference between control and treatment as soon as possible. Another goal is to maintain some statistical capability to discover significant differences later in the test if they cannot be confirmed earlier. These goals are in conflict -- looser requirements for early stopping leave us with more stringent ones for later. This paper shows that it is impossible to maintain a constant requirement for significance for tests that have no a priori stopping time, but we can come arbitrarily close to that goal by using tests that require repeated significant results to con rm statistically significant differences between treatment and control.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for performing lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This quantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main component of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed of loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and rate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be able to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product. Specifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is applied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per entry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate matrix product $A^\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower bound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate $R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically, we construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit guarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$ in terms of only Frobenius norms $\|\bar{A}\|_F, \|\bar{B}\|_F$ and $\|\bar{A}^\top \bar{B}\|_F$, where $\bar{A},\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$ with zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our quantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A practical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite close to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix multiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition at $R\approx 0.906$ bit/entry, showing necessity of Johnson-Lindestrauss dimensionality reduction (sketching) in the low-rate regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification for causal effects is crucial in various applications, but remains difficult in nonparametric models, particularly for continuous treatments. We introduce IMPspec, a Gaussian process (GP) framework for modeling uncertainty over interventional causal functions under continuous treatments, which can be represented using reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). By using principled function class expansions and a spectral representation of RKHS features, IMPspec yields tractable training and inference, a spectral algorithm to calibrate posterior credible intervals, and avoids the underfitting and variance collapse pathologies of earlier GP-on-RKHS methods. Across synthetic benchmarks and an application in healthcare, IMPspec delivers state-of-the-art performance in causal uncertainty quantification and downstream causal Bayesian optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. Our method defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate our method's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse image and video datasets. Remarkably, we surpass previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. This growth, however, is accompanied by significant security risks such as illicit accounts engaged in fraud. Effective detection is further limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious accounts. To address these challenges with a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem, we propose $\textbf{SLEID}$, a $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{L}$earning $\textbf{E}$nsemble-based $\textbf{I}$llicit account $\textbf{D}$etection framework. SLEID uses an Isolation Forest model for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, enhancing detection accuracy. Experiments on 6,903,860 Ethereum transactions with extensive DeFi interaction coverage demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines with $\textbf{+2.56}$ percentage-point precision, comparable recall, and $\textbf{+0.90}$ percentage-point F1 -- particularly for the minority illicit class -- alongside $\textbf{+3.74}$ percentage-points higher accuracy and improvements in PR-AUC, while substantially reducing reliance on labeled data.</description>

      <title>Hydraulis: Balancing Large Transformer Model Training via Co-designing Parallel Strategies and Data Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To optimize large Transformer model training, both efficient parallel computing and advanced data management are indispensable. However, current methods often assume a stable and uniform training workload, neglecting data-induced imbalances-arising from both sampling and packing processes-which can impede training performance. Specifically, data sampling imbalance arises from uneven sequence length distribution of the training data, while data packing imbalance stems from the discrepancy between the linear memory complexity and quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism. To address these imbalance issues, we develop Hydraulis, which jointly optimizes the parallel strategies and data assignment. For one thing, we introduce large model training with dynamic heterogeneous parallel strategies in response to the sequence length variations within and across training iterations. For another, we devise a two-stage data assignment approach, which strikes a good balance in terms of the training workloads both within and across model replicas. Empirical results demonstrate that Hydraulis outperforms existing systems by 1.32-2.66 times.</description>

      <title>The Value of AI Advice: Personalized and Value-Maximizing AI Advisors Are Necessary to Reliably Benefit Experts and Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite advances in AI's performance and interpretability, AI advisors can undermine experts' decisions and increase the time and effort experts must invest to make decisions. Consequently, AI systems deployed in high-stakes settings often fail to consistently add value across experts and organizations and can even diminish the value that experts alone provide. Beyond harm in specific domains, such outcomes impede progress in research and practice, underscoring the need to understand when and why different AI advisors add or diminish value. To bridge this gap, we stress the importance of assessing the value AI advice brings to real-world contexts when designing and evaluating AI advisors. Building on this perspective, we characterize key pillars -- pathways through which AI advice impacts value -- and develop a framework that incorporates these pillars to create reliable, personalized, and value-adding advisors. Our results highlight the need for value-driven development of AI advisors that advise selectively, are tailored to experts' unique behaviors, and are optimized for context-specific trade-offs between decision improvements and advising costs. They also reveal how the lack of inclusion of these pillars in the design of AI advising systems may be contributing to the failures observed in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Personalized Data-Driven Generative Model of Human Repetitive Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of autonomous virtual avatars (in extended reality) and robots in human group activities -- such as rehabilitation therapy, sports, and manufacturing -- is expected to increase as these technologies become more pervasive. Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. Furthermore, recent research has shown that each person exhibits a unique velocity signature, highlighting how individual motor behaviors are both rich in variability and internally consistent. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior, hindering the development of effective cognitive architectures. In this work, we first show that motion amplitude provides a valid and complementary characterization of individual motor signatures. Then, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on long short-term memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique features of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real human data from participants performing spontaneous oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that state-of-the-art Kuramoto-like models fail to replicate individual motor signatures, whereas our model accurately reproduces the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, while remaining distinct from others.</description>

      <title>ChA-MAEViT: Unifying Channel-Aware Masked Autoencoders and Multi-Channel Vision Transformers for Improved Cross-Channel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

      <title>Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.</description>

      <title>IterMask3D: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Segmentation with Test-Time Iterative Mask Refinement in 3D Brain MR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as `normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as `anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods
  corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned `normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose $\rm{IterMask3D}$, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks `normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of `normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

      <title>Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of labelled data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a natural metric for comparing conditional distributions. We then derive a consistent estimator for the AMCMD and establish its rate of convergence. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Building on this, we extend the idea of KH to develop Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm that constructs a compressed set targeting the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), a straightforward adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression (via JKH and JKIP) and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</description>

      <title>Statistical post-processing yields accurate probabilistic forecasts from Artificial Intelligence weather models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning for Data Collection Scheduling in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being utilized in various private and commercial applications, e.g., traffic control, parcel delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-Assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and, especially, in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sampling efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies, such as SAR missions. In this paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL)-Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) system is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects sensory data and transmits it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which creates a task description in natural language. From this description, the UAV receives a data collection schedule that must be executed. A verifier ensures safe UAV operations by evaluating the schedules generated by the LLM and overriding unsafe schedules based on predefined rules. The system continuously adapts by incorporating feedback into the task descriptions and using this for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where the task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC significantly reduces cumulative packet loss compared to both the DQN and Maximum Channel Gain baselines. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UASNETs.</description>

      <title>Teaching Models to Understand (but not Generate) High-risk Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content -- such as toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve the learned structure of the flow.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Natural Gradient Descent for PINNs with Randomized Nystr\"om Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) has emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for training neural network-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs), such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of solving linear systems involving the Gramian matrix. While matrix-free NGD methods based on the conjugate gradient (CG) method avoid explicit matrix inversion, the ill-conditioning of the Gramian significantly slows the convergence of CG. In this work, we extend matrix-free NGD to broader classes of problems than previously considered and propose the use of Randomized Nystr\"om preconditioning to accelerate convergence of the inner CG solver. The resulting algorithm demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing NGD-based methods and other state-of-the-art optimizers on a range of PDE problems discretized using neural networks.</description>

      <title>BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenTSLab/BrainOmni.</description>

      <title>Non-convex entropic mean-field optimization via Best Response flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which ensures the existence of its unique fixed point that is then shown to be the unique global minimizer for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.</description>

      <title>Joint Denoising of Cryo-EM Projection Images using Polar Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many imaging modalities involve reconstruction of unknown objects from collections of noisy projections related by random rotations. In one of these modalities, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) makes integration of information from multiple images crucial. Existing approaches to cryo-EM processing, however, either rely on handcrafted priors or apply deep learning only on select portions of the pipeline, such as particle picking, micrograph denoising, or refinement. A fully end-to-end reconstruction approach requires a neural network architecture that integrates information from multiple images while respecting the rotational symmetry of the measurement process. In this work, we introduce the polar transformer, a new neural network architecture that combines polar representations and transformers along with a convolutional attention mechanism that preserves the rotational symmetry of the problem. We apply it to the particle-level denoising problem, where it is able to learn discriminative features in the images, enabling optimal clustering, alignment, and denoising. On simulated datasets, this achieves up to a $2\times$ reduction in mean squared error (MSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $0.02$, suggesting new opportunities for data-driven approaches to reconstruction in cryo-EM and related tomographic modalities.</description>

      <title>LLM Probability Concentration: How Alignment Shrinks the Generative Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs) often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this consistency in the generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this concentration, we introduce the *Branching Factor* (BF)--a token-invariant measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude (e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies. Building on this insight, we find this consistency has surprising implications for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g., DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic (lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., ``Sure'') that unlock low-entropy trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by nudging experiments, which show prompting base models with such tokens can similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how base models can be steered away from diversity.</description>

      <title>Stable Minima of ReLU Neural Networks Suffer from the Curse of Dimensionality: The Neural Shattering Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flatness / low (loss) curvature and its effects on generalization in two-layer overparameterized ReLU networks with multivariate inputs -- a problem well motivated by the minima stability and edge-of-stability phenomena in gradient-descent training. Existing work either requires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper presents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate inputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and (2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable minima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness does imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily deteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an exponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\`a-vis low-norm solutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a novel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat solutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely activate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in high dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first systematic explanation for why flat minima may fail to generalize in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>When Less Is More: Binary Feedback Can Outperform Ordinal Comparisons in Ranking Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Early Signs of Steganographic Capabilities in Frontier LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations. In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography: passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given additional affordances like using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes, including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities. While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed monitors at present, this could change in the future.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in randomized trials leveraging external data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects but often lack the statistical power to uncover individual-level treatment effect heterogeneity, limiting their value for personalized decision-making. To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational studies. The proposed method is robust: it can reduce the mean squared error relative to a trial-only CATE learner, and is guaranteed to recover the true CATE even when the external data are not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it asymptotically matches or exceeds both component learners in terms of mean squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal LLM: Reasoning about Environments and Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs. Code and data are available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.</description>

      <title>Generative Head-Mounted Camera Captures for Photorealistic Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome) for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC), that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect, to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth. Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Double Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models such as deep neural networks which have a re-descending property in their risk function. As the complexity of the model increases, risk exhibits a U-shaped region due to the traditional bias-variance trade-off, then as the number of parameters equals the number of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation where the risk can be unbounded and finally, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the double descent effect. Our goal is to show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation. We also show that this is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor -- simpler models are preferred to complex ones, all else being equal. Our theoretical foundations use Bayesian model selection, the Dickey-Savage density ratio, and connect generalized ridge regression and global-local shrinkage methods with double descent. We illustrate our approach for high dimensional neural networks and provide detailed treatments of infinite Gaussian means models and non-parametric regression. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Approach to Continual Learning: An Overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continual learning is an online paradigm where a learner continually accumulates knowledge from different tasks encountered over sequential time steps. Importantly, the learner is required to extend and update its knowledge without forgetting about the learning experience acquired from the past, and while avoiding the need to retrain from scratch. Given its sequential nature and its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an opportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of widening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world problems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving sequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and Bayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the prior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the knowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings of Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and class-incremental learning. We begin by discussing definitions of continual learning along with its Bayesian setting, as well as the links with related fields, such as domain adaptation, transfer learning and meta-learning. Afterwards, we introduce a taxonomy offering a comprehensive categorization of algorithms belonging to the Bayesian continual learning paradigm. Meanwhile, we analyze the state-of-the-art while zooming in on some of the most prominent Bayesian continual learning algorithms to date. Furthermore, we shed some light on links between continual learning and developmental psychology, and correspondingly introduce analogies between both fields. We follow that with a discussion of current challenges, and finally conclude with potential areas for future research on Bayesian continual learning.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models to Low-Resource Languages through LLM-Based Selective Translation: A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Enabling Few-Shot Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis on Biomarker Data with Tabular LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.</description>

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that, while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to do so.</description>

      <title>TASER: Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449 tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.</description>

      <title>Backpropagation-Free Test-Time Adaptation via Probabilistic Gaussian Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Effect Identification and Unit Categorization in the Multi-Score Regression Discontinuity Design with Application to LED Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RDD (Regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for identifying and estimating causal effects at the cutoff of a single running variable. In practice, however, decision-making often involves multiple thresholds and criteria, especially in production systems. Standard MRD (multi-score RDD) methods address this complexity by reducing the problem to a one-dimensional design. This simplification allows existing approaches to be used to identify and estimate causal effects, but it can introduce non-compliance by misclassifying units relative to the original cutoff rules. We develop theoretical tools to detect and reduce "fuzziness" when estimating the cutoff effect for units that comply with individual subrules of a multi-rule system. In particular, we propose a formal definition and categorization of unit behavior types under multi-dimensional cutoff rules, extending standard classifications of compliers, alwaystakers, and nevertakers, and incorporating defiers and indecisive units. We further identify conditions under which cutoff effects for compliers can be estimated in multiple dimensions, and establish when identification remains valid after excluding nevertakers and alwaystakers. In addition, we examine how decomposing complex Boolean cutoff rules (such as AND- and OR-type rules) into simpler components affects the classification of units into behavioral types and improves estimation by making it possible to identify and remove non-compliant units more accurately. We validate our framework using both semi-synthetic simulations calibrated to production data and real-world data from opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach has practical value in refining production policies and reduces estimation variance. This underscores the usefulness of the MRD framework in manufacturing contexts.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Hindi LLMs: A New Suite of Datasets and a Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) in Hindi is challenging due to a lack of high-quality benchmarks, as direct translation of English datasets fails to capture crucial linguistic and cultural nuances. To address this, we introduce a suite of five Hindi LLM evaluation datasets: IFEval-Hi, MT-Bench-Hi, GSM8K-Hi, ChatRAG-Hi, and BFCL-Hi. These were created using a methodology that combines from-scratch human annotation with a translate-and-verify process. We leverage this suite to conduct an extensive benchmarking of open-source LLMs supporting Hindi, providing a detailed comparative analysis of their current capabilities. Our curation process also serves as a replicable methodology for developing benchmarks in other low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Sparse Polyak: an adaptive step size rule for high-dimensional M-estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study Sparse Polyak, a variant of Polyak's adaptive step size, designed to solve high-dimensional statistical estimation problems where the problem dimension is allowed to grow much faster than the sample size. In such settings, the standard Polyak step size performs poorly, requiring an increasing number of iterations to achieve optimal statistical precision-even when, the problem remains well conditioned and/or the achievable precision itself does not degrade with problem size. We trace this limitation to a mismatch in how smoothness is measured: in high dimensions, it is no longer effective to estimate the Lipschitz smoothness constant. Instead, it is more appropriate to estimate the smoothness restricted to specific directions relevant to the problem (restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant). Sparse Polyak overcomes this issue by modifying the step size to estimate the restricted Lipschitz smoothness constant. We support our approach with both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, demonstrating its improved performance.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guarding Model for Online Malicious Intent Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive applications, online malicious intent detection has become increasingly critical. However, existing approaches fall short of handling diverse and complex user queries in real time. To address these challenges, we introduce ADRAG (Adversarial Distilled Retrieval-Augmented Guard), a two-stage framework for robust and efficient online malicious intent detection. In the training stage, a high-capacity teacher model is trained on adversarially perturbed, retrieval-augmented inputs to learn robust decision boundaries over diverse and complex user queries. In the inference stage, a distillation scheduler transfers the teacher's knowledge into a compact student model, with a continually updated knowledge base collected online. At deployment, the compact student model leverages top-K similar safety exemplars retrieved from the online-updated knowledge base to enable both online and real-time malicious query detection. Evaluations across ten safety benchmarks demonstrate that ADRAG, with a 149M-parameter model, achieves 98.5% of WildGuard-7B's performance, surpasses GPT-4 by 3.3% and Llama-Guard-3-8B by 9.5% on out-of-distribution detection, while simultaneously delivering up to 5.6x lower latency at 300 queries per second (QPS) in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Re-uploading quantum data: A universal function approximator for quantum inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum data re-uploading has proved powerful for classical inputs, where repeatedly encoding features into a small circuit yields universal function approximation. Extending this idea to quantum inputs remains underexplored, as the information contained in a quantum state is not directly accessible in classical form. We propose and analyze a quantum data re-uploading architecture in which a qubit interacts sequentially with fresh copies of an arbitrary input state. The circuit can approximate any bounded continuous function using only one ancilla qubit and single-qubit measurements. By alternating entangling unitaries with mid-circuit resets of the input register, the architecture realizes a discrete cascade of completely positive and trace-preserving maps, analogous to collision models in open quantum system dynamics. Our framework provides a qubit-efficient and expressive approach to designing quantum machine learning models that operate directly on quantum data.</description>

      <title>LibEMER: A novel benchmark and algorithms library for EEG-based Multimodal Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2025ULUIUBUEUMUEUR485384</description>

      <title>Variational Reasoning for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.</description>

      <title>Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>SAGE-Music: Low-Latency Symbolic Music Generation via Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency symbolic music generation is essential for real-time improvisation and human-AI co-creation. Existing transformer-based models, however, face a trade-off between inference speed and musical quality. Traditional acceleration techniques such as embedding pooling significantly degrade quality, while recently proposed Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) methods - though effective on single-track piano data - suffer large performance drops in multi-track settings, as revealed by our analysis. We propose Attribute-Specialized Key-Value Head Sharing (AS-KVHS), adapted to music's structured symbolic representation, achieving about 30% inference speedup with only a negligible (about 0.4%) quality drop in objective evaluations and slight improvements in subjective listening tests. Our main contributions are (1) the first systematic study of BPE's generalizability in multi-track symbolic music, and (2) the introduction of AS-KVHS for low-latency symbolic music generation. Beyond these, we also release SAGE-Music, an open-source benchmark that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models in generation quality.</description>

      <title>Can Prompts Rewind Time for LLMs? Evaluating the Effectiveness of Prompted Knowledge Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/gxx27/time_unlearn.</description>

Abstract: The meteoric rise of AI, with its rapidly expanding market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's. In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true, sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation of assessments, and introduce PeerBench (with its prototype implementation at https://www.peerbench.ai/), a community-governed, proctored evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely trustworthy measures of AI progress.</description>

      <title>Uncolorable Examples: Preventing Unauthorized AI Colorization via Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08979</link>

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.</description>

      <title>Conditional Flow Matching for Bayesian Posterior Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative multivariate posterior sampler via flow matching. It offers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood evaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the joint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport map from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map, enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach is computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based counterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures. Finally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is provided.</description>

      <title>Learning with Incomplete Context: Linear Contextual Bandits with Pretrained Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of large-scale pretrained models has made it feasible to generate predictive or synthetic features at low cost, raising the question of how to incorporate such surrogate predictions into downstream decision-making. We study this problem in the setting of online linear contextual bandits, where contexts may be complex, nonstationary, and only partially observed. In addition to bandit data, we assume access to an auxiliary dataset containing fully observed contexts--common in practice since such data are collected without adaptive interventions. We propose PULSE-UCB, an algorithm that leverages pretrained models trained on the auxiliary data to impute missing features during online decision-making. We establish regret guarantees that decompose into a standard bandit term plus an additional component reflecting pretrained model quality. In the i.i.d. context case with H\"older-smooth missing features, PULSE-UCB achieves near-optimal performance, supported by matching lower bounds. Our results quantify how uncertainty in predicted contexts affects decision quality and how much historical data is needed to improve downstream learning.</description>

      <title>Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.</description>

      <title>$\Delta \mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.</description>

      <title>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.</description>

      <title>EReLiFM: Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning for Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals, enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
