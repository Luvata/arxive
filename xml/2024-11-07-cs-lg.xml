      <title>MADOD: Generalizing OOD Detection to Unseen Domains via G-Invariance Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often face simultaneous covariate and semantic shifts, challenging traditional domain generalization and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods. We introduce Meta-learned Across Domain Out-of-distribution Detection (MADOD), a novel framework designed to address both shifts concurrently. MADOD leverages meta-learning and G-invariance to enhance model generalizability and OOD detection in unseen domains. Our key innovation lies in task construction: we randomly designate in-distribution classes as pseudo-OODs within each meta-learning task, simulating OOD scenarios using existing data. This approach, combined with energy-based regularization, enables the learning of robust, domain-invariant features while calibrating decision boundaries for effective OOD detection. Operating in a test domain-agnostic setting, MADOD eliminates the need for adaptation during inference, making it suitable for scenarios where test data is unavailable. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate MADOD's superior performance in semantic OOD detection across unseen domains, achieving an AUPR improvement of 8.48% to 20.81%, while maintaining competitive in-distribution classification accuracy, representing a significant advancement in handling both covariate and semantic shifts.</description>

      <title>Learning World Models for Unconstrained Goal Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning world models offers a promising avenue for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning with sparse rewards. By allowing agents to plan actions or exploratory goals without direct interaction with the environment, world models enhance exploration efficiency. The quality of a world model hinges on the richness of data stored in the agent's replay buffer, with expectations of reasonable generalization across the state space surrounding recorded trajectories. However, challenges arise in generalizing learned world models to state transitions backward along recorded trajectories or between states across different trajectories, hindering their ability to accurately model real-world dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel goal-directed exploration algorithm, MUN (short for "World Models for Unconstrained Goal Navigation"). This algorithm is capable of modeling state transitions between arbitrary subgoal states in the replay buffer, thereby facilitating the learning of policies to navigate between any "key" states. Experimental results demonstrate that MUN strengthens the reliability of world models and significantly improves the policy's capacity to generalize across new goal settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel drift detection methodology for machine learning (ML) models based on the concept of ''deformation'' in the vector space representation of data. Recognizing that new data can act as forces stretching, compressing, or twisting the geometric relationships learned by a model, we explore various mathematical frameworks to quantify this deformation. We investigate measures such as eigenvalue analysis of covariance matrices to capture global shape changes, local density estimation using kernel density estimation (KDE), and Kullback-Leibler divergence to identify subtle shifts in data concentration. Additionally, we draw inspiration from continuum mechanics by proposing a ''strain tensor'' analogy to capture multi-faceted deformations across different data types. This requires careful estimation of the displacement field, and we delve into strategies ranging from density-based approaches to manifold learning and neural network methods. By continuously monitoring these deformation metrics and correlating them with model performance, we aim to provide a sensitive, interpretable, and adaptable drift detection system capable of distinguishing benign data evolution from true drift, enabling timely interventions and ensuring the reliability of machine learning systems in dynamic environments. Addressing the computational challenges of this methodology, we discuss mitigation strategies like dimensionality reduction, approximate algorithms, and parallelization for real-time and large-scale applications. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on real-world text data, focusing on detecting context shifts in Generative AI. Our results, supported by publicly available code, highlight the benefits of this deformation-based approach in capturing subtle drifts that traditional statistical methods often miss. Furthermore, we present a detailed application example within the healthcare domain, showcasing the methodology's potential in diverse fields. Future work will focus on further improving computational efficiency and exploring additional applications across different ML domains.</description>

      <title>See it, Think it, Sorted: Large Multimodal Models are Few-shot Time Series Anomaly Analyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is becoming increasingly vital due to the rapid growth of time series data across various sectors. Anomalies in web service data, for example, can signal critical incidents such as system failures or server malfunctions, necessitating timely detection and response. However, most existing TSAD methodologies rely heavily on manual feature engineering or require extensive labeled training data, while also offering limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering framework called the Time Series Anomaly Multimodal Analyzer (TAMA), which leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance both the detection and interpretation of anomalies in time series data. By converting time series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA leverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on extensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous experimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides rich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into the nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first open-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type labels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and advancement within this critical field. Ultimately, TAMA not only excels in anomaly detection but also provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the underlying causes of anomalies, pushing TSAD forward through innovative methodologies and insights.</description>

      <title>Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely \emph{harmless Rawlsian fairness}. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Dynamic Neural Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent applications beyond the network edge, coupled with the need for sustainable operation, are driving the seamless integration of deep learning (DL) algorithms into energy-limited, and even energy-harvesting end-devices. However, the stochastic nature of ambient energy sources often results in insufficient harvesting rates, failing to meet the energy requirements for inference and causing significant performance degradation in energy-agnostic systems. To address this problem, we consider an on-device adaptive inference system equipped with an energy-harvester and finite-capacity energy storage. We then allow the device to reduce the run-time execution cost on-demand, by either switching between differently-sized neural networks, referred to as multi-model selection (MMS), or by enabling earlier predictions at intermediate layers, called early exiting (EE). The model to be employed, or the exit point is then dynamically chosen based on the energy storage and harvesting process states. We also study the efficacy of integrating the prediction confidence into the decision-making process. We derive a principled policy with theoretical guarantees for confidence-aware and -agnostic controllers. Moreover, in multi-exit networks, we study the advantages of taking decisions incrementally, exit-by-exit, by designing a lightweight reinforcement learning-based controller. Experimental results show that, as the rate of the ambient energy increases, energy- and confidence-aware control schemes show approximately 5% improvement in accuracy compared to their energy-aware confidence-agnostic counterparts. Incremental approaches achieve even higher accuracy, particularly when the energy storage capacity is limited relative to the energy consumption of the inference model.</description>

      <title>Strongly Topology-preserving GNNs for Brain Graph Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain graph super-resolution (SR) is an under-explored yet highly relevant task in network neuroscience. It circumvents the need for costly and time-consuming medical imaging data collection, preparation, and processing. Current SR methods leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) thanks to their ability to natively handle graph-structured datasets. However, most GNNs perform node feature learning, which presents two significant limitations: (1) they require computationally expensive methods to learn complex node features capable of inferring connectivity strength or edge features, which do not scale to larger graphs; and (2) computations in the node space fail to adequately capture higher-order brain topologies such as cliques and hubs. However, numerous studies have shown that brain graph topology is crucial in identifying the onset and presence of various neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer and Parkinson. Motivated by these challenges and applications, we propose our STP-GSR framework. It is the first graph SR architecture to perform representation learning in higher-order topological space. Specifically, using the primal-dual graph formulation from graph theory, we develop an efficient mapping from the edge space of our low-resolution (LR) brain graphs to the node space of a high-resolution (HR) dual graph. This approach ensures that node-level computations on this dual graph correspond naturally to edge-level learning on our HR brain graphs, thereby enforcing strong topological consistency within our framework. Additionally, our framework is GNN layer agnostic and can easily learn from smaller, scalable GNNs, reducing computational requirements. We comprehensively benchmark our framework across seven key topological measures and observe that it significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods and baselines.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively researched and used in both academia and industry since the rise in popularity of the Transformer model, which demonstrates excellent performance in AI. However, the computational demands of LLMs are immense, and the energy resources required to run them are often limited. For instance, popular models like GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters and a storage requirement of 350 GB, present significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices and embedded systems. These systems often lack the computational capacity to handle such large models. Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model values to a smaller set of discrete values, offers a promising solution by reducing the size of LLMs and accelerating inference. In this research, we provide a comprehensive analysis of quantization techniques within the machine learning field, with a particular focus on their application to LLMs. We begin by exploring the mathematical theory of quantization, followed by a review of common quantization methods and how they are implemented. Furthermore, we examine several prominent quantization methods applied to LLMs, detailing their algorithms and performance outcomes.</description>

      <title>GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose interpretability challenges, especially for non-expert users. Existing GNN explanation methods often yield technical outputs such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, which are not easily understood. Building on recent insights from social science and other Explainable AI (XAI) methods, we propose GraphXAIN, a natural language narrative that explains individual predictions made by GNNs. We present a model-agnostic and explainer-agnostic XAI approach that complements graph explainers by generating GraphXAINs, using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating graph data, individual predictions from GNNs, explanatory subgraphs, and feature importances. We define XAI Narratives and XAI Descriptions, highlighting their distinctions and emphasizing the importance of narrative principles in effective explanations. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach supports graph practitioners and non-expert users, aligning with social science research on explainability and enhancing user understanding and trust in complex GNN models. We demonstrate GraphXAIN's capabilities on a real-world graph dataset, illustrating how its generated narratives can aid understanding compared to traditional graph explainer outputs or other descriptive explanation methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Neural Networks in Large-scale Traffic Incident Analysis with Concurrency Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in reducing road fatalities, the persistently high rate of traffic-related deaths highlights the necessity for improved safety interventions. Leveraging large-scale graph-based nationwide road network data across 49 states in the USA, our study first posits the Concurrency Hypothesis from intuitive observations, suggesting a significant likelihood of incidents occurring at neighboring nodes within the road network. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce two novel metrics, Average Neighbor Crash Density (ANCD) and Average Neighbor Crash Continuity (ANCC), and subsequently employ them in statistical tests to validate the hypothesis rigorously. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Concurrency Prior (CP) method, a powerful approach designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of general Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in semi-supervised traffic incident prediction tasks. Our method allows GNNs to incorporate concurrent incident information, as mentioned in the hypothesis, via tokenization with negligible extra parameters.
  The extensive experiments, utilizing real-world data across states and cities in the USA, demonstrate that integrating CP into 12 state-of-the-art GNN architectures leads to significant improvements, with gains ranging from 3% to 13% in F1 score and 1.3% to 9% in AUC metrics. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/Incident-GNN-CP.</description>

      <title>Pretrained transformer efficiently learns low-dimensional target functions in-context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers can efficiently learn in-context from example demonstrations. Most existing theoretical analyses studied the in-context learning (ICL) ability of transformers for linear function classes, where it is typically shown that the minimizer of the pretraining loss implements one gradient descent step on the least squares objective. However, this simplified linear setting arguably does not demonstrate the statistical efficiency of ICL, since the pretrained transformer does not outperform directly solving linear regression on the test prompt. In this paper, we study ICL of a nonlinear function class via transformer with nonlinear MLP layer: given a class of \textit{single-index} target functions $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sigma_*(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle)$, where the index features $\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a $r$-dimensional subspace, we show that a nonlinear transformer optimized by gradient descent (with a pretraining sample complexity that depends on the \textit{information exponent} of the link functions $\sigma_*$) learns $f_*$ in-context with a prompt length that only depends on the dimension of the distribution of target functions $r$; in contrast, any algorithm that directly learns $f_*$ on test prompt yields a statistical complexity that scales with the ambient dimension $d$. Our result highlights the adaptivity of the pretrained transformer to low-dimensional structures of the function class, which enables sample-efficient ICL that outperforms estimators that only have access to the in-context data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Risk Assessment in Transformers with Loss-at-Risk Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the financial field, precise risk assessment tools are essential for decision-making. Recent studies have challenged the notion that traditional network loss functions like Mean Square Error (MSE) are adequate, especially under extreme risk conditions that can lead to significant losses during market upheavals. Transformers and Transformer-based models are now widely used in financial forecasting according to their outstanding performance in time-series-related predictions. However, these models typically lack sensitivity to extreme risks and often underestimate great financial losses. To address this problem, we introduce a novel loss function, the Loss-at-Risk, which incorporates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) into Transformer models. This integration allows Transformer models to recognize potential extreme losses and further improves their capability to handle high-stakes financial decisions. Moreover, we conduct a series of experiments with highly volatile financial datasets to demonstrate that our Loss-at-Risk function improves the Transformers' risk prediction and management capabilities without compromising their decision-making accuracy or efficiency. The results demonstrate that integrating risk-aware metrics during training enhances the Transformers' risk assessment capabilities while preserving their core strengths in decision-making and reasoning across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Weight Adjusting Deep Q-Networks for Real-Time Environmental Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning has shown excellent performance in generating efficient solutions for complex tasks. However, its efficacy is often limited by static training modes and heavy reliance on vast data from stable environments. To address these shortcomings, this study explores integrating dynamic weight adjustments into Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to enhance their adaptability. We implement these adjustments by modifying the sampling probabilities in the experience replay to make the model focus more on pivotal transitions as indicated by real-time environmental feedback and performance metrics. We design a novel Interactive Dynamic Evaluation Method (IDEM) for DQN that successfully navigates dynamic environments by prioritizing significant transitions based on environmental feedback and learning progress. Additionally, when faced with rapid changes in environmental conditions, IDEM-DQN shows improved performance compared to baseline methods. Our results indicate that under circumstances requiring rapid adaptation, IDEM-DQN can more effectively generalize and stabilize learning. Extensive experiments across various settings confirm that IDEM-DQN outperforms standard DQN models, particularly in environments characterized by frequent and unpredictable changes.</description>

      <title>The Intersectionality Problem for Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A yet unmet challenge in algorithmic fairness is the problem of intersectionality, that is, achieving fairness across the intersection of multiple groups -- and verifying that such fairness has been attained. Because intersectional groups tend to be small, verifying whether a model is fair raises statistical as well as moral-methodological challenges. This paper (1) elucidates the problem of intersectionality in algorithmic fairness, (2) develops desiderata to clarify the challenges underlying the problem and guide the search for potential solutions, (3) illustrates the desiderata and potential solutions by sketching a proposal using simple hypothesis testing, and (4) evaluates, partly empirically, this proposal against the proposed desiderata.</description>

      <title>ViTally Consistent: Scaling Biological Representation Learning for Cell Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Probability Unlearning: Towards Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning--enabling a trained model to forget specific data--is crucial for addressing biased data and adhering to privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)'s "right to be forgotten". Recent works have paid little attention to privacy concerns, leaving the data intended for forgetting vulnerable to membership inference attacks. Moreover, they often come with high computational overhead. In this work, we propose Pseudo-Probability Unlearning (PPU), a novel method that enables models to forget data efficiently and in a privacy-preserving manner. Our method replaces the final-layer output probabilities of the neural network with pseudo-probabilities for the data to be forgotten. These pseudo-probabilities follow either a uniform distribution or align with the model's overall distribution, enhancing privacy and reducing risk of membership inference attacks. Our optimization strategy further refines the predictive probability distributions and updates the model's weights accordingly, ensuring effective forgetting with minimal impact on the model's overall performance. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, our method achieves over 20% improvements in forgetting error compared to the state-of-the-art. Additionally, our method enhances privacy by preventing the forgotten set from being inferred to around random guesses.</description>

      <title>M-CELS: Counterfactual Explanation for Multivariate Time Series Data Guided by Learned Saliency Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, multivariate time series classification has received great attention. Machine learning (ML) models for multivariate time series classification have made significant strides and achieved impressive success in a wide range of applications and tasks. The challenge of many state-of-the-art ML models is a lack of transparency and interpretability. In this work, we introduce M-CELS, a counterfactual explanation model designed to enhance interpretability in multidimensional time series classification tasks. Our experimental validation involves comparing M-CELS with leading state-of-the-art baselines, utilizing seven real-world time-series datasets from the UEA repository. The results demonstrate the superior performance of M-CELS in terms of validity, proximity, and sparsity, reinforcing its effectiveness in providing transparent insights into the decisions of machine learning models applied to multivariate time series data.</description>

      <title>Explanations that reveal all through the definition of encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature attributions attempt to highlight what inputs drive predictive power. Good attributions or explanations are thus those that produce inputs that retain this predictive power; accordingly, evaluations of explanations score their quality of prediction. However, evaluations produce scores better than what appears possible from the values in the explanation for a class of explanations, called encoding explanations. Probing for encoding remains a challenge because there is no general characterization of what gives the extra predictive power. We develop a definition of encoding that identifies this extra predictive power via conditional dependence and show that the definition fits existing examples of encoding. This definition implies, in contrast to encoding explanations, that non-encoding explanations contain all the informative inputs used to produce the explanation, giving them a "what you see is what you get" property, which makes them transparent and simple to use. Next, we prove that existing scores (ROAR, FRESH, EVAL-X) do not rank non-encoding explanations above encoding ones, and develop STRIPE-X which ranks them correctly. After empirically demonstrating the theoretical insights, we use STRIPE-X to uncover encoding in LLM-generated explanations for predicting the sentiment in movie reviews.</description>

      <title>From Twitter to Reasoner: Understand Mobility Travel Modes and Sentiment Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has become an important platform for people to express their opinions towards transportation services and infrastructure, which holds the potential for researchers to gain a deeper understanding of individuals' travel choices, for transportation operators to improve service quality, and for policymakers to regulate mobility services. A significant challenge, however, lies in the unstructured nature of social media data. In other words, textual data like social media is not labeled, and large-scale manual annotations are cost-prohibitive. In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer the mentioned travel modes from social media posts, and reason people's attitudes toward the associated travel mode, without the need for manual annotation. We compare different LLMs along with various prompting engineering methods in light of human assessment and LLM verification. We find that most social media posts manifest negative rather than positive sentiments. We thus identify the contributing factors to these negative posts and, accordingly, propose recommendations to traffic operators and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Fair In-Context Learning via Latent Concept Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging in-context learning (ICL) ability of large language models (LLMs) has prompted their use for predictive tasks in various domains with different types of data facilitated by serialization methods. However, with increasing applications in high-stakes domains, it has been shown that LLMs can inherit social bias and discrimination from their pre-training data. In this work, we investigate this inherent bias in LLMs during in-context learning with tabular data. We focus on an optimal demonstration selection approach that utilizes latent concept variables for resource-efficient task adaptation. We design data augmentation strategies that reduce correlation between predictive outcomes and sensitive variables helping to promote fairness during latent concept learning. We utilize the learned concept and select demonstrations from a training dataset to obtain fair predictions during inference while maintaining model utility. The latent concept variable is learned using a smaller internal LLM and the selected demonstrations can be used for inference with larger external LLMs. We empirically verify that the fair latent variable approach improves fairness results on tabular datasets compared to multiple heuristic demonstration selection methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) maintain consistency in their responses is essential for developing trustworthy multimodal intelligence. However, existing benchmarks include many samples where all MLLMs \textit{exhibit high response uncertainty when encountering misleading information}, requiring even 5-15 response attempts per sample to effectively assess uncertainty. Therefore, we propose a two-stage pipeline: first, we collect MLLMs' responses without misleading information, and then gather misleading ones via specific misleading instructions. By calculating the misleading rate, and capturing both correct-to-incorrect and incorrect-to-correct shifts between the two sets of responses, we can effectively metric the model's response uncertainty. Eventually, we establish a \textbf{\underline{M}}ultimodal \textbf{\underline{U}}ncertainty \textbf{\underline{B}}enchmark (\textbf{MUB}) that employs both explicit and implicit misleading instructions to comprehensively assess the vulnerability of MLLMs across diverse domains. Our experiments reveal that all open-source and close-source MLLMs are highly susceptible to misleading instructions, with an average misleading rate exceeding 86\%. To enhance the robustness of MLLMs, we further fine-tune all open-source MLLMs by incorporating explicit and implicit misleading data, which demonstrates a significant reduction in misleading rates.

      <title>Carbon price fluctuation prediction using blockchain information A new hybrid machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed in carbon price fluctuation prediction. Specifically, a research framework integrating DILATED Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network algorithm is proposed. The advantage of the combined framework is that it can make feature extraction more efficient. Then, based on the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework, the L1 and L2 parameter norm penalty as regularization method is adopted to predict. Referring to the characteristics of high correlation between energy indicator price and blockchain information in previous literature, and we primarily includes indicators related to blockchain information through regularization process. Based on the above methods, this paper uses a dataset containing an amount of data to carry out the carbon price prediction. The experimental results show that the DILATED CNN-LSTM framework is superior to the traditional CNN-LSTM architecture. Blockchain information can effectively predict the price. Since parameter norm penalty as regularization, Ridge Regression (RR) as L2 regularization is better than Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD) as L1 regularization in price forecasting. Thus, the proposed RR-DILATED CNN-LSTM approach can effectively and accurately predict the fluctuation trend of the carbon price. Therefore, the new forecasting methods and theoretical ecology proposed in this study provide a new basis for trend prediction and evaluating digital assets policy represented by the carbon price for both the academia and practitioners.</description>

      <title>Compositional simulation-based inference for time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortized simulation-based inference (SBI) methods train neural networks on simulated data to perform Bayesian inference. While this approach avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time-series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI framework that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million dimensions in the data domain.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian explanation of machine learning models based on modes and functional ANOVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most methods in explainable AI (XAI) focus on providing reasons for the prediction of a given set of features. However, we solve an inverse explanation problem, i.e., given the deviation of a label, find the reasons of this deviation. We use a Bayesian framework to recover the ``true'' features, conditioned on the observed label value. We efficiently explain the deviation of a label value from the mode, by identifying and ranking the influential features using the ``distances'' in the ANOVA functional decomposition. We show that the new method is more human-intuitive and robust than methods based on mean values, e.g., SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP values). The extra costs of solving a Bayesian inverse problem are dimension-independent.</description>

      <title>A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively Homogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for parallel positively homogeneous neural networks--a class of neural networks whose input-output map decomposes as the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples of such networks include matrix factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, tensor factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and more. Our general framework is based on linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to a closely related convex optimization problem over prediction functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization analysis in the convex space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and its non-convex counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models ranging from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear networks, two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with the network width.</description>

      <title>New random projections for isotropic kernels using stable spectral distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht [31] introduced the idea of decomposing shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any shift-invariant kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose to decompose spectral kernel distributions as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors. This provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for a very large class of multivariate shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In particular, we show that the spectral densities of all these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. This provides a very simple way to modify existing Random Fourier Features software based on Gaussian kernels to cover a much richer class of multivariate kernels. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based modularized loading protocol for parameter estimation of Bouc-Wen class models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a modularized deep learning-based loading protocol for optimal parameter estimation of Bouc-Wen (BW) class models. The protocol consists of two key components: optimal loading history construction and CNN-based rapid parameter estimation. Each component is decomposed into independent sub-modules tailored to distinct hysteretic behaviors-basic hysteresis, structural degradation, and pinching effect-making the protocol adaptable to diverse hysteresis models. Three independent CNN architectures are developed to capture the path-dependent nature of these hysteretic behaviors. By training these CNN architectures on diverse loading histories, minimal loading sequences, termed \textit{loading history modules}, are identified and then combined to construct an optimal loading history. The three CNN models, trained on the respective loading history modules, serve as rapid parameter estimators. Numerical evaluation of the protocol, including nonlinear time history analysis of a 3-story steel moment frame and fragility curve construction for a 3-story reinforced concrete frame, demonstrates that the proposed protocol significantly reduces total analysis time while maintaining or improving estimation accuracy. The proposed protocol can be extended to other hysteresis models, suggesting a systematic approach for identifying general hysteresis models.</description>

      <title>How much is a noisy image worth? Data Scaling Laws for Ambient Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of generative models depends on the quality of the data they are trained on. Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets is often expensive and sometimes impossible, e.g. in certain scientific applications where there is no access to clean data due to physical or instrumentation constraints. Ambient Diffusion and related frameworks train diffusion models with solely corrupted data (which are usually cheaper to acquire) but ambient models significantly underperform models trained on clean data. We study this phenomenon at scale by training more than $80$ models on data with different corruption levels across three datasets ranging from $30,000$ to $\approx 1.3$M samples. We show that it is impossible, at these sample sizes, to match the performance of models trained on clean data when only training on noisy data. Yet, a combination of a small set of clean data (e.g.~$10\%$ of the total dataset) and a large set of highly noisy data suffices to reach the performance of models trained solely on similar-size datasets of clean data, and in particular to achieve near state-of-the-art performance. We provide theoretical evidence for our findings by developing novel sample complexity bounds for learning from Gaussian Mixtures with heterogeneous variances. Our theoretical model suggests that, for large enough datasets, the effective marginal utility of a noisy sample is exponentially worse than that of a clean sample. Providing a small set of clean samples can significantly reduce the sample size requirements for noisy data, as we also observe in our experiments.</description>

      <title>BrainBits: How Much of the Brain are Generative Reconstruction Methods Using?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When evaluating stimuli reconstruction results it is tempting to assume that higher fidelity text and image generation is due to an improved understanding of the brain or more powerful signal extraction from neural recordings. However, in practice, new reconstruction methods could improve performance for at least three other reasons: learning more about the distribution of stimuli, becoming better at reconstructing text or images in general, or exploiting weaknesses in current image and/or text evaluation metrics. Here we disentangle how much of the reconstruction is due to these other factors vs. productively using the neural recordings. We introduce BrainBits, a method that uses a bottleneck to quantify the amount of signal extracted from neural recordings that is actually necessary to reproduce a method's reconstruction fidelity. We find that it takes surprisingly little information from the brain to produce reconstructions with high fidelity. In these cases, it is clear that the priors of the methods' generative models are so powerful that the outputs they produce extrapolate far beyond the neural signal they decode. Given that reconstructing stimuli can be improved independently by either improving signal extraction from the brain or by building more powerful generative models, improving the latter may fool us into thinking we are improving the former. We propose that methods should report a method-specific random baseline, a reconstruction ceiling, and a curve of performance as a function of bottleneck size, with the ultimate goal of using more of the neural recordings.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Monkeys at Play: Random Augmentations Cheaply Break LLM Safety Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become a critical objective of model developers. In response, a growing body of work has been investigating how safety alignment can be bypassed through various jailbreaking methods, such as adversarial attacks. However, these jailbreak methods can be rather costly or involve a non-trivial amount of creativity and effort, introducing the assumption that malicious users are high-resource or sophisticated. In this paper, we study how simple random augmentations to the input prompt affect safety alignment effectiveness in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama 3 and Qwen 2. We perform an in-depth evaluation of 17 different models and investigate the intersection of safety under random augmentations with multiple dimensions: augmentation type, model size, quantization, fine-tuning-based defenses, and decoding strategies (e.g., sampling temperature). We show that low-resource and unsophisticated attackers, i.e. $\textit{stochastic monkeys}$, can significantly improve their chances of bypassing alignment with just 25 random augmentations per prompt.</description>

      <title>Specialized Foundation Models Struggle to Beat Supervised Baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following its success for vision and text, the "foundation model" (FM) paradigm -- pretraining large models on massive data, then fine-tuning on target tasks -- has rapidly expanded to domains in the sciences, engineering, healthcare, and beyond. Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</description>

      <title>Query-Efficient Adversarial Attack Against Vertical Federated Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) has captured wide attention due to its capability of graph representation learning for graph-structured data. However, the distributed data silos limit the performance of GNN. Vertical federated learning (VFL), an emerging technique to process distributed data, successfully makes GNN possible to handle the distributed graph-structured data. Despite the prosperous development of vertical federated graph learning (VFGL), the robustness of VFGL against the adversarial attack has not been explored yet. Although numerous adversarial attacks against centralized GNNs are proposed, their attack performance is challenged in the VFGL scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the adversarial attack against VFGL. A query-efficient hybrid adversarial attack framework is proposed to significantly improve the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, denoted as NA2, short for Neuron-based Adversarial Attack. Specifically, a malicious client manipulates its local training data to improve its contribution in a stealthy fashion. Then a shadow model is established based on the manipulated data to simulate the behavior of the server model in VFGL. As a result, the shadow model can improve the attack success rate of various centralized attacks with a few queries. Extensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks demonstrate that NA2 improves the performance of the centralized adversarial attacks against VFGL, achieving state-of-the-art performance even under potential adaptive defense where the defender knows the attack method. Additionally, we provide interpretable experiments of the effectiveness of NA2 via sensitive neurons identification and visualization of t-SNE.</description>

      <title>Sparse Orthogonal Parameters Tuning for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning methods based on pre-trained models (PTM) have recently gained attention which adapt to successive downstream tasks without catastrophic forgetting. These methods typically refrain from updating the pre-trained parameters and instead employ additional adapters, prompts, and classifiers. In this paper, we from a novel perspective investigate the benefit of sparse orthogonal parameters for continual learning. We found that merging sparse orthogonality of models learned from multiple streaming tasks has great potential in addressing catastrophic forgetting. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel yet effective method called SoTU (Sparse Orthogonal Parameters TUning). We hypothesize that the effectiveness of SoTU lies in the transformation of knowledge learned from multiple domains into the fusion of orthogonal delta parameters. Experimental evaluations on diverse CL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Notably, SoTU achieves optimal feature representation for streaming data without necessitating complex classifier designs, making it a Plug-and-Play solution.</description>

      <title>Conditional Vendi Score: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Diversity Evaluation of Prompt-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-conditioned generation models are commonly evaluated based on the quality of the generated data and its alignment with the input text prompt. On the other hand, several applications of prompt-based generative models require sufficient diversity in the generated data to ensure the models' capability of generating image and video samples possessing a variety of features. However, most existing diversity metrics are designed for unconditional generative models, and thus cannot distinguish the diversity arising from variations in text prompts and that contributed by the generative model itself. In this work, our goal is to quantify the prompt-induced and model-induced diversity in samples generated by prompt-based models. We propose an information-theoretic approach for internal diversity quantification, where we decompose the kernel-based entropy $H(X)$ of the generated data $X$ into the sum of the conditional entropy $H(X|T)$, given text variable $T$, and the mutual information $I(X; T)$ between the text and data variables. We introduce the \emph{Conditional-Vendi} score based on $H(X|T)$ to quantify the internal diversity of the model and the \emph{Information-Vendi} score based on $I(X; T)$ to measure the statistical relevance between the generated data and text prompts. We provide theoretical results to statistically interpret these scores and relate them to the unconditional Vendi score. We conduct several numerical experiments to show the correlation between the Conditional-Vendi score and the internal diversity of text-conditioned generative models.

      <title>Layer-Adaptive State Pruning for Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the lack of state dimension optimization methods, deep state space models (SSMs) have sacrificed model capacity, training search space, or stability to alleviate computational costs caused by high state dimensions. In this work, we provide a structured pruning method for SSMs, Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST), which reduces the state dimension of each layer in minimizing model-level energy loss by extending modal truncation for a single system. LAST scores are evaluated using $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems for each state and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33% of states still maintains performance with 0.52% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining. Code is available at $\href{https://github.com/msgwak/LAST}{\text{this https URL}}$.</description>

      <title>On the Comparison between Multi-modal and Single-modal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal contrastive learning with language supervision has presented a paradigm shift in modern machine learning. By pre-training on a web-scale dataset, multi-modal contrastive learning can learn high-quality representations that exhibit impressive robustness and transferability. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding is still in its infancy, especially regarding its comparison with single-modal contrastive learning. In this work, we introduce a feature learning theory framework that provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the differences between multi-modal and single-modal contrastive learning. Based on a data generation model consisting of signal and noise, our analysis is performed on a ReLU network trained with the InfoMax objective function. Through a trajectory-based optimization analysis and generalization characterization on downstream tasks, we identify the critical factor, which is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that impacts the generalizability in downstream tasks of both multi-modal and single-modal contrastive learning. Through the cooperation between the two modalities, multi-modal learning can achieve better feature learning, leading to improvements in performance in downstream tasks compared to single-modal learning. Our analysis provides a unified framework that can characterize the optimization and generalization of both single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets further consolidate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Failure of Invariant Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing node-level Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs remains a crucial area of research. In this paper, we develop a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to theoretically dissect the performance of two prominent invariant learning methods -- Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and Variance-Risk Extrapolation (VREx) -- in node-level OOD settings. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: due to the lack of class-conditional invariance constraints, these methods may struggle to accurately identify the structure of the predictive invariant ego-graph and consequently rely on spurious features. To address this, we propose Cross-environment Intra-class Alignment (CIA), which explicitly eliminates spurious features by aligning cross-environment representations conditioned on the same class, bypassing the need for explicit knowledge of the causal pattern structure. To adapt CIA to node-level OOD scenarios where environment labels are hard to obtain, we further propose CIA-LRA (Localized Reweighting Alignment) that leverages the distribution of neighboring labels to selectively align node representations, effectively distinguishing and preserving invariant features while removing spurious ones, all without relying on environment labels. We theoretically prove CIA-LRA's effectiveness by deriving an OOD generalization error bound based on PAC-Bayesian analysis. Experiments on graph OOD benchmarks validate the superiority of CIA and CIA-LRA, marking a significant advancement in node-level OOD generalization. The codes are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/NeurIPS24-Invariant-Learning-on-Graphs.</description>

      <title>ADOPT: Modified Adam Can Converge with Any $\beta_2$ with the Optimal Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adam is one of the most popular optimization algorithms in deep learning. However, it is known that Adam does not converge in theory unless choosing a hyperparameter, i.e., $\beta_2$, in a problem-dependent manner. There have been many attempts to fix the non-convergence (e.g., AMSGrad), but they require an impractical assumption that the gradient noise is uniformly bounded. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive gradient method named ADOPT, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O} ( 1 / \sqrt{T} )$ with any choice of $\beta_2$ without depending on the bounded noise assumption. ADOPT addresses the non-convergence issue of Adam by removing the current gradient from the second moment estimate and changing the order of the momentum update and the normalization by the second moment estimate. We also conduct intensive numerical experiments, and verify that our ADOPT achieves superior results compared to Adam and its variants across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, generative modeling, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning. The implementation is available at https://github.com/iShohei220/adopt.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Poverty through Intra-Annual Time-Series: A Wavelet Transform Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing global poverty is a key objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires high-frequency, granular data to capture neighborhood-level changes, particularly in data scarce regions such as low- and middle-income countries. To fill in the data gaps, recent computer vision methods combining machine learning (ML) with earth observation (EO) data to improve poverty estimation. However, while much progress have been made, they often omit intra-annual variations, which are crucial for estimating poverty in agriculturally dependent countries. We explored the impact of integrating intra-annual NDVI information with annual multi-spectral data on model accuracy. To evaluate our method, we created a simulated dataset using Landsat imagery and nighttime light data to evaluate EO-ML methods that use intra-annual EO data. Additionally, we evaluated our method against the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across Africa. Our results indicate that integrating specific NDVI-derived features with multi-spectral data provides valuable insights for poverty analysis, emphasizing the importance of retaining intra-annual information.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Robustness via Uncertainty-Aware Distributional Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable achievements in deep learning across various domains, its inherent vulnerability to adversarial examples still remains a critical concern for practical deployment. Adversarial training has emerged as one of the most effective defensive techniques for improving model robustness against such malicious inputs. However, existing adversarial training schemes often lead to limited generalization ability against underlying adversaries with diversity due to their overreliance on a point-by-point augmentation strategy by mapping each clean example to its adversarial counterpart during training. In addition, adversarial examples can induce significant disruptions in the statistical information w.r.t. the target model, thereby introducing substantial uncertainty and challenges to modeling the distribution of adversarial examples. To circumvent these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware distributional adversarial training method, which enforces adversary modeling by leveraging both the statistical information of adversarial examples and its corresponding uncertainty estimation, with the goal of augmenting the diversity of adversaries. Considering the potentially negative impact induced by aligning adversaries to misclassified clean examples, we also refine the alignment reference based on the statistical proximity to clean examples during adversarial training, thereby reframing adversarial training within a distribution-to-distribution matching framework interacted between the clean and adversarial domains. Furthermore, we design an introspective gradient alignment approach via matching input gradients between these domains without introducing external models. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and various network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness and maintains natural performance.</description>

      <title>Photon: Federated LLM Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) demands extensive data and computing resources, which are traditionally constrained to data centers by the high-bandwidth requirements of distributed training. Low-bandwidth methods like federated learning (FL) could enable collaborative training of larger models across weakly-connected GPUs if they can effectively be used for pre-training. To achieve this, we introduce Photon, the first complete system for federated end-to-end LLM training, leveraging cross-silo FL for global-scale training with minimal communication overheads. Using Photon, we train the first federated family of decoder-only LLMs from scratch. We show that: (1) Photon can train model sizes up to 7B in a federated fashion while reaching an even better perplexity than centralized pre-training; (2) Photon model training time decreases with available compute, achieving a similar compute-time trade-off to centralized; and (3) Photon outperforms the wall-time of baseline distributed training methods by 35% via communicating 64x-512xless. Our proposal is robust to data heterogeneity and converges twice as fast as previous methods like DiLoCo. This surprising data efficiency stems from a unique approach combining small client batch sizes with extremely high learning rates, enabled by federated averaging's robustness to hyperparameters. Photon thus represents the first economical system for global internet-wide LLM pre-training.</description>

      <title>Theoretically Guaranteed Distribution Adaptable Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many open environment applications, data are collected in the form of a stream, which exhibits an evolving distribution over time. How to design algorithms to track these evolving data distributions with provable guarantees, particularly in terms of the generalization ability, remains a formidable challenge. To handle this crucial but rarely studied problem and take a further step toward robust artificial intelligence, we propose a novel framework called Distribution Adaptable Learning (DAL). It enables the model to effectively track the evolving data distributions. By Encoding Feature Marginal Distribution Information (EFMDI), we broke the limitations of optimal transport to characterize the environmental changes and enable model reuse across diverse data distributions. It can enhance the reusable and evolvable properties of DAL in accommodating evolving distributions. Furthermore, to obtain the model interpretability, we not only analyze the generalization error bound of the local step in the evolution process, but also investigate the generalization error bound associated with the entire classifier trajectory of the evolution based on the Fisher-Rao distance. For demonstration, we also present two special cases within the framework, together with their optimizations and convergence analyses. Experimental results over both synthetic and real-world data distribution evolving tasks validate the effectiveness and practical utility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Mamba Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving patterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce. However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Time-Causal VAE: Robust Financial Time Series Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a time-causal variational autoencoder (TC-VAE) for robust generation of financial time series data. Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</description>

      <title>A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.</description>

      <title>IMUDiffusion: A Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Synthetisation for Inertial Motion Capturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematic sensors are often used to analyze movement behaviors in sports and daily activities due to their ease of use and lack of spatial restrictions, unlike video-based motion capturing systems. Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</description>

      <title>Embedding Safety into RL: A New Take on Trust Region Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are able to solve a wide variety of tasks but are prone to producing unsafe behaviors. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) provide a popular framework for incorporating safety constraints. However, common solution methods often compromise reward maximization by being overly conservative or allow unsafe behavior during training. We propose Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), a novel approach that modifies the geometry of the policy space based on the safety constraints and yields trust regions composed exclusively of safe policies, ensuring constraint satisfaction throughout training. We theoretically study the convergence and update properties of C-TRPO and highlight connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that C-TRPO significantly reduces constraint violations while achieving competitive reward maximization compared to state-of-the-art CMDP algorithms.</description>

      <title>Confidence Calibration of Classifiers with Many Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For classification models based on neural networks, the maximum predicted class probability is often used as a confidence score. This score rarely predicts well the probability of making a correct prediction and requires a post-processing calibration step. However, many confidence calibration methods fail for problems with many classes. To address this issue, we transform the problem of calibrating a multiclass classifier into calibrating a single surrogate binary classifier. This approach allows for more efficient use of standard calibration methods. We evaluate our approach on numerous neural networks used for image or text classification and show that it significantly enhances existing calibration methods.</description>

      <title>SUDS: A Strategy for Unsupervised Drift Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning often encounters concept drift, where the data distribution changes over time, degrading model performance. Existing drift detection methods focus on identifying these shifts but often overlook the challenge of acquiring labeled data for model retraining after a shift occurs. We present the Strategy for Drift Sampling (SUDS), a novel method that selects homogeneous samples for retraining using existing drift detection algorithms, thereby enhancing model adaptability to evolving data. SUDS seamlessly integrates with current drift detection techniques. We also introduce the Harmonized Annotated Data Accuracy Metric (HADAM), a metric that evaluates classifier performance in relation to the quantity of annotated data required to achieve the stated performance, thereby taking into account the difficulty of acquiring labeled data. Our contributions are twofold: SUDS combines drift detection with strategic sampling to improve the retraining process, and HADAM provides a metric that balances classifier performance with the amount of labeled data, ensuring efficient resource utilization. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of SUDS in optimizing labeled data use in dynamic environments, significantly improving the performance of machine learning applications in real-world scenarios. Our code is open source and available at https://github.com/cfellicious/SUDS/</description>

      <title>Controlling for Unobserved Confounding with Large Language Model Classification of Patient Smoking Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal understanding is a fundamental goal of evidence-based medicine. When randomization is impossible, causal inference methods allow the estimation of treatment effects from retrospective analysis of observational data. However, such analyses rely on a number of assumptions, often including that of no unobserved confounding. In many practical settings, this assumption is violated when important variables are not explicitly measured in the clinical record. Prior work has proposed to address unobserved confounding with machine learning by imputing unobserved variables and then correcting for the classifier's mismeasurement. When such a classifier can be trained and the necessary assumptions are met, this method can recover an unbiased estimate of a causal effect. However, such work has been limited to synthetic data, simple classifiers, and binary variables. This paper extends this methodology by using a large language model trained on clinical notes to predict patients' smoking status, which would otherwise be an unobserved confounder. We then apply a measurement error correction on the categorical predicted smoking status to estimate the causal effect of transthoracic echocardiography on mortality in the MIMIC dataset.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Orchestra of Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning poses a major challenge due to the tendency of agents to experience catastrophic forgetting when learning sequential tasks. In this paper, we introduce a modularity-based approach, called Hierarchical Orchestra of Policies (HOP), designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in lifelong reinforcement learning. HOP dynamically forms a hierarchy of policies based on a similarity metric between the current observations and previously encountered observations in successful tasks. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, HOP does not require task labelling, allowing for robust adaptation in environments where boundaries between tasks are ambiguous. Our experiments, conducted across multiple tasks in a procedurally generated suite of environments, demonstrate that HOP significantly outperforms baseline methods in retaining knowledge across tasks and performs comparably to state-of-the-art transfer methods that require task labelling. Moreover, HOP achieves this without compromising performance when tasks remain constant, highlighting its versatility.</description>

      <title>Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring robust model performance across diverse real-world scenarios requires addressing both transportability across domains with covariate shifts and extrapolation beyond observed data ranges. However, there is no formal procedure for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning algorithms, particularly in causal inference. Existing methods often rely on arbitrary metrics like AUC or MSE and focus predominantly on toy datasets, providing limited insights into real-world applicability. To address this gap, we propose a systematic and quantitative framework for evaluating model generalizability under covariate distribution shifts, specifically within causal inference settings. Our approach leverages the frugal parameterization, allowing for flexible simulations from fully and semi-synthetic benchmarks, offering comprehensive evaluations for both mean and distributional regression methods. By basing simulations on real data, our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics. Grounded in real-world data, it provides realistic insights into model performance, bridging the gap between synthetic evaluations and practical applications.</description>

      <title>DA-MoE: Addressing Depth-Sensitivity in Graph-Level Analysis through Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining popularity for processing graph-structured data. In real-world scenarios, graph data within the same dataset can vary significantly in scale. This variability leads to depth-sensitivity, where the optimal depth of GNN layers depends on the scale of the graph data. Empirically, fewer layers are sufficient for message passing in smaller graphs, while larger graphs typically require deeper networks to capture long-range dependencies and global features. However, existing methods generally use a fixed number of GNN layers to generate representations for all graphs, overlooking the depth-sensitivity issue in graph structure data. To address this challenge, we propose the depth adaptive mixture of expert (DA-MoE) method, which incorporates two main improvements to GNN backbone: \textbf{1)} DA-MoE employs different GNN layers, each considered an expert with its own parameters. Such a design allows the model to flexibly aggregate information at different scales, effectively addressing the depth-sensitivity issue in graph data. \textbf{2)} DA-MoE utilizes GNN to capture the structural information instead of the linear projections in the gating network. Thus, the gating network enables the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data. By leveraging these improvements, each expert in DA-MoE specifically learns distinct graph patterns at different scales. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on the TU dataset and open graph benchmark (OGB) have shown that DA-MoE consistently surpasses existing baselines on various tasks, including graph, node, and link-level analyses. The code are available at \url{https://github.com/Celin-Yao/DA-MoE}.</description>

      <title>Graph Agnostic Causal Bayesian Optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of globally optimising a target variable of an unknown causal graph on which a sequence of soft or hard interventions can be performed. The problem of optimising the target variable associated with a causal graph is formalised as Causal Bayesian Optimisation (CBO). We study the CBO problem under the cumulative regret objective with unknown causal graphs for two settings, namely structural causal models with hard interventions and function networks with soft interventions. We propose Graph Agnostic Causal Bayesian Optimisation (GACBO), an algorithm that actively discovers the causal structure that contributes to achieving optimal rewards. GACBO seeks to balance exploiting the actions that give the best rewards against exploring the causal structures and functions. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study causal Bayesian optimization with cumulative regret objectives in scenarios where the graph is unknown or partially known. We show our proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in simulated experiments and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers Smell Like Humans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain encodes stimuli from the environment into representations that form a sensory perception of the world. Despite recent advances in understanding visual and auditory perception, olfactory perception remains an under-explored topic in the machine learning community due to the lack of large-scale datasets annotated with labels of human olfactory perception. In this work, we ask the question of whether pre-trained transformer models of chemical structures encode representations that are aligned with human olfactory perception, i.e., can transformers smell like humans? We demonstrate that representations encoded from transformers pre-trained on general chemical structures are highly aligned with human olfactory perception. We use multiple datasets and different types of perceptual representations to show that the representations encoded by transformer models are able to predict: (i) labels associated with odorants provided by experts; (ii) continuous ratings provided by human participants with respect to pre-defined descriptors; and (iii) similarity ratings between odorants provided by human participants. Finally, we evaluate the extent to which this alignment is associated with physicochemical features of odorants known to be relevant for olfactory decoding.</description>

      <title>ATM: Improving Model Merging by Alternating Tuning and Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging has recently emerged as a cost-efficient paradigm for multi-task learning. Among current approaches, task arithmetic stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness. In this paper, we motivate the effectiveness of task vectors by linking them to multi-task gradients. We show that in a single-epoch scenario, task vectors are mathematically equivalent to the gradients obtained via gradient descent in a multi-task setting, and still approximate these gradients in subsequent epochs. Furthermore, we show that task vectors perform optimally when equality is maintained, and their effectiveness is largely driven by the first epoch's gradient. Building on this insight, we propose viewing model merging as a single step in an iterative process that Alternates between Tuning and Merging (ATM). This method acts as a bridge between model merging and multi-task gradient descent, achieving state-of-the-art results with the same data and computational requirements. We extensively evaluate ATM across diverse settings, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy in computer vision and NLP tasks, compared to the best baselines.Finally, we provide both empirical and theoretical support for its effectiveness, demonstrating increased orthogonality between task vectors and proving that ATM minimizes an upper bound on the loss obtained by jointly finetuning all tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing DP-SGD through Non-monotonous Adaptive Scaling Gradient Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of deep learning, the challenge of protecting sensitive data while maintaining model utility is significant. Traditional Differential Privacy (DP) techniques such as Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) typically employ strategies like direct or per-sample adaptive gradient clipping. These methods, however, compromise model accuracy due to their critical influence on gradient handling, particularly neglecting the significant contribution of small gradients during later training stages. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced version of DP-SGD, named Differentially Private Per-sample Adaptive Scaling Clipping (DP-PSASC). This approach replaces traditional clipping with non-monotonous adaptive gradient scaling, which alleviates the need for intensive threshold setting and rectifies the disproportionate weighting of smaller gradients. Our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a novel gradient scaling technique that effectively assigns proper weights to gradients, particularly small ones, thus improving learning under differential privacy. Second, we integrate a momentum-based method into DP-PSASC to reduce bias from stochastic sampling, enhancing convergence rates. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that DP-PSASC preserves privacy and delivers superior performance across diverse datasets, setting new standards for privacy-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Alpha and Prejudice: Improving $\alpha$-sized Worst-case Fairness via Intrinsic Reweighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Worst-case fairness with off-the-shelf demographics achieves group parity by maximizing the model utility of the worst-off group. Nevertheless, demographic information is often unavailable in practical scenarios, which impedes the use of such a direct max-min formulation. Recent advances have reframed this learning problem by introducing the lower bound of minimal partition ratio, denoted as $\alpha$, as side information, referred to as ``$\alpha$-sized worst-case fairness'' in this paper. We first justify the practical significance of this setting by presenting noteworthy evidence from the data privacy perspective, which has been overlooked by existing research. Without imposing specific requirements on loss functions, we propose reweighting the training samples based on their intrinsic importance to fairness. Given the global nature of the worst-case formulation, we further develop a stochastic learning scheme to simplify the training process without compromising model performance. Additionally, we address the issue of outliers and provide a robust variant to handle potential outliers during model training. Our theoretical analysis and experimental observations reveal the connections between the proposed approaches and existing ``fairness-through-reweighting'' studies, with extensive experimental results on fairness benchmarks demonstrating the superiority of our methods.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Dynamic Regret for Adversarial Linear Mixture MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study episodic linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition and adversarial rewards under full-information feedback, employing dynamic regret as the performance measure. We start with in-depth analyses of the strengths and limitations of the two most popular methods: occupancy-measure-based and policy-based methods. We observe that while the occupancy-measure-based method is effective in addressing non-stationary environments, it encounters difficulties with the unknown transition. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with the unknown transition effectively but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. Building on this, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the benefits of both methods. Specifically, it employs (i) an occupancy-measure-based global optimization with a two-layer structure to handle non-stationary environments; and (ii) a policy-based variance-aware value-targeted regression to tackle the unknown transition. We bridge these two parts by a novel conversion. Our algorithm enjoys an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d \sqrt{H^3 K} + \sqrt{HK(H + \bar{P}_K)})$ dynamic regret, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode length, $K$ is the number of episodes, $\bar{P}_K$ is the non-stationarity measure. We show it is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors by establishing a matching lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for the Efficient Estimation of Ground-Level Air Temperature in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly populated cities of the 21st Century face the challenge of being sustainable and resilient spaces for their inhabitants. However, climate change, among other problems, makes these objectives difficult to achieve. The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon that occurs in cities, increasing their thermal stress, is one of the stumbling blocks to achieve a more sustainable city. The ability to estimate temperatures with a high degree of accuracy allows for the identification of the highest priority areas in cities where urban improvements need to be made to reduce thermal discomfort. In this work we explore the usefulness of image-to-image deep neural networks (DNNs) for correlating spatial and meteorological variables of a urban area with street-level air temperature. The air temperature at street-level is estimated both spatially and temporally for a specific use case, and compared with existing, well-established numerical models. Based on the obtained results, deep neural networks are confirmed to be faster and less computationally expensive alternative for ground-level air temperature compared to numerical models.</description>

      <title>Navigating Extremes: Dynamic Sparsity in Large Output Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST allows for a more memory efficient training process, as it maintains sparsity throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail to capitalize on this in practice. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, most implementations simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of classification with large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount. With a label space of possibly millions of candidates, the classification layer alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET); however, severely hampers training convergence, especially at the largest label spaces. We find that poor gradient flow from the sparse classifier to the dense text encoder make it difficult to learn good input representations. By employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we demonstrate the applicability and practical benefits of DST in a challenging domain -- characterized by a highly skewed label distribution that differs substantially from typical DST benchmark datasets -- which enables end-to-end training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.</description>

      <title>Beyond Grid Data: Exploring Graph Neural Networks for Earth Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) data analysis has been significantly revolutionized by deep learning (DL), with applications typically limited to grid-like data structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) emerge as an important innovation, propelling DL into the non-Euclidean domain. Naturally, GNNs can effectively tackle the challenges posed by diverse modalities, multiple sensors, and the heterogeneous nature of EO data. To introduce GNNs in the related domains, our review begins by offering fundamental knowledge on GNNs. Then, we summarize the generic problems in EO, to which GNNs can offer potential solutions. Following this, we explore a broad spectrum of GNNs' applications to scientific problems in Earth systems, covering areas such as weather and climate analysis, disaster management, air quality monitoring, agriculture, land cover classification, hydrological process modeling, and urban modeling. The rationale behind adopting GNNs in these fields is explained, alongside methodologies for organizing graphs and designing favorable architectures for various tasks. Furthermore, we highlight methodological challenges of implementing GNNs in these domains and possible solutions that could guide future research. While acknowledging that GNNs are not a universal solution, we conclude the paper by comparing them with other popular architectures like transformers and analyzing their potential synergies.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Predictive Models for Healthcare via Rational Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The healthcare sector has experienced a rapid accumulation of digital data recently, especially in the form of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs constitute a precious resource that IS researchers could utilize for clinical applications (e.g., morbidity prediction). Deep learning seems like the obvious choice to exploit this surfeit of data. However, numerous studies have shown that deep learning does not enjoy the same kind of success on EHR data as it has in other domains; simple models like logistic regression are frequently as good as sophisticated deep learning ones. Inspired by this observation, we develop a novel model called rational logistic regression (RLR) that has standard logistic regression (LR) as its special case (and thus inherits LR's inductive bias that aligns with EHR data). RLR has rational series as its theoretical underpinnings, works on longitudinal time-series data, and learns interpretable patterns. Empirical comparisons on real-world clinical tasks demonstrate RLR's efficacy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Transformer Training Efficiency with Dynamic Dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Dropout, a novel regularization technique designed to enhance the training efficiency of Transformer models by dynamically adjusting the dropout rate based on training epochs or validation loss improvements. This approach addresses the challenge of balancing regularization and model capacity, which is crucial for achieving fast convergence and high performance. Our method involves modifying the GPT model to accept a variable dropout rate and updating dropout layers during training using schedules such as linear decay, exponential decay, and validation loss-based adjustments. Extensive experiments on the Shakespeare\_char dataset demonstrate that Dynamic Dropout significantly accelerates training and improves inference efficiency compared to a baseline model with a fixed dropout rate. The validation loss-based adjustment schedule provided the best overall performance, highlighting the potential of Dynamic Dropout as a valuable technique for training large-scale Transformer models.</description>

      <title>DiffLM: Controllable Synthetic Data Generation via Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2-7 percent in certain cases. The data and code will be publicly available upon completion of internal review.</description>

      <title>Discovering Data Structures: Nearest Neighbor Search and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for end-to-end learning of data structures. Our framework adapts to the underlying data distribution and provides fine-grained control over query and space complexity. Crucially, the data structure is learned from scratch, and does not require careful initialization or seeding with candidate data structures/algorithms. We first apply this framework to the problem of nearest neighbor search. In several settings, we are able to reverse-engineer the learned data structures and query algorithms. For 1D nearest neighbor search, the model discovers optimal distribution (in)dependent algorithms such as binary search and variants of interpolation search. In higher dimensions, the model learns solutions that resemble k-d trees in some regimes, while in others, they have elements of locality-sensitive hashing. The model can also learn useful representations of high-dimensional data and exploit them to design effective data structures. We also adapt our framework to the problem of estimating frequencies over a data stream, and believe it could also be a powerful discovery tool for new problems.</description>

      <title>Proxy-informed Bayesian transfer learning with unknown sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Bayesian transfer learning is a principled paradigm for specifying this knowledge, and refining it on the basis of data from the source (training) and target (prediction) tasks. We address the challenging transfer learning setting where the learner (i) cannot fine-tune in the target task, and (ii) does not know which source data points correspond to the same task (i.e., the data sources are unknown). We propose a proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), which provides a posterior predictive estimate tailored to the structure of the target task, without requiring the learner have access to any outcome information from the target task. Instead, PROMPT relies on the availability of proxy information. PROMPT uses the same proxy information for two purposes: (i) estimation of effects specific to the target task, and (ii) construction of a robust reweighting of the source data for estimation of effects that transfer between tasks. We provide theoretical results on the effect of this reweighting on the risk of negative transfer, and demonstrate application of PROMPT in two synthetic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to semi-supervised learning for the classification of data using the Lipschitz Learning on graphs. We develop a graph-based semi-supervised learning framework that leverages the properties of the infinity Laplacian to propagate labels in a dataset where only a few samples are labeled. By extending the theory of spatial segregation from the Laplace operator to the infinity Laplace operator, both in continuum and discrete settings, our approach provides a robust method for dealing with class imbalance, a common challenge in machine learning. Experimental validation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method not only improves classification accuracy compared to existing methods but also ensures efficient label propagation in scenarios with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Oblivious Defense in ML Models: Backdoor Removal without Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As society grows more reliant on machine learning, ensuring the security of machine learning systems against sophisticated attacks becomes a pressing concern. A recent result of Goldwasser, Kim, Vaikuntanathan, and Zamir (2022) shows that an adversary can plant undetectable backdoors in machine learning models, allowing the adversary to covertly control the model's behavior. Backdoors can be planted in such a way that the backdoored machine learning model is computationally indistinguishable from an honest model without backdoors.
  In this paper, we present strategies for defending against backdoors in ML models, even if they are undetectable. The key observation is that it is sometimes possible to provably mitigate or even remove backdoors without needing to detect them, using techniques inspired by the notion of random self-reducibility. This depends on properties of the ground-truth labels (chosen by nature), and not of the proposed ML model (which may be chosen by an attacker).
  We give formal definitions for secure backdoor mitigation, and proceed to show two types of results. First, we show a "global mitigation" technique, which removes all backdoors from a machine learning model under the assumption that the ground-truth labels are close to a Fourier-heavy function. Second, we consider distributions where the ground-truth labels are close to a linear or polynomial function in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Here, we show "local mitigation" techniques, which remove backdoors with high probability for every inputs of interest, and are computationally cheaper than global mitigation. All of our constructions are black-box, so our techniques work without needing access to the model's representation (i.e., its code or parameters). Along the way we prove a simple result for robust mean estimation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Saliency Ranking and Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ever-growing variety of object detection approaches, this study explores a series of experiments that combine reinforcement learning (RL)-based visual attention methods with saliency ranking techniques to investigate transparent and sustainable solutions. By integrating saliency ranking for initial bounding box prediction and subsequently applying RL techniques to refine these predictions through a finite set of actions over multiple time steps, this study aims to enhance RL object detection accuracy. Presented as a series of experiments, this research investigates the use of various image feature extraction methods and explores diverse Deep Q-Network (DQN) architectural variations for deep reinforcement learning-based localisation agent training. Additionally, we focus on optimising the detection pipeline at every step by prioritising lightweight and faster models, while also incorporating the capability to classify detected objects, a feature absent in previous RL approaches. We show that by evaluating the performance of these trained agents using the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, faster and more optimised models were developed. Notably, the best mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved in this study was 51.4, surpassing benchmarks set by RL-based single object detectors in the literature.</description>

      <title>Advanced computer vision for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from drone imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone footage, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and limitations of traditional ground-based systems. We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport Maps are Good Voice Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, neural network-based methods for computing optimal transport maps have been effectively applied to style transfer problems. However, the application of these methods to voice conversion is underexplored. In our paper, we fill this gap by investigating optimal transport as a framework for voice conversion. We present a variety of optimal transport algorithms designed for different data representations, such as mel-spectrograms and latent representation of self-supervised speech models. For the mel-spectogram data representation, we achieve strong results in terms of Frechet Audio Distance (FAD). This performance is consistent with our theoretical analysis, which suggests that our method provides an upper bound on the FAD between the target and generated distributions. Within the latent space of the WavLM encoder, we achived state-of-the-art results and outperformed existing methods even with limited reference speaker data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retrieval Performance: An Ensemble Approach For Hard Negative Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking consistently emerges as a primary focus in information retrieval research. Retrieval and ranking models serve as the foundation for numerous applications, including web search, open domain QA, enterprise domain QA, and text-based recommender systems. Typically, these models undergo training on triplets consisting of binary relevance assignments, comprising one positive and one negative passage. However, their utilization involves a context where a significantly more nuanced understanding of relevance is necessary, especially when re-ranking a large pool of potentially relevant passages. Although collecting positive examples through user feedback like impressions or clicks is straightforward, identifying suitable negative pairs from a vast pool of possibly millions or even billions of documents possess a greater challenge. Generating a substantial number of negative pairs is often necessary to maintain the high quality of the model. Several approaches have been suggested in literature to tackle the issue of selecting suitable negative pairs from an extensive corpus. This study focuses on explaining the crucial role of hard negatives in the training process of cross-encoder models, specifically aiming to explain the performance gains observed with hard negative sampling compared to random sampling. We have developed a robust hard negative mining technique for efficient training of cross-encoder re-rank models on an enterprise dataset which has domain specific context. We provide a novel perspective to enhance retrieval models, ultimately influencing the performance of advanced LLM systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reasoning and Action Agents (ReAct). The proposed approach demonstrates that learning both similarity and dissimilarity simultaneously with cross-encoders improves performance of retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>Slicing for AI: An Online Learning Framework for Network Slicing Supporting AI Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming 6G networks will embrace a new realm of AI-driven services that requires innovative network slicing strategies, namely slicing for AI, which involves the creation of customized network slices to meet Quality of service (QoS) requirements of diverse AI services. This poses challenges due to time-varying dynamics of users' behavior and mobile networks. Thus, this paper proposes an online learning framework to optimize the allocation of computational and communication resources to AI services, while considering their unique key performance indicators (KPIs), such as accuracy, latency, and cost. We define a problem of optimizing the total accuracy while balancing conflicting KPIs, prove its NP-hardness, and propose an online learning framework for solving it in dynamic environments. We present a basic online solution and two variations employing a pre-learning elimination method for reducing the decision space to expedite the learning. Furthermore, we propose a biased decision space subset selection by incorporating prior knowledge to enhance the learning speed without compromising performance and present two alternatives of handling the selected subset. Our results depict the efficiency of the proposed solutions in converging to the optimal decisions, while reducing decision space and improving time complexity.</description>

      <title>Fairness Evaluation with Item Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) has been widely used in educational psychometrics to assess student ability, as well as the difficulty and discrimination of test questions. In this context, discrimination specifically refers to how effectively a question distinguishes between students of different ability levels, and it does not carry any connotation related to fairness. In recent years, IRT has been successfully used to evaluate the predictive performance of Machine Learning (ML) models, but this paper marks its first application in fairness evaluation. In this paper, we propose a novel Fair-IRT framework to evaluate a set of predictive models on a set of individuals, while simultaneously eliciting specific parameters, namely, the ability to make fair predictions (a feature of predictive models), as well as the discrimination and difficulty of individuals that affect the prediction results. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments to comprehensively understand the implications of these parameters for fairness evaluation. Detailed explanations for item characteristic curves (ICCs) are provided for particular individuals. We propose the flatness of ICCs to disentangle the unfairness between individuals and predictive models. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework as a fairness evaluation tool. Two real-world case studies illustrate its potential application in evaluating fairness in both classification and regression tasks. Our paper aligns well with the Responsible Web track by proposing a Fair-IRT framework to evaluate fairness in ML models, which directly contributes to the development of a more inclusive, equitable, and trustworthy AI.</description>

      <title>Data Matters: The Case of Predicting Mobile Cellular Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of base stations' traffic load are essential to mobile cellular operators and their users as they support the efficient use of network resources and sustain smart cities and roads. Traditionally, cellular network time-series have been considered for this prediction task. More recently, exogenous factors such as points of presence and other environmental knowledge have been introduced to facilitate cellular traffic forecasting. In this study, we focus on smart roads and explore road traffic measures to model the processes underlying cellular traffic generation with the goal to improve prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that by employing road flow and speed, in addition to cellular network metrics, cellular load prediction errors can be reduced by as much as 56.5 %.

      <title>XAI-FUNGI: Dataset resulting from the user study on comprehensibility of explainable AI algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset that is the result of a user study on the comprehensibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. The study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Performance of Deep Learning for Predicting Gliomas' IDH and 1p/19q Status in MRI: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, show high heterogeneity in histological and molecular characteristics. Accurate molecular profiling, like isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This review evaluates MRI-based deep learning (DL) models' efficacy in predicting these biomarkers. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science) up to February 2024, screening studies that utilized DL to predict IDH and 1p/19q codeletion status from MRI data of glioma patients. We assessed the quality and risk of bias using the radiomics quality score and QUADAS-2 tool. Our meta-analysis used a bivariate model to compute pooled sensitivity, specificity, and meta-regression to assess inter-study heterogeneity. Of the 565 articles, 57 were selected for qualitative synthesis, and 52 underwent meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed high diagnostic performance, with validation sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84 [prediction interval (PI): 0.67-0.93, I2=51.10%, p &lt; 0.05], 0.87 [PI: 0.49-0.98, I2=82.30%, p &lt; 0.05], and 0.89 for IDH prediction, and 0.76 [PI: 0.28-0.96, I2=77.60%, p &lt; 0.05], 0.85 [PI: 0.49-0.97, I2=80.30%, p &lt; 0.05], and 0.90 for 1p/19q prediction, respectively. Meta-regression analyses revealed significant heterogeneity influenced by glioma grade, data source, inclusion of non-radiomics data, MRI sequences, segmentation and feature extraction methods, and validation techniques. DL models demonstrate strong potential in predicting molecular biomarkers from MRI scans, with significant variability influenced by technical and clinical factors. Thorough external validation is necessary to increase clinical utility.</description>

      <title>NMformer: A Transformer for Noisy Modulation Classification in Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulation classification is a very challenging task since the signals intertwine with various ambient noises. Methods are required that can classify them without adding extra steps like denoising, which introduces computational complexity. In this study, we propose a vision transformer (ViT) based model named NMformer to predict the channel modulation images with different noise levels in wireless communication. Since ViTs are most effective for RGB images, we generated constellation diagrams from the modulated signals. The diagrams provide the information from the signals in a 2-D representation form. We trained NMformer on 106, 800 modulation images to build the base classifier and only used 3, 000 images to fine-tune for specific tasks. Our proposed model has two different kinds of prediction setups: in-distribution and out-of-distribution. Our model achieves 4.67% higher accuracy than the base classifier when finetuned and tested on high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in-distribution classes. Moreover, the fine-tuned low SNR task achieves a higher accuracy than the base classifier. The fine-tuned classifier becomes much more effective than the base classifier by achieving higher accuracy when predicted, even on unseen data from out-of-distribution classes. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of NMformer for a wide range of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Generative Emotion Cause Explanation in Multimodal Conversations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically uses clause selection methods to locate the reason utterance, without providing a detailed explanation of the emotional causes. In this paper, we propose a new task, \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{C}onversation \textbf{E}motion \textbf{C}ause \textbf{E}xplanation (MCECE), aiming to generate a detailed explanation of the emotional cause to the target utterance within a multimodal conversation scenario. Building upon the MELD dataset, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) that integrates video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, facilitating an in-depth examination of the causal factors behind emotional expressions in multimodal conversations.A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net significantly outperforms several excellent large language model baselines. Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/3222345200/ECEMdataset.git}</description>

      <title>An Efficient Hierarchical Preconditioner-Learner Architecture for Reconstructing Multi-scale Basis Functions of High-dimensional Subsurface Fluid Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling subsurface fluid flow in porous media is crucial for applications such as oil and gas exploration. However, the inherent heterogeneity and multi-scale characteristics of these systems pose significant challenges in accurately reconstructing fluid flow behaviors. To address this issue, we proposed Fourier Preconditioner-based Hierarchical Multiscale Net (FP-HMsNet), an efficient hierarchical preconditioner-learner architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) with multi-scale neural networks to reconstruct multi-scale basis functions of high-dimensional subsurface fluid flow. Using a dataset comprising 102,757 training samples, 34,252 validation samples, and 34,254 test samples, we ensured the reliability and generalization capability of the model. Experimental results showed that FP-HMsNet achieved an MSE of 0.0036, an MAE of 0.0375, and an R2 of 0.9716 on the testing set, significantly outperforming existing models and demonstrating exceptional accuracy and generalization ability. Additionally, robustness tests revealed that the model maintained stability under various levels of noise interference. Ablation studies confirmed the critical contribution of the preconditioner and multi-scale pathways to the model's performance. Compared to current models, FP-HMsNet not only achieved lower errors and higher accuracy but also demonstrated faster convergence and improved computational efficiency, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. This model offers a novel method for efficient and accurate subsurface fluid flow modeling, with promising potential for more complex real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Narrative data spans all disciplines and provides a coherent model of the world to the reader or viewer. Recent advancement in machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have enable great strides in analyzing natural language. However, Large language models (LLMs) still struggle with complex narrative arcs as well as narratives containing conflicting information. Recent work indicates LLMs augmented with external knowledge bases can improve the accuracy and interpretability of the resulting models. In this work, we analyze the effectiveness of applying knowledge graphs (KGs) in understanding true-crime podcast data from both classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLM approaches. We directly compare KG-augmented LLMs (KGLLMs) with classical methods for KG construction, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the KGLLM allows us to query the knowledge base in natural language and test its ability to factually answer questions. We examine the robustness of the model to adversarial prompting in order to test the model's ability to deal with conflicting information. Finally, we apply classical methods to understand more subtle aspects of the text such as the use of hearsay and sentiment in narrative construction and propose future directions. Our results indicate that KGLLMs outperform LLMs on a variety of metrics, are more robust to adversarial prompts, and are more capable of summarizing the text into topics.</description>

      <title>A Coverage-Guided Testing Framework for Quantum Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) combine quantum computing and neural networks, leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to improve machine learning models. These quantum characteristics enable QNNs to potentially outperform classical neural networks in tasks such as quantum chemistry simulations, optimization problems, and quantum-enhanced machine learning. However, they also introduce significant challenges in verifying the correctness and reliability of QNNs. To address this, we propose QCov, a set of test coverage criteria specifically designed for QNNs to systematically evaluate QNN state exploration during testing, focusing on superposition and entanglement. These criteria help detect quantum-specific defects and anomalies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and QNN models validate QCov's effectiveness in identifying quantum-specific defects and guiding fuzz testing, thereby improving QNN robustness and reliability.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution without High-Resolution Labels for Black Hole Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-resolution simulations is key for advancing our understanding of one of the universe's most violent events: Black Hole mergers. However, generating Black Hole simulations is limited by prohibitive computational costs and scalability issues, reducing the simulation's fidelity and resolution achievable within reasonable time frames and resources. In this work, we introduce a novel method that circumvents these limitations by applying a super-resolution technique without directly needing high-resolution labels, leveraging the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints-fundamental equations in general relativity that govern the dynamics of spacetime. We demonstrate that our method achieves a reduction in constraint violation by one to two orders of magnitude and generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution simulations.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Confidence Calibration for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One important approach to improving the reliability of large language models (LLMs) is to provide accurate confidence estimations regarding the correctness of their answers. However, developing a well-calibrated confidence estimation model is challenging, as mistakes made by LLMs can be difficult to detect. We propose a novel method combining the LLM's self-consistency with labeled data and training an auxiliary model to estimate the correctness of its responses to questions. This auxiliary model predicts the correctness of responses based solely on their consistent information. To set up the learning problem, we use a weighted graph to represent the consistency among the LLM's multiple responses to a question. Correctness labels are assigned to these responses based on their similarity to the correct answer. We then train a graph neural network to estimate the probability of correct responses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms several of the most recent methods in confidence calibration across multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improves the generalization capability of confidence calibration on out-of-domain (OOD) data.</description>

      <title>Code-Switching Curriculum Learning for Multilingual Transfer in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in various tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of high-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching (the practice of language alternation in a conversation), we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Unit Test Generation: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) like GitHub Copilot has significantly enhanced programmers' productivity, particularly in code generation. However, these models often struggle with real-world tasks without fine-tuning. As LLMs grow larger and more performant, fine-tuning for specialized tasks becomes increasingly expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which fine-tune only a subset of model parameters, offer a promising solution by reducing the computational costs of tuning LLMs while maintaining their performance. Existing studies have explored using PEFT and LLMs for various code-related tasks and found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques is task-dependent. The application of PEFT techniques in unit test generation remains underexplored. The state-of-the-art is limited to using LLMs with full fine-tuning to generate unit tests. This paper investigates both full fine-tuning and various PEFT methods, including LoRA, (IA)^3, and prompt tuning, across different model architectures and sizes. We use well-established benchmark datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in unit test generation. Our findings show that PEFT methods can deliver performance comparable to full fine-tuning for unit test generation, making specialized fine-tuning more accessible and cost-effective. Notably, prompt tuning is the most effective in terms of cost and resource utilization, while LoRA approaches the effectiveness of full fine-tuning in several cases.</description>

      <title>Weakly supervised deep learning model with size constraint for prostate cancer detection in multiparametric MRI and generalization to unseen domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully supervised deep models have shown promising performance for many medical segmentation tasks. Still, the deployment of these tools in clinics is limited by the very timeconsuming collection of manually expert-annotated data. Moreover, most of the state-ofthe-art models have been trained and validated on moderately homogeneous datasets. It is known that deep learning methods are often greatly degraded by domain or label shifts and are yet to be built in such a way as to be robust to unseen data or label distributions. In the clinical setting, this problematic is particularly relevant as the deployment institutions may have different scanners or acquisition protocols than those from which the data has been collected to train the model. In this work, we propose to address these two challenges on the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) from bi-parametric MRI. We evaluate the method proposed by (Kervadec et al., 2018), which introduces a size constaint loss to produce fine semantic cancer lesions segmentations from weak circle scribbles annotations. Performance of the model is based on two public (PI-CAI and Prostate158) and one private databases. First, we show that the model achieves on-par performance with strong fully supervised baseline models, both on in-distribution validation data and unseen test images. Second, we observe a performance decrease for both fully supervised and weakly supervised models when tested on unseen data domains. This confirms the crucial need for efficient domain adaptation methods if deep learning models are aimed to be deployed in a clinical environment. Finally, we show that ensemble predictions from multiple trainings increase generalization performance.</description>

      <title>First observations of the seiche that shook the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On September 16th, 2023, an anomalous 10.88 mHz seismic signal was observed globally, persisting for 9 days. One month later an identical signal appeared, lasting for another week. Several studies have theorized that these signals were produced by seiches which formed after two landslide generated mega-tsunamis in an East-Greenland fjord. This theory is supported by seismic inversions, and analytical and numerical modeling, but no direct observations have been made -- until now. Using data from the new Surface Water Ocean Topography mission, we present the first observations of this phenomenon. By ruling out other oceanographic processes, we validate the seiche theory of previous authors and independently estimate its initial amplitude at 7.9 m using Bayesian machine learning and seismic data. This study demonstrates the value of satellite altimetry for studying extreme events, while also highlighting the need for specialized methods to address the altimetric data's limitations, namely temporal sparsity. These data and approaches will help in understanding future unseen extremes driven by climate change.</description>

      <title>Digitizing Touch with an Artificial Multimodal Fingertip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Touch is a crucial sensing modality that provides rich information about object properties and interactions with the physical environment. Humans and robots both benefit from using touch to perceive and interact with the surrounding environment (Johansson and Flanagan, 2009; Li et al., 2020; Calandra et al., 2017). However, no existing systems provide rich, multi-modal digital touch-sensing capabilities through a hemispherical compliant embodiment. Here, we describe several conceptual and technological innovations to improve the digitization of touch. These advances are embodied in an artificial finger-shaped sensor with advanced sensing capabilities. Significantly, this fingertip contains high-resolution sensors (~8.3 million taxels) that respond to omnidirectional touch, capture multi-modal signals, and use on-device artificial intelligence to process the data in real time. Evaluations show that the artificial fingertip can resolve spatial features as small as 7 um, sense normal and shear forces with a resolution of 1.01 mN and 1.27 mN, respectively, perceive vibrations up to 10 kHz, sense heat, and even sense odor. Furthermore, it embeds an on-device AI neural network accelerator that acts as a peripheral nervous system on a robot and mimics the reflex arc found in humans. These results demonstrate the possibility of digitizing touch with superhuman performance. The implications are profound, and we anticipate potential applications in robotics (industrial, medical, agricultural, and consumer-level), virtual reality and telepresence, prosthetics, and e-commerce. Toward digitizing touch at scale, we open-source a modular platform to facilitate future research on the nature of touch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a policy that can generalize to unknown objects is a long standing challenge within the field of robotics. The performance of a policy often drops significantly in situations where an object in the scene was not seen during training. To solve this problem, we present NeRF-Aug, a novel method that is capable of teaching a policy to interact with objects that are not present in the dataset. This approach differs from existing approaches by leveraging the speed and photorealism of a neural radiance field for augmentation. NeRF- Aug both creates more photorealistic data and runs 3.83 times faster than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 4 tasks with 11 novel objects that have no expert demonstration data. We achieve an average 69.1% success rate increase over existing methods.

      <description>arXiv:2411.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning enables unbinned, highly-differential cross section measurements. A recent idea uses generative models to morph a starting simulation into the unfolded data. We show how to extend two morphing techniques, Schr\"odinger Bridges and Direct Diffusion, in order to ensure that the models learn the correct conditional probabilities. This brings distribution mapping to a similar level of accuracy as the state-of-the-art conditional generative unfolding methods. Numerical results are presented with a standard benchmark dataset of single jet substructure as well as for a new dataset describing a 22-dimensional phase space of Z + 2-jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) studies decision problems under uncertainty where the probability distribution governing the uncertain problem parameters is itself uncertain. A key component of any DRO model is its ambiguity set, that is, a family of probability distributions consistent with any available structural or statistical information. DRO seeks decisions that perform best under the worst distribution in the ambiguity set. This worst case criterion is supported by findings in psychology and neuroscience, which indicate that many decision-makers have a low tolerance for distributional ambiguity. DRO is rooted in statistics, operations research and control theory, and recent research has uncovered its deep connections to regularization techniques and adversarial training in machine learning. This survey presents the key findings of the field in a unified and self-contained manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most ost Big Data datasets suffer from selection bias. For example, X (Twitter) training observations differ largely from the testing offline observations as individuals on Twitter are generally more educated, democratic or left-leaning. Therefore, one major obstacle to reliable estimation is the differences between training and testing data. How can researchers make use of such data even in the presence of non-ignorable selection mechanisms? A number of methods have been developed for this issue, such as distributionally robust optimization (DRO) or learning fairness. A possible avenue to reducing the effect of bias is meta-information. Researchers, being field exerts, might have prior information on the form and extent of selection bias affecting their dataset, and in which direction the selection might cause the estimate to change, e.g. over or under estimation. At the same time, there is no direct way to leverage these types of information in learning. I propose a loss function which takes into account two types of meta data information given by the researcher: quantity and direction (under or over sampling) of bias in the training set. Estimation with the proposed loss function is then implemented through a neural network, the directional Rockafellar-Uryasev (dRU) regression model. I test the dRU model on a biased training dataset, a Big Data online drawn electoral poll. I apply the proposed model using meta data information coherent with the political and sampling information obtained from previous studies. The results show that including meta information improves the electoral results predictions compared to a model that does not include them.</description>

      <title>MM-Embed: Universal Multimodal Retrieval with Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, where retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but underperforms a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to modality bias from MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose to continually fine-tune the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while maintaining multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on MTEB retrieval benchmark. Finally, we explore to prompt the off-the-shelf MLLMs as the zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way to advance universal multimodal retrieval in the future.</description>

Given an optimization problem, the first stage of the methodology is to design an appropriate electric circuit whose continuous-time dynamics converge to the solution of the optimization problem at hand. Then, the second stage is an automated, computer-assisted discretization of the continuous-time dynamics, yielding a provably convergent discrete-time algorithm. Our methodology recovers many classical (distributed) optimization algorithms and enables users to quickly design and explore a wide range of new algorithms with convergence guarantees.</description>

Abstract: Social support, conveyed through a multitude of interactions and platforms such as social media, plays a pivotal role in fostering a sense of belonging, aiding resilience in the face of challenges, and enhancing overall well-being. This paper introduces Social Support Detection (SSD) as a Natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at identifying supportive interactions within online communities. The study presents the task of Social Support Detection (SSD) in three subtasks: two binary classification tasks and one multiclass task, with labels detailed in the dataset section. We conducted experiments on a dataset comprising 10,000 YouTube comments. Traditional machine learning models were employed, utilizing various feature combinations that encompass linguistic, psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment information. Additionally, we experimented with neural network-based models using various word embeddings to enhance the performance of our models across these subtasks.The results reveal a prevalence of group-oriented support in online dialogues, reflecting broader societal patterns. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment features with n-grams in detecting social support and distinguishing whether it is directed toward an individual or a group. The best results for different subtasks across all experiments range from 0.72 to 0.82.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Decision Transformers for Dynamic Dispatching in Material Handling Systems Leveraging Enterprise Big Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic dispatching rules that allocate resources to tasks in real-time play a critical role in ensuring efficient operations of many automated material handling systems across industries. Traditionally, the dispatching rules deployed are typically the result of manually crafted heuristics based on domain experts' knowledge. Generating these rules is time-consuming and often sub-optimal. As enterprises increasingly accumulate vast amounts of operational data, there is significant potential to leverage this big data to enhance the performance of automated systems. One promising approach is to use Decision Transformers, which can be trained on existing enterprise data to learn better dynamic dispatching rules for improving system throughput. In this work, we study the application of Decision Transformers as dynamic dispatching policies within an actual multi-agent material handling system and identify scenarios where enterprises can effectively leverage Decision Transformers on existing big data to gain business value. Our empirical results demonstrate that Decision Transformers can improve the material handling system's throughput by a considerable amount when the heuristic originally used in the enterprise data exhibits moderate performance and involves no randomness. When the original heuristic has strong performance, Decision Transformers can still improve the throughput but with a smaller improvement margin. However, when the original heuristics contain an element of randomness or when the performance of the dataset is below a certain threshold, Decision Transformers fail to outperform the original heuristic. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of Decision Transformers as dispatching policies for automated industrial material handling systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a tracking-based HD mapping algorithm for top-down road images, referred to as tile images. While HD maps traditionally rely on perspective camera images, our approach shows that tile images can also be effectively utilized, offering valuable contributions to this research area as it can be start of a new path in HD mapping algorithms. We modified the BEVFormer layers to generate BEV masks from tile images, which are then used by the model to generate divider and boundary lines. Our model was tested with both color and intensity images, and we present quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate its performance.</description>

      <title>Vocal Sandbox: Continual Learning and Adaptation for Situated Human-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Vocal Sandbox, a framework for enabling seamless human-robot collaboration in situated environments. Systems in our framework are characterized by their ability to adapt and continually learn at multiple levels of abstraction from diverse teaching modalities such as spoken dialogue, object keypoints, and kinesthetic demonstrations. To enable such adaptation, we design lightweight and interpretable learning algorithms that allow users to build an understanding and co-adapt to a robot's capabilities in real-time, as they teach new behaviors. For example, after demonstrating a new low-level skill for "tracking around" an object, users are provided with trajectory visualizations of the robot's intended motion when asked to track a new object. Similarly, users teach high-level planning behaviors through spoken dialogue, using pretrained language models to synthesize behaviors such as "packing an object away" as compositions of low-level skills $-$ concepts that can be reused and built upon. We evaluate Vocal Sandbox in two settings: collaborative gift bag assembly and LEGO stop-motion animation. In the first setting, we run systematic ablations and user studies with 8 non-expert participants, highlighting the impact of multi-level teaching. Across 23 hours of total robot interaction time, users teach 17 new high-level behaviors with an average of 16 novel low-level skills, requiring 22.1% less active supervision compared to baselines and yielding more complex autonomous performance (+19.7%) with fewer failures (-67.1%). Qualitatively, users strongly prefer Vocal Sandbox systems due to their ease of use (+20.6%) and overall performance (+13.9%). Finally, we pair an experienced system-user with a robot to film a stop-motion animation; over two hours of continuous collaboration, the user teaches progressively more complex motion skills to shoot a 52 second (232 frame) movie.</description>

      <title>Computing critical exponents in 3D Ising model via pattern recognition/deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we computed three critical exponents ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for the 3D Ising model with Metropolis Algorithm using Finite-Size Scaling Analysis on six cube length scales (L=20,30,40,60,80,90), and performed a supervised Deep Learning (DL) approach (3D Convolutional Neural Network or CNN) to train a neural network on specific conformations of spin states. We find one can effectively reduce the information in thermodynamic ensemble-averaged quantities vs. reduced temperature t (magnetization per spin $&lt;m&gt;(t)$, specific heat per spin $&lt;c&gt;(t)$, magnetic susceptibility per spin $&lt;\chi&gt;(t)$) to \textit{six} latent classes. We also demonstrate our CNN on a subset of L=20 conformations and achieve a train/test accuracy of 0.92 and 0.6875, respectively. However, more work remains to be done to quantify the feasibility of computing critical exponents from the output class labels (binned $m, c, \chi$) from this approach and interpreting the results from DL models trained on systems in Condensed Matter Physics in general.</description>

      <title>TeleOracle: Fine-Tuned Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Support for Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The telecommunications industry's rapid evolution demands intelligent systems capable of managing complex networks and adapting to emerging technologies. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in addressing these challenges, their deployment in telecom environments faces significant constraints due to edge device limitations and inconsistent documentation. To bridge this gap, we present TeleOracle, a telecom-specialized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system built on the Phi-2 small language model (SLM). To improve context retrieval, TeleOracle employs a two-stage retriever that incorporates semantic chunking and hybrid keyword and semantic search. Additionally, we expand the context window during inference to enhance the model's performance on open-ended queries. We also employ low-rank adaption for efficient fine-tuning. A thorough analysis of the model's performance indicates that our RAG framework is effective in aligning Phi-2 to the telecom domain in a downstream question and answer (QnA) task, achieving a 30% improvement in accuracy over the base Phi-2 model, reaching an overall accuracy of 81.20%. Notably, we show that our model not only performs on par with the much larger LLMs but also achieves a higher faithfulness score, indicating higher adherence to the retrieved context.</description>

      <title>Learning to Assist Humans without Inferring Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assistive agents should make humans' lives easier. Classically, such assistance is studied through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning, where an assistive agent (e.g., a chatbot, a robot) infers a human's intention and then selects actions to help the human reach that goal. This approach requires inferring intentions, which can be difficult in high-dimensional settings. We build upon prior work that studies assistance through the lens of empowerment: an assistive agent aims to maximize the influence of the human's actions such that they exert a greater control over the environmental outcomes and can solve tasks in fewer steps. We lift the major limitation of prior work in this area--scalability to high-dimensional settings--with contrastive successor representations. We formally prove that these representations estimate a similar notion of empowerment to that studied by prior work and provide a ready-made mechanism for optimizing it. Empirically, our proposed method outperforms prior methods on synthetic benchmarks, and scales to Overcooked, a cooperative game setting. Theoretically, our work connects ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and reinforcement learning, and charts a path for representations to play a critical role in solving assistive problems.</description>

      <title>Extracting Unlearned Information from LLMs with Activation Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An unintended consequence of the vast pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) is the verbatim memorization of fragments of their training data, which may contain sensitive or copyrighted information. In recent years, unlearning has emerged as a solution to effectively remove sensitive knowledge from models after training. Yet, recent work has shown that supposedly deleted information can still be extracted by malicious actors through various attacks. Still, current attacks retrieve sets of possible candidate generations and are unable to pinpoint the output that contains the actual target information. We propose activation steering as a method for exact information retrieval from unlearned LLMs. We introduce a novel approach to generating steering vectors, named Anonymized Activation Steering. Additionally, we develop a simple word frequency method to pinpoint the correct answer among a set of candidates when retrieving unlearned information. Our evaluation across multiple unlearning techniques and datasets demonstrates that activation steering successfully recovers general knowledge (e.g., widely known fictional characters) while revealing limitations in retrieving specific information (e.g., details about non-public individuals). Overall, our results demonstrate that exact information retrieval from unlearned models is possible, highlighting a severe vulnerability of current unlearning techniques.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Video Recording Optimization using Activity Detection for Surveillance Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surveillance systems often struggle with managing vast amounts of footage, much of which is irrelevant, leading to inefficient storage and challenges in event retrieval. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an optimized video recording solution focused on activity detection. The proposed approach utilizes a hybrid method that combines motion detection via frame subtraction with object detection using YOLOv9. This strategy specifically targets the recording of scenes involving human or car activity, thereby reducing unnecessary footage and optimizing storage usage. The developed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving precision metrics of 0.855 for car detection and 0.884 for person detection, and reducing the storage requirements by two-thirds compared to traditional surveillance systems that rely solely on motion detection. This significant reduction in storage highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing surveillance system efficiency. Nonetheless, some limitations persist, particularly the occurrence of false positives and false negatives in adverse weather conditions, such as strong winds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven hierarchical approach to open set recognition (OSR) for robust perception in robotics and computer vision, utilizing constrained agglomerative clustering to automatically build a hierarchy of known classes in embedding space without requiring manual relational information. The method, demonstrated on the Animals with Attributes 2 (AwA2) dataset, achieves competitive results with an AUC ROC score of 0.82 and utility score of 0.85, while introducing two classification approaches (score-based and traversal-based) and a new Concentration Centrality (CC) metric for measuring hierarchical classification consistency. Although not surpassing existing models in accuracy, the approach provides valuable additional information about unknown classes through automatically generated hierarchies, requires no supplementary information beyond typical supervised model requirements, and introduces the Class Concentration Centrality (CCC) metric for evaluating unknown class placement consistency, with future work aimed at improving accuracy, validating the CC metric, and expanding to Large-Scale Open-Set Classification Protocols for ImageNet.</description>

Abstract: The classifier chain is a widely used method for analyzing multi-labeled data sets. In this study, we introduce a generalization of the classifier chain: the classifier chain network. The classifier chain network enables joint estimation of model parameters, and allows to account for the influence of earlier label predictions on subsequent classifiers in the chain. Through simulations, we evaluate the classifier chain network's performance against multiple benchmark methods, demonstrating competitive results even in scenarios that deviate from its modeling assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new measure for detecting conditional dependencies between labels and illustrate the classifier chain network's effectiveness using an empirical data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to detect departures from business-justified workflows among support agents. Our goal is to assist auditors in identifying agent actions that cannot be explained by the activity within their surrounding context, where normal activity patterns are established from historical data. We apply our method to help audit millions of actions of over three thousand support agents.
  We collect logs from the tools used by support agents and construct a bipartite graph of Actions and Entities representing all the actions of the agents, as well as background information about entities. From this graph, we sample subgraphs rooted on security-significant actions taken by the agents. Each subgraph captures the relevant context of the root action in terms of other actions, entities and their relationships. We then prioritize the rooted-subgraphs for auditor review using feed-forward and graph neural networks, as well as nearest neighbors techniques. To alleviate the issue of scarce labeling data, we use contrastive learning and domain-specific data augmentations.
  Expert auditors label the top ranked subgraphs as ``worth auditing" or ``not worth auditing" based on the company's business policies. This system finds subgraphs that are worth auditing with high enough precision to be used in production.</description>

      <title>Deep operator neural network applied to efficient computation of asteroid surface temperature and the Yarkovsky effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface temperature distribution is crucial for thermal property-based studies about irregular asteroids in our Solar System. While direct numerical simulations could model surface temperatures with high fidelity, they often take a significant amount of computational time, especially for problems where temperature distributions are required to be repeatedly calculated. To this end, deep operator neural network (DeepONet) provides a powerful tool due to its high computational efficiency and generalization ability. In this work, we applied DeepONet to the modelling of asteroid surface temperatures. Results show that the trained network is able to predict temperature with an accuracy of ~1% on average, while the computational cost is five orders of magnitude lower, hence enabling thermal property analysis in a multidimensional parameter space. As a preliminary application, we analyzed the orbital evolution of asteroids through direct N-body simulations embedded with instantaneous Yarkovsky effect inferred by DeepONet-based thermophysical modelling.Taking asteroids (3200) Phaethon and (89433) 2001 WM41 as examples, we show the efficacy and efficiency of our AI-based approach.</description>

      <title>Fair and Welfare-Efficient Constrained Multi-matchings under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fair allocation of constrained resources, where a market designer optimizes overall welfare while maintaining group fairness. In many large-scale settings, utilities are not known in advance, but are instead observed after realizing the allocation. We therefore estimate agent utilities using machine learning. Optimizing over estimates requires trading-off between mean utilities and their predictive variances. We discuss these trade-offs under two paradigms for preference modeling -- in the stochastic optimization regime, the market designer has access to a probability distribution over utilities, and in the robust optimization regime they have access to an uncertainty set containing the true utilities with high probability. We discuss utilitarian and egalitarian welfare objectives, and we explore how to optimize for them under stochastic and robust paradigms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches on three publicly available conference reviewer assignment datasets. The approaches presented enable scalable constrained resource allocation under uncertainty for many combinations of objectives and preference models.</description>

      <title>Pricing and Competition for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared to classical machine learning (ML) models, generative models offer a new usage paradigm where (i) a single model can be used for many different tasks out-of-the-box; (ii) users interact with this model over a series of natural language prompts; and (iii) the model is ideally evaluated on binary user satisfaction with respect to model outputs. Given these characteristics, we explore the problem of how developers of new generative AI software can release and price their technology. We first develop a comparison of two different models for a specific task with respect to user cost-effectiveness. We then model the pricing problem of generative AI software as a game between two different companies who sequentially release their models before users choose their preferred model for each task. Here, the price optimization problem becomes piecewise continuous where the companies must choose a subset of the tasks on which to be cost-effective and forgo revenue for the remaining tasks. In particular, we reveal the value of market information by showing that a company who deploys later after knowing their competitor's price can always secure cost-effectiveness on at least one task, whereas the company who is the first-to-market must price their model in a way that incentivizes higher prices from the latecomer in order to gain revenue. Most importantly, we find that if the different tasks are sufficiently similar, the first-to-market model may become cost-ineffective on all tasks regardless of how this technology is priced.</description>

      <title>A Trust-Region Algorithm for Noisy Equality Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modified Byrd-Omojokun (BO) trust region algorithm to address the challenges posed by noisy function and gradient evaluations. The original BO method was designed to solve equality constrained problems and it forms the backbone of some interior point methods for general large-scale constrained optimization. A key strength of the BO method is its robustness in handling problems with rank-deficient constraint Jacobians. The algorithm proposed in this paper introduces a new criterion for accepting a step and for updating the trust region that makes use of an estimate in the noise in the problem. The analysis presented here gives conditions under which the iterates converge to regions of stationary points of the problem, determined by the level of noise. This analysis is more complex than for line search methods because the trust region carries (noisy) information from previous iterates. Numerical tests illustrate the practical performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Visually Analyze SHAP Plots to Diagnose Misclassifications in ML-based Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection has been a commonly adopted detective security measures to safeguard systems and networks from various threats. A robust intrusion detection system (IDS) can essentially mitigate threats by providing alerts. In networks based IDS, typically we deal with cyber threats like distributed denial of service (DDoS), spoofing, reconnaissance, brute-force, botnets, and so on. In order to detect these threats various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have been proposed. However, one of the key challenges with these predictive approaches is the presence of false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) instances. This FPs and FNs within any black-box intrusion detection system (IDS) make the decision-making task of an analyst further complicated. In this paper, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based visual analysis approach using overlapping SHAP plots that presents the feature explanation to identify potential false positive and false negatives in IDS. Our approach can further provide guidance to security analysts for effective decision-making. We present case study with multiple publicly available network traffic datasets to showcase the efficacy of our approach for identifying false positive and false negative instances. Our use-case scenarios provide clear guidance for analysts on how to use the visual analysis approach for reliable course-of-actions against such threats.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal deformable image registration using untrained neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image registration techniques usually assume that the images to be registered are of a certain type (e.g. single- vs. multi-modal, 2D vs. 3D, rigid vs. deformable) and there lacks a general method that can work for data under all conditions. We propose a registration method that utilizes neural networks for image representation. Our method uses untrained networks with limited representation capacity as an implicit prior to guide for a good registration. Unlike previous approaches that are specialized for specific data types, our method handles both rigid and non-rigid, as well as single- and multi-modal registration, without requiring changes to the model or objective function. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation study using a variety of datasets and demonstrated promising performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent Augmented Reality (iAR): A Taxonomy of Context, an Architecture for iAR, and an Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) research have highlighted the critical role of context awareness in enhancing interface effectiveness and user experience. This underscores the need for intelligent AR (iAR) interfaces that dynamically adapt across various contexts to provide optimal experiences. In this paper, we (a) propose a comprehensive framework for context-aware inference and adaptation in iAR, (b) introduce a taxonomy that describes context through quantifiable input data, and (c) present an architecture that outlines the implementation of our proposed framework and taxonomy within iAR. Additionally, we present an empirical AR experiment to observe user behavior and record user performance, context, and user-specified adaptations to the AR interfaces within a context-switching scenario. We (d) explore the nuanced relationships between context and user adaptations in this scenario and discuss the significance of our framework in identifying these patterns. This experiment emphasizes the significance of context-awareness in iAR and provides a preliminary training dataset for this specific Scenario.</description>

      <title>Geometry of naturalistic object representations in recurrent neural network models of working memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory is a central cognitive ability crucial for intelligent decision-making. Recent experimental and computational work studying working memory has primarily used categorical (i.e., one-hot) inputs, rather than ecologically relevant, multidimensional naturalistic ones. Moreover, studies have primarily investigated working memory during single or few cognitive tasks. As a result, an understanding of how naturalistic object information is maintained in working memory in neural networks is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we developed sensory-cognitive models, comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) coupled with a recurrent neural network (RNN), and trained them on nine distinct N-back tasks using naturalistic stimuli. By examining the RNN's latent space, we found that: (1) Multi-task RNNs represent both task-relevant and irrelevant information simultaneously while performing tasks; (2) The latent subspaces used to maintain specific object properties in vanilla RNNs are largely shared across tasks, but highly task-specific in gated RNNs such as GRU and LSTM; (3) Surprisingly, RNNs embed objects in new representational spaces in which individual object features are less orthogonalized relative to the perceptual space; (4) The transformation of working memory encodings (i.e., embedding of visual inputs in the RNN latent space) into memory was shared across stimuli, yet the transformations governing the retention of a memory in the face of incoming distractor stimuli were distinct across time. Our findings indicate that goal-driven RNNs employ chronological memory subspaces to track information over short time spans, enabling testable predictions with neural data.</description>

      <title>On the loss of context-awareness in general instruction fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) require post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-response pairs to enable instruction following. However, this process can potentially harm existing capabilities learned during pretraining. In this paper, we investigate the loss of context awareness after SFT, defined as the capability to extract and understand information from the user-provided context and respond accordingly. We are the first to identify and show that the loss of context-awareness appears on instruction-finetuned LLMs when the chat template is applied to the input prompts. We identify the performance decline is partially caused by the bias embedded into the chat template to focus less on the user-provided context. Based on these observations, we propose two methods to mitigate the loss of context awareness in instruct models: post-hoc attention steering on user prompts and conditional instruction fine-tuning with a context-dependency indicator. Empirical experiments on 4 context-dependent downstream tasks and 3 pretrained LLMs of different sizes show that our methods effectively mitigates the loss of context awareness without compromising the general ability to follow instructions. Our findings also strongly advocate the necessity to carefully benchmark context awareness after instruction fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Point processes with event time uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point processes are widely used statistical models for uncovering the temporal patterns in dependent event data. In many applications, the event time cannot be observed exactly, calling for the incorporation of time uncertainty into the modeling of point process data. In this work, we introduce a framework to model time-uncertain point processes possibly on a network. We start by deriving the formulation in the continuous-time setting under a few assumptions motivated by application scenarios. After imposing a time grid, we obtain a discrete-time model that facilitates inference and can be computed by first-order optimization methods such as Gradient Descent or Variation inequality (VI) using batch-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The parameter recovery guarantee is proved for VI inference at an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate using $k$ SGD steps. Our framework handles non-stationary processes by modeling the inference kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network) and it covers the stationary process, such as the classical Hawkes process, as a special case. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous General Linear model (GLM) baselines on simulated and real data and reveals meaningful causal relations on a Sepsis-associated Derangements dataset.</description>

      <title>JEL: Applying End-to-End Neural Entity Linking in JPMorgan Chase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing key relationship among the entities of interest to enterprises and for integrating data from heterogeneous sources. JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) is leading this trend by leveraging knowledge graphs across the organization for multiple mission critical applications such as risk assessment, fraud detection, investment advice, etc. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph is to link mentions (e.g., company names) that are encountered in textual sources to entities in the knowledge graph. Although several techniques exist for entity linking, they are tuned for entities that exist in Wikipedia, and fail to generalize for the entities that are of interest to an enterprise. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural entity linking model (JEL) that uses minimal context information and a margin loss to generate entity embeddings, and a Wide &amp; Deep Learning model to match character and semantic information respectively. We show that JEL achieves the state-of-the-art performance to link mentions of company names in financial news with entities in our knowledge graph. We report on our efforts to deploy this model in the company-wide system to generate alerts in response to financial news. The methodology used for JEL is directly applicable and usable by other enterprises who need entity linking solutions for data that are unique to their respective situations.</description>

      <title>RT-Affordance: Affordances are Versatile Intermediate Representations for Robot Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how intermediate policy representations can facilitate generalization by providing guidance on how to perform manipulation tasks. Existing representations such as language, goal images, and trajectory sketches have been shown to be helpful, but these representations either do not provide enough context or provide over-specified context that yields less robust policies. We propose conditioning policies on affordances, which capture the pose of the robot at key stages of the task. Affordances offer expressive yet lightweight abstractions, are easy for users to specify, and facilitate efficient learning by transferring knowledge from large internet datasets. Our method, RT-Affordance, is a hierarchical model that first proposes an affordance plan given the task language, and then conditions the policy on this affordance plan to perform manipulation. Our model can flexibly bridge heterogeneous sources of supervision including large web datasets and robot trajectories. We additionally train our model on cheap-to-collect in-domain affordance images, allowing us to learn new tasks without collecting any additional costly robot trajectories. We show on a diverse set of novel tasks how RT-Affordance exceeds the performance of existing methods by over 50%, and we empirically demonstrate that affordances are robust to novel settings.

      <title>Full Field Digital Mammography Dataset from a Population Screening Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer presents the second largest cancer risk in the world to women. Early detection of cancer has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality. Population screening programs schedule regular mammography imaging for participants, promoting early detection. Currently, such screening programs require manual reading. False-positive errors in the reading process unnecessarily leads to costly follow-up and patient anxiety. Automated methods promise to provide more efficient, consistent and effective reading. To facilitate their development, a number of datasets have been created. With the aim of specifically targeting population screening programs, we introduce NL-Breast-Screening, a dataset from a Canadian provincial screening program. The dataset consists of 5997 mammography exams, each of which has four standard views and is biopsy-confirmed. Cases where radiologist reading was a false-positive are identified. NL-Breast is made publicly available as a new resource to promote advances in automation for population screening programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with Elliptical Wishart distributions - which generalize the Wishart distribution - in the context of signal processing and machine learning. Two algorithms to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are proposed: a fixed point algorithm and a Riemannian optimization method based on the derived information geometry of Elliptical Wishart distributions. The existence and uniqueness of the MLE are characterized as well as the convergence of both estimation algorithms. Statistical properties of the MLE are also investigated such as consistency, asymptotic normality and an intrinsic version of Fisher efficiency. On the statistical learning side, novel classification and clustering methods are designed. For the $t$-Wishart distribution, the performance of the MLE and statistical learning algorithms are evaluated on both simulated and real EEG and hyperspectral data, showcasing the interest of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>A Natural Language Processing Approach to Support Biomedical Data Harmonization: Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical research requires large, diverse samples to produce unbiased results. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can accelerate this process. Research in this area has been limited, primarily focusing on lexical matching and ontology based semantic matching. We aimed to develop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLM) and ensemble learning, to automate variable matching. Methods: We utilized data from two GERAS cohort (European and Japan) studies to develop variable matching methods. We first manually created a dataset by matching 352 EU variables with 1322 candidate JP variables, where matched variable pairs were positive and unmatched pairs were negative instances. Using this dataset, we developed and evaluated two types of natural language processing (NLP) methods, which matched variables based on variable labels and definitions from data dictionaries: (1) LLM-based and (2) fuzzy matching. We then developed an ensemble-learning method, using the Random Forest model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF was trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of training and test sets, with the model's hyperparameters optimized through cross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP variables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF's probability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking performance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HRn) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Results:E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.90 HR-30 and 0.70 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P less than 0.001) and achieved an average HR 30 of 0.98 and MRR of 0.73. LLM-derived features contributed most to RF's performance. One major cause of errors in automatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions within data dictionaries.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1) is of significant theoretical and practical interest due to its computational advantages in certain problems, despite its subuniversality with limited quantum resources. In this work, we introduce parameterized DQC1 as a quantum machine learning model. We demonstrate that the gradient of the measurement outcome of a DQC1 circuit with respect to its gate parameters can be computed directly using the DQC1 protocol. This allows for gradient-based optimization of DQC1 circuits, positioning DQC1 as the sole quantum protocol for both training and inference. We then analyze the expressivity of the parameterized DQC1 circuits, characterizing the set of learnable functions, and show that DQC1-based machine learning (ML) is as powerful as quantum neural networks based on universal computation. Our findings highlight the potential of DQC1 as a practical and versatile platform for ML, capable of rivaling more complex quantum computing models while utilizing simpler quantum resources.</description>

      <title>DEMONet: Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition based on Multi-Expert Network and Cross-Temporal Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a robust underwater acoustic recognition system in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the complex underwater environment and the dynamic motion states of targets. A promising optimization approach is to leverage the intrinsic physical characteristics of targets, which remain invariable regardless of environmental conditions, to provide robust insights. However, our study reveals that while physical characteristics exhibit robust properties, they may lack class-specific discriminative patterns. Consequently, directly incorporating physical characteristics into model training can potentially introduce unintended inductive biases, leading to performance degradation. To utilize the benefits of physical characteristics while mitigating possible detrimental effects, we propose DEMONet in this study, which utilizes the detection of envelope modulation on noise (DEMON) to provide robust insights into the shaft frequency or blade counts of targets. DEMONet is a multi-expert network that allocates various underwater signals to their best-matched expert layer based on DEMON spectra for fine-grained signal processing. Thereinto, DEMON spectra are solely responsible for providing implicit physical characteristics without establishing a mapping relationship with the target category. Furthermore, to mitigate noise and spurious modulation spectra in DEMON features, we introduce a cross-temporal alignment strategy and employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct noise-resistant DEMON spectra to replace the raw DEMON features. The effectiveness of the proposed DEMONet with cross-temporal VAE was primarily evaluated on the DeepShip dataset and our proprietary datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</description>

      <title>Fast, robust approximate message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a fast, spectral procedure for implementing approximate-message passing (AMP) algorithms robustly. For any quadratic optimization problem over symmetric matrices $X$ with independent subgaussian entries, and any separable AMP algorithm $\mathcal A$, our algorithm performs a spectral pre-processing step and then mildly modifies the iterates of $\mathcal A$. If given the perturbed input $X + E \in \mathbb R^{n \times n}$ for any $E$ supported on a $\varepsilon n \times \varepsilon n$ principal minor, our algorithm outputs a solution $\hat v$ which is guaranteed to be close to the output of $\mathcal A$ on the uncorrupted $X$, with $\|\mathcal A(X) - \hat v\|_2 \le f(\varepsilon) \|\mathcal A(X)\|_2$ where $f(\varepsilon) \to 0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ depending only on $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Generalization and Risk Bounds for Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved great success in the prediction of sequential data. However, their theoretical studies are still lagging behind because of their complex interconnected structures. In this paper, we establish a new generalization error bound for vanilla RNNs, and provide a unified framework to calculate the Rademacher complexity that can be applied to a variety of loss functions. When the ramp loss is used, we show that our bound is tighter than the existing bounds based on the same assumptions on the Frobenius and spectral norms of the weight matrices and a few mild conditions. Our numerical results show that our new generalization bound is the tightest among all existing bounds in three public datasets. Our bound improves the second tightest one by an average percentage of 13.80% and 3.01% when the $\tanh$ and ReLU activation functions are used, respectively. Moreover, we derive a sharp estimation error bound for RNN-based estimators obtained through empirical risk minimization (ERM) in multi-class classification problems when the loss function satisfies a Bernstein condition.</description>

      <title>Advancing Robust Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition through Multi-task Learning and Multi-Gate Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition has emerged as a prominent research area within the field of underwater acoustics. However, the current availability of authentic underwater acoustic signal recordings remains limited, which hinders data-driven acoustic recognition models from learning robust patterns of targets from a limited set of intricate underwater signals, thereby compromising their stability in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a recognition framework called M3 (Multi-task, Multi-gate, Multi-expert) to enhance the model's ability to capture robust patterns by making it aware of the inherent properties of targets. In this framework, an auxiliary task that focuses on target properties, such as estimating target size, is designed. The auxiliary task then shares parameters with the recognition task to realize multi-task learning. This paradigm allows the model to concentrate on shared information across tasks and identify robust patterns of targets in a regularized manner, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability. Moreover, M3 incorporates multi-expert and multi-gate mechanisms, allowing for the allocation of distinct parameter spaces to various underwater signals. This enables the model to process intricate signal patterns in a fine-grained and differentiated manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of M3, extensive experiments were implemented on the ShipsEar underwater ship-radiated noise dataset. The results substantiate that M3 has the ability to outperform the most advanced single-task recognition models, thereby achieving the state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Language Models and Cycle Consistency for Self-Reflective Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT). We start with one conjecture: an ideal translation should contain complete and accurate information for a strong enough LLM to recover the original sentence. We generate multiple translation candidates from a source language A to a target language B, and subsequently translate these candidates back to the original language A. By evaluating the cycle consistency between the original and back-translated sentences using metrics such as token-level precision and accuracy, we implicitly estimate the translation quality in language B, without knowing its ground-truth. This also helps to evaluate the LLM translation capability, only with monolingual corpora. For each source sentence, we identify the translation candidate with optimal cycle consistency with the original sentence as the final answer. Our experiments demonstrate that larger LLMs, or the same LLM with more forward passes during inference, exhibit increased cycle consistency, aligning with the LLM model size scaling law and test-time computation scaling law. This work provide methods for, 1) to implicitly evaluate translation quality of a sentence in the target language, 2), to evaluate capability of LLM for any-to-any-language translation, and 3), how to generate a better translation for a specific LLM.</description>

      <title>DroidSpeak: Enhancing Cross-LLM Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), communication between agents traditionally relies on natural language. This communication often includes the full context of the query so far, which can introduce significant prefill-phase latency, especially with long contexts.
  We introduce DroidSpeak, a novel framework to target this cross-LLM communication by leveraging the reuse of intermediate data, such as input embeddings (E-cache) and key-value caches (KV-cache). We efficiently bypass the need to reprocess entire contexts for fine-tuned versions of the same foundational model. This approach allows faster context integration while maintaining the quality of task performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DroidSpeak's ability to significantly accelerate inter-agent communication, achieving up to a 2.78x speedup in prefill latency with negligible loss in accuracy. Our findings underscore the potential to create more efficient and scalable multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>CE-CoLLM: Efficient and Adaptive Large Language Models Through Cloud-Edge Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in serving end-users with human-like intelligence. However, LLMs demand high computational resources, making it challenging to deploy them to satisfy various performance objectives, such as meeting the resource constraints on edge devices close to end-users or achieving high accuracy with ample resources. In this paper, we introduce CE-CoLLM, a novel cloud-edge collaboration framework that supports efficient and adaptive LLM inference for end-users at the edge with two modes, (1) low-latency edge standalone inference and (2) highly accurate cloud-edge collaborative inference. First, we show that the inherent high communication costs for transmitting LLM contextual information between the edge and cloud dominate the overall latency, making it inefficient and costly to deploy LLMs using cloud-edge collaboration. Second, we propose several critical techniques to address this challenge, including early-exit mechanism, cloud context manager, and quantization in cloud-edge collaboration to enable not only low-latency standalone edge inference but also efficient and adaptive cloud-edge collaborative inference for LLMs. Third, we perform comprehensive experimental analysis, which demonstrates that CE-CoLLM significantly reduces inference time by up to 13.81% and cloud computation costs by up to 84.55% compared to the popular cloud-based LLM deployment, while maintaining comparable model accuracy. The proposed approach effectively shifts the computational load to the edge, reduces the communication overhead, scales efficiently with multiple edge clients, and provides reliable LLM deployment using cloud-edge collaboration.</description>

      <title>Mixtures of In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) adapts LLMs by providing demonstrations without fine-tuning the model parameters; however, it does not differentiate between demonstrations and quadratically increases the complexity of Transformer LLMs, exhausting the memory. As a solution, we propose Mixtures of In-Context Learners (MoICL), a novel approach to treat subsets of demonstrations as experts and learn a weighting function to merge their output distributions based on a training set. In our experiments, we show performance improvements on 5 out of 7 classification datasets compared to a set of strong baselines (up to +13\% compared to ICL and LENS). Moreover, we enhance the Pareto frontier of ICL by reducing the inference time needed to achieve the same performance with fewer demonstrations. Finally, MoICL is more robust to out-of-domain (up to +11\%), imbalanced (up to +49\%), or noisy demonstrations (up to +38\%) or can filter these out from datasets. Overall, MoICL is a more expressive approach to learning from demonstrations without exhausting the context window or memory.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Object Detection Performance with Visual Saliency and Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As object detection techniques continue to evolve, understanding their relationships with complementary visual tasks becomes crucial for optimising model architectures and computational resources. This paper investigates the correlations between object detection accuracy and two fundamental visual tasks: depth prediction and visual saliency prediction. Through comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything, DPT-Large, and Itti's model) on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, we find that visual saliency shows consistently stronger correlations with object detection accuracy (mA$\rho$ up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) compared to depth prediction (mA$\rho$ up to 0.283). Our analysis reveals significant variations in these correlations across object categories, with larger objects showing correlation values up to three times higher than smaller objects. These findings suggest incorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures could be more beneficial than depth information, particularly for specific object categories. The observed category-specific variations also provide insights for targeted feature engineering and dataset design improvements, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate object detection systems.</description>

      <title>Adversarial multi-task underwater acoustic target recognition: towards robustness against various influential factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic target recognition based on passive sonar faces numerous challenges in practical maritime applications. One of the main challenges lies in the susceptibility of signal characteristics to diverse environmental conditions and data acquisition configurations, which can lead to instability in recognition systems. While significant efforts have been dedicated to addressing these influential factors in other domains of underwater acoustics, they are often neglected in the field of underwater acoustic target recognition. To overcome this limitation, this study designs auxiliary tasks that model influential factors (e.g., source range, water column depth, or wind speed) based on available annotations and adopts a multi-task framework to connect these factors to the recognition task. Furthermore, we integrate an adversarial learning mechanism into the multi-task framework to prompt the model to extract representations that are robust against influential factors. Through extensive experiments and analyses on the ShipsEar dataset, our proposed adversarial multi-task model demonstrates its capacity to effectively model the influential factors and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the 12-class recognition task.</description>

      <title>SpiDR: A Reconfigurable Digital Compute-in-Memory Spiking Neural Network Accelerator for Event-based Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their inherent recurrence, offer an efficient method for processing the asynchronous temporal data generated by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), making them well-suited for event-based vision applications. However, existing SNN accelerators suffer from limitations in adaptability to diverse neuron models, bit precisions and network sizes, inefficient membrane potential (Vmem) handling, and limited sparse optimizations. In response to these challenges, we propose a scalable and reconfigurable digital compute-in-memory (CIM) SNN accelerator \chipname with a set of key features: 1) It uses in-memory computations and reconfigurable operating modes to minimize data movement associated with weight and Vmem data structures while efficiently adapting to different workloads. 2) It supports multiple weight/Vmem bit precision values, enabling a trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency and enhancing adaptability to diverse application demands. 3) A zero-skipping mechanism for sparse inputs significantly reduces energy usage by leveraging the inherent sparsity of spikes without introducing high overheads for low sparsity. 4) Finally, the asynchronous handshaking mechanism maintains the computational efficiency of the pipeline for variable execution times of different computation units. We fabricated \chipname in 65 nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) low-power (LP) technology. It demonstrates competitive performance (scaled to the same technology node) to other digital SNN accelerators proposed in the recent literature and supports advanced reconfigurability. It achieves up to 5 TOPS/W energy efficiency at 95% input sparsity with 4-bit weights and 7-bit Vmem precision.</description>

      <title>Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task, aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving performance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This problem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models, making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep (\textbf{Cont}inual \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{V}isual Sound \textbf{Sep}aration). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seamlessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation.

Abstract: Recent work in database query optimization has used complex machine learning strategies, such as customized reinforcement learning schemes. Surprisingly, we show that LLM embeddings of query text contain useful semantic information for query optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple binary classifier deciding between alternative query plans, trained only on a small number of labeled embedded query vectors, can outperform existing heuristic systems. Although we only present some preliminary results, an LLM-powered query optimizer could provide significant benefits, both in terms of performance and simplicity.</description>

      <title>TokenSelect: Efficient Long-Context Inference and Length Extrapolation for LLMs via Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), the ability to handle longer contexts has become a key capability for Web applications such as cross-document understanding and LLM-powered search systems. However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28x acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLLMs) exhibit promising capabilities for processing multi-modal tasks across various application scenarios. However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression: A Distribution-Free Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions on the training data, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Graph-Based Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption for Collaborative Anti-Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combating money laundering has become increasingly complex with the rise of cybercrime and digitalization of financial transactions. Graph-based machine learning techniques have emerged as promising tools for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection, capturing intricate relationships within money laundering networks. However, the effectiveness of AML solutions is hindered by data silos within financial institutions, limiting collaboration and overall efficacy. This research presents a novel privacy-preserving approach for collaborative AML machine learning, facilitating secure data sharing across institutions and borders while preserving privacy and regulatory compliance. Leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), computations are directly performed on encrypted data, ensuring the confidentiality of financial data. Notably, FHE over the Torus (TFHE) was integrated with graph-based machine learning using Zama Concrete ML. The research contributes two key privacy-preserving pipelines. First, the development of a privacy-preserving Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline was explored. Optimization techniques like quantization and pruning were used to render the GNN FHE-compatible. Second, a privacy-preserving graph-based XGBoost pipeline leveraging Graph Feature Preprocessor (GFP) was successfully developed. Experiments demonstrated strong predictive performance, with the XGBoost model consistently achieving over 99% accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall on the balanced AML dataset in both unencrypted and FHE-encrypted inference settings. On the imbalanced dataset, the incorporation of graph-based features improved the F1-score by 8%. The research highlights the need to balance the trade-off between privacy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Textual Aesthetics in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image aesthetics is a crucial metric in the field of image generation. However, textual aesthetics has not been sufficiently explored. With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), previous work has primarily focused on the correctness of content and the helpfulness of responses. Nonetheless, providing responses with textual aesthetics is also an important factor for LLMs, which can offer a cleaner layout and ensure greater consistency and coherence in content. In this work, we introduce a pipeline for aesthetics polishing and help construct a textual aesthetics dataset named TexAes. We propose a textual aesthetics-powered fine-tuning method based on direct preference optimization, termed TAPO, which leverages textual aesthetics without compromising content correctness. Additionally, we develop two evaluation methods for textual aesthetics based on text and image analysis, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that using textual aesthetics data and employing the TAPO fine-tuning method not only improves aesthetic scores but also enhances performance on general evaluation datasets such as AlpacalEval and Anera-hard.</description>

      <title>P-MOSS: Learned Scheduling For Indexes Over NUMA Servers Using Low-Level Hardware Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ever since the Dennard scaling broke down in the early 2000s and the frequency of the CPU stalled, vendors have started to increase the core count in each CPU chip at the expense of introducing heterogeneity, thus ushering the era of NUMA processors. Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries are scheduled, and the locations of the data that the queries access. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to certain logical cores, and places data accordingly to certain integrated memory controllers (IMC), to integrate hardware consciousness into the system. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS solely guides its scheduling decision based on low-level hardware statistics collected by performance monitoring counters with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B-tree and R-tree indexes. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS has up to 6x improvement over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</description>

      <title>Mapping Africa Settlements: High Resolution Urban and Rural Map by Deep Learning and Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are essential for understanding the drivers of sustainable development, in terms of its complex interrelationships between human activities and natural resources. However, existing LULC maps often lack precise urban and rural classifications, particularly in diverse regions like Africa. This study presents a novel construction of a high-resolution rural-urban map using deep learning techniques and satellite imagery. We developed a deep learning model based on the DeepLabV3 architecture, which was trained on satellite imagery from Landsat-8 and the ESRI LULC dataset, augmented with human settlement data from the GHS-SMOD. The model utilizes semantic segmentation to classify land into detailed categories, including urban and rural areas, at a 10-meter resolution. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating LULC along with urban and rural classifications significantly enhances the model's ability to accurately distinguish between urban, rural, and non-human settlement areas. Therefore, our maps can support more informed decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. We release a continent wide urban-rural map, covering the period 2016 and 2022.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into the continuous post-training optimization methods for small language models, and proposes a continuous post-training alignment data construction method for small language models. The core of this method is based on the data guidance of large models, optimizing the diversity and accuracy of alignment data. In addition, to verify the effectiveness of the methods in this paper, we used Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct model as the baseline model for small language models, using the alignment dataset constructed by our proposed method, we trained and compared several groups of experiments, including SFT (Supervised Fine Tuning) post-training experiment and KTO (Kahneman Tversky optimization) post-training experiment, as well as SFT-KTO two-stage post-training experiment and model weight fusion experiment. Finally, we evaluated and analyzed the performance of post-training models, and confirmed that the continuous post-training optimization method proposed by us can significantly improve the performance of small language models.</description>

      <title>Speaker Emotion Recognition: Leveraging Self-Supervised Models for Feature Extraction Using Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. Identifying emotion from speech is a nontrivial task due to the ambiguous definition of emotion itself. Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for understanding human emotional behavior. The SER task is challenging due to the variety of speakers, background noise, complexity of emotions, and speaking styles. It has many applications in education, healthcare, customer service, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Previously, conventional machine learning methods such as SVM, HMM, and KNN have been used for the SER task. In recent years, deep learning methods have become popular, with convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks being used for SER tasks. The input of these methods is mostly spectrograms and hand-crafted features. In this work, we study the use of self-supervised transformer-based models, Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT, to determine the emotion of speakers from their voice. The models automatically extract features from raw audio signals, which are then used for the classification task. The proposed solution is evaluated on reputable datasets, including RAVDESS, SHEMO, SAVEE, AESDD, and Emo-DB. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method on different datasets. Moreover, the model has been used for real-world applications like call center conversations, and the results demonstrate that the model accurately predicts emotions.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Fault-Tolerant Control for Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Knowledge Distillation and In-Context Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based approach for fault-tolerant control in fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to adapt in real time to dynamic changes caused by structural damage or actuator failures. Unlike traditional Flight Control Systems (FCSs) that rely on classical control theory and struggle under severe alterations in dynamics, our method directly maps outer-loop reference values -- altitude, heading, and airspeed -- into control commands using the in-context learning and attention mechanisms of transformers, thus bypassing inner-loop controllers and fault-detection layers. Employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, the proposed approach trains a student agent with partial observations by transferring knowledge from a privileged expert agent with full observability, enabling robust performance across diverse failure scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based controller outperforms industry-standard FCS and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods, maintaining high tracking accuracy and stability in nominal conditions and extreme failure cases, highlighting its potential for enhancing UAV operational safety and reliability.</description>

      <title>Sparse Reconstruction of Wavefronts using an Over-Complete Phase Dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavefront reconstruction is a critical component in various optical systems, including adaptive optics, interferometry, and phase contrast imaging. Traditional reconstruction methods often employ either the Cartesian (pixel) basis or the Zernike polynomial basis. While the Cartesian basis is adept at capturing high-frequency features, it is susceptible to overfitting and inefficiencies due to the high number of degrees of freedom. The Zernike basis efficiently represents common optical aberrations but struggles with complex or non-standard wavefronts such as optical vortices, Bessel beams, or wavefronts with sharp discontinuities. This paper introduces a novel approach to wavefront reconstruction using an over-complete phase dictionary combined with sparse representation techniques. By constructing a dictionary that includes a diverse set of basis functions - ranging from Zernike polynomials to specialized functions representing optical vortices and other complex modes - we enable a more flexible and efficient representation of complex wavefronts. Furthermore, a trainable affine transform is implemented to account for misalignment. Utilizing principles from compressed sensing and sparse coding, we enforce sparsity in the coefficient space to avoid overfitting and enhance robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>PV-faultNet: Optimized CNN Architecture to detect defects resulting efficient PV production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global shift towards renewable energy has pushed PV cell manufacturing as a pivotal point as they are the fundamental building block of green energy. However, the manufacturing process is complex enough to lose its purpose due to probable defects experienced during the time impacting the overall efficiency. However, at the moment, manual inspection is being conducted to detect the defects that can cause bias, leading to time and cost inefficiency. Even if automated solutions have also been proposed, most of them are resource-intensive, proving ineffective in production environments. In that context, this study presents PV-faultNet, a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture optimized for efficient and real-time defect detection in photovoltaic (PV) cells, designed to be deployable on resource-limited production devices. Addressing computational challenges in industrial PV manufacturing environments, the model includes only 2.92 million parameters, significantly reducing processing demands without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive data augmentation techniques were implemented to tackle data scarcity, thus enhancing model generalization and maintaining a balance between precision and recall. The proposed model achieved high performance with 91\% precision, 89\% recall, and a 90\% F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable quality control in PV production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating reinforcement learning agents that generalise effectively to new tasks is a key challenge in AI research. This paper introduces Fracture Cluster Options (FraCOs), a multi-level hierarchical reinforcement learning method that achieves state-of-the-art performance on difficult generalisation tasks. FraCOs identifies patterns in agent behaviour and forms options based on the expected future usefulness of those patterns, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. In tabular settings, FraCOs demonstrates effective transfer and improves performance as it grows in hierarchical depth. We evaluate FraCOs against state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms in several complex procedurally generated environments. Our results show that FraCOs achieves higher in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance than competitors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$, a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry. To this end, we propose the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)=\min\{\mathrm{xc}(Q)+\mathrm{xc}(R)\mid P+Q=R\}$. This generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of a neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains open to derive strong lower bounds on virtual extension complexity, we show that powerful results on the ordinary extension complexity can be converted into lower bounds for monotone neural networks, that is, neural networks with only nonnegative weights. Furthermore, we show that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation. We therefore believe that virtual extension complexity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks, just like the ordinary extension complexity. As a first step in this direction, we derive an example showing that extension complexity can go down under Minkowski sum.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: Compression is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.</description>

      <title>Blending Ensemble for Classification with Genetic-algorithm generated Alpha factors and Sentiments (GAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03035</link>

Abstract: With the increasing maturity and expansion of the cryptocurrency market, understanding and predicting its price fluctuations has become an important issue in the field of financial engineering. This article introduces an innovative Genetic Algorithm-generated Alpha Sentiment (GAS) blending ensemble model specifically designed to predict Bitcoin market trends. The model integrates advanced ensemble learning methods, feature selection algorithms, and in-depth sentiment analysis to effectively capture the complexity and variability of daily Bitcoin trading data. The GAS framework combines 34 Alpha factors with 8 news economic sentiment factors to provide deep insights into Bitcoin price fluctuations by accurately analyzing market sentiment and technical indicators. The core of this study is using a stacked model (including LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest Classifier) for trend prediction which demonstrates excellent performance in traditional buy-and-hold strategies. In addition, this article also explores the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms to automate alpha factor construction as well as enhancing predictive models through sentiment analysis. Experimental results show that the GAS model performs competitively in daily Bitcoin trend prediction especially when analyzing highly volatile financial assets with rich data.</description>

      <title>Speech Separation with Pretrained Frontend to Minimize Domain Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech separation seeks to separate individual speech signals from a speech mixture. Typically, most separation models are trained on synthetic data due to the unavailability of target reference in real-world cocktail party scenarios. As a result, there exists a domain gap between real and synthetic data when deploying speech separation models in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised domain-invariant pretrained (DIP) frontend that is exposed to mixture data without the need for target reference speech. The DIP frontend utilizes a Siamese network with two innovative pretext tasks, mixture predictive coding (MPC) and mixture invariant coding (MIC), to capture shared contextual cues between real and synthetic unlabeled mixtures. Subsequently, we freeze the DIP frontend as a feature extractor when training the downstream speech separation models on synthetic data. By pretraining the DIP frontend with the contextual cues, we expect that the speech separation skills learned from synthetic data can be effectively transferred to real data. To benefit from the DIP frontend, we introduce a novel separation pipeline to align the feature resolution of the separation models. We evaluate the speech separation quality on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets. The results confirm the superiority of our DIP frontend over existing speech separation models. This study underscores the potential of large-scale pretraining to enhance the quality and intelligibility of speech separation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Correlating Variational Autoencoders Natively For Multi-View Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-view data from the same source often exhibit correlation. This is mirrored in correlation between the latent spaces of separate variational autoencoders (VAEs) trained on each data-view. A multi-view VAE approach is proposed that incorporates a joint prior with a non-zero correlation structure between the latent spaces of the VAEs. By enforcing such correlation structure, more strongly correlated latent spaces are uncovered. Using conditional distributions to move between these latent spaces, missing views can be imputed and used for downstream analysis. Learning this correlation structure involves maintaining validity of the prior distribution, as well as a successful parameterization that allows end-to-end learning.</description>

      <title>Local Lesion Generation is Effective for Capsule Endoscopy Image Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further enhances the results.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Machine Learning Models against Clinical Protocols for Enhanced Interpretability and Continuity of Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clinical practice, decision-making relies heavily on established protocols, often formalised as rules. Concurrently, Machine Learning (ML) models, trained on clinical data, aspire to integrate into medical decision-making processes. However, despite the growing number of ML applications, their adoption into clinical practice remains limited. Two critical concerns arise, relevant to the notions of consistency and continuity of care: (a) accuracy - the ML model, albeit more accurate, might introduce errors that would not have occurred by applying the protocol; (b) interpretability - ML models operating as black boxes might make predictions based on relationships that contradict established clinical knowledge. In this context, the literature suggests using ML models integrating domain knowledge for improved accuracy and interpretability. However, there is a lack of appropriate metrics for comparing ML models with clinical rules in addressing these challenges. Accordingly, in this article, we first propose metrics to assess the accuracy of ML models with respect to the established protocol. Secondly, we propose an approach to measure the distance of explanations provided by two rule sets, with the goal of comparing the explanation similarity between clinical rule-based systems and rules extracted from ML models. The approach is validated on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset by training two neural networks - one exclusively on data, and the other integrating a clinical protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the integrated ML model achieves comparable performance to that of a fully data-driven model while exhibiting superior accuracy relative to the clinical protocol, ensuring enhanced continuity of care. Furthermore, we show that our integrated model provides explanations for predictions that align more closely with the clinical protocol compared to the data-driven model.</description>

      <title>User Centric Semantic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current studies on semantic communications mainly focus on efficiently extracting semantic information to reduce bandwidth usage between a transmitter and a user. Although significant process has been made in the semantic communications, a fundamental design problem is that the semantic information is extracted based on certain criteria at the transmitter side along, without considering the user's actual requirements. As a result, critical information that is of primary concern to the user may be lost. In such cases, the semantic transmission becomes meaningless to the user, as all received information is irrelevant to the user's interests. To solve this problem, this paper presents a user centric semantic communication system, where the user sends its request for the desired semantic information to the transmitter at the start of each transmission. Then, the transmitter extracts the required semantic information accordingly. A key challenge is how the transmitter can understand the user's requests for semantic information and extract the required semantic information in a reasonable and robust manner. We solve this challenge by designing a well-structured framework and leveraging off-the-shelf products, such as GPT-4, along with several specialized tools for detection and estimation. Evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed user centric semantic communication system.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the power of novel conditional generative approaches for new materials discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a very long time, computational approaches to the design of new materials have relied on an iterative process of finding a candidate material and modeling its properties. AI has played a crucial role in this regard, helping to accelerate the discovery and optimization of crystal properties and structures through advanced computational methodologies and data-driven approaches. To address the problem of new materials design and fasten the process of new materials search, we have applied latest generative approaches to the problem of crystal structure design, trying to solve the inverse problem: by given properties generate a structure that satisfies them without utilizing supercomputer powers. In our work we propose two approaches: 1) conditional structure modification: optimization of the stability of an arbitrary atomic configuration, using the energy difference between the most energetically favorable structure and all its less stable polymorphs and 2) conditional structure generation. We used a representation for materials that includes the following information: lattice, atom coordinates, atom types, chemical features, space group and formation energy of the structure. The loss function was optimized to take into account the periodic boundary conditions of crystal structures. We have applied Diffusion models approach, Flow matching, usual Autoencoder (AE) and compared the results of the models and approaches. As a metric for the study, physical PyMatGen matcher was employed: we compare target structure with generated one using default tolerances. So far, our modifier and generator produce structures with needed properties with accuracy 41% and 82% respectively. To prove the offered methodology efficiency, inference have been carried out, resulting in several potentially new structures with formation energy below the AFLOW-derived convex hulls.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian, structure and trace distance learning of Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of Hamiltonian learning for positive temperature bosonic Gaussian states, the quantum generalization of the widely studied problem of learning Gaussian graphical models. We obtain efficient protocols, both in sample and computational complexity, for the task of inferring the parameters of their underlying quadratic Hamiltonian under the assumption of bounded temperature, squeezing, displacement and maximal degree of the interaction graph. Our protocol only requires heterodyne measurements, which are often experimentally feasible, and has a sample complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of modes. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to learn the underlying interaction graph in a similar setting and sample complexity. Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a much more advanced state when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either unavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our techniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace distance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of modes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main technical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and Hamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest, combined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local inversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian state by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose size scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way we bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix, controlling the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Pre-trained Visual Dynamics Representations for Efficient Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training for Reinforcement Learning (RL) with purely video data is a valuable yet challenging problem. Although in-the-wild videos are readily available and inhere a vast amount of prior world knowledge, the absence of action annotations and the common domain gap with downstream tasks hinder utilizing videos for RL pre-training. To address the challenge of pre-training with videos, we propose Pre-trained Visual Dynamics Representations (PVDR) to bridge the domain gap between videos and downstream tasks for efficient policy learning. By adopting video prediction as a pre-training task, we use a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn visual dynamics representations. The pre-trained visual dynamics representations capture the visual dynamics prior knowledge in the videos. This abstract prior knowledge can be readily adapted to downstream tasks and aligned with executable actions through online adaptation. We conduct experiments on a series of robotics visual control tasks and verify that PVDR is an effective form for pre-training with videos to promote policy learning.</description>

      <title>Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.</description>

      <title>Insights into Lunar Mineralogy: An Unsupervised Approach for Clustering of the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for mapping spectral features of the Moon using machine learning-based clustering of hyperspectral data from the Moon Mineral Mapper (M3) imaging spectrometer. The method uses a convolutional variational autoencoder to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and extract features of the spectra. Then, a k-means algorithm is applied to cluster the latent variables into five distinct groups, corresponding to dominant spectral features, which are related to the mineral composition of the Moon's surface. The resulting global spectral cluster map shows the distribution of the five clusters on the Moon, which consist of a mixture of, among others, plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and Fe-bearing minerals across the Moon's surface. The clusters are compared to the mineral maps from the Kaguya mission, which showed that the locations of the clusters overlap with the locations of high wt% of minerals such as plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and olivine. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of unbiased unsupervised learning for lunar mineral exploration and provides a comprehensive analysis of lunar mineralogy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many works have studied statistical data fusion, they typically assume that the various datasets are given in advance. However, in practice, estimation requires difficult data collection decisions like determining the available data sources, their costs, and how many samples to collect from each source. Moreover, this process is often sequential because the data collected at a given time can improve collection decisions in the future. In our setup, given access to multiple data sources and budget constraints, the agent must sequentially decide which data source to query to efficiently estimate a target parameter. We formalize this task using Online Moment Selection, a semiparametric framework that applies to any parameter identified by a set of moment conditions. Interestingly, the optimal budget allocation depends on the (unknown) true parameters. We present two online data collection policies, Explore-then-Commit and Explore-then-Greedy, that use the parameter estimates at a given time to optimally allocate the remaining budget in the future steps. We prove that both policies achieve zero regret (assessed by asymptotic MSE) relative to an oracle policy. We empirically validate our methods on both synthetic and real-world causal effect estimation tasks, demonstrating that the online data collection policies outperform their fixed counterparts.</description>

Abstract: What if the main data protection vulnerability is risk management? Data Protection merges three disciplines: data protection law, information security, and risk management. Nonetheless, very little research has been made on the field of data protection risk management, where subjectivity and superficiality are the dominant state of the art. Since the GDPR tells you what to do, but not how to do it, the solution for approaching GDPR compliance is still a gray zone, where the trend is using the rule of thumb. Considering that the most important goal of risk management is to reduce uncertainty in order to take informed decisions, risk management for the protection of the rights and freedoms of the data subjects cannot be disconnected from the impact materialization that data controllers and processors need to assess. This paper proposes a quantitative approach to data protection risk-based compliance from a data controllers perspective, with the aim of proposing a mindset change, where data protection impact assessments can be improved by using data protection analytics, quantitative risk analysis, and calibrating expert opinions.</description>

      <title>Kernel Orthogonality does not necessarily imply a Decrease in Feature Map Redundancy in CNNs: Convolutional Similarity Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been heavily used in Deep Learning due to their success in various tasks. Nonetheless, it has been observed that CNNs suffer from redundancy in feature maps, leading to inefficient capacity utilization. Efforts to mitigate and solve this problem led to the emergence of multiple methods, amongst which is kernel orthogonality through variant means. In this work, we challenge the common belief that kernel orthogonality leads to a decrease in feature map redundancy, which is, supposedly, the ultimate objective behind kernel orthogonality. We prove, theoretically and empirically, that kernel orthogonality has an unpredictable effect on feature map similarity and does not necessarily decrease it. Based on our theoretical result, we propose an effective method to reduce feature map similarity independently of the input of the CNN. This is done by minimizing a novel loss function we call Convolutional Similarity. Empirical results show that minimizing the Convolutional Similarity increases the performance of classification models and can accelerate their convergence. Furthermore, using our proposed method pushes towards a more efficient use of the capacity of models, allowing the use of significantly smaller models to achieve the same levels of performance.</description>

      <title>Topograph: An efficient Graph-Based Framework for Strictly Topology Preserving Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.</description>

      <title>On the Detection of Non-Cooperative RISs: Scan B-Testing via Deep Support Vector Data Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of promptly detecting the presence of non-cooperative activity from one or more Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) with unknown characteristics lying in the vicinity of a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication system using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. We first present a novel wideband channel model incorporating RISs as well as non-reconfigurable stationary surfaces, which captures both the effect of the RIS actuation time on the channel in the frequency domain as well as the difference between changing phase configurations during or among transmissions. Considering that RISs may operate under the coordination of a third-party system, and thus, may negatively impact the communication of the intended MIMO OFDM system, we present a novel RIS activity detection framework that is unaware of the distribution of the phase configuration of any of the non-cooperative RISs. In particular, capitalizing on the knowledge of the data distribution at the multi-antenna receiver, we design a novel online change point detection statistic that combines a deep support vector data description model with the scan $B$-test. The presented numerical investigations demonstrate the improved detection accuracy as well as decreased computational complexity of the proposed RIS detection approach over existing change point detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Stable Matching with Ties: Approximation Ratios and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of matching markets with ties, where one side of the market does not necessarily have strict preferences over members at its other side. For example, workers do not always have strict preferences over jobs, students can give the same ranking for different schools and more. In particular, assume w.l.o.g. that workers' preferences are determined by their utility from being matched to each job, which might admit ties. Notably, in contrast to classical two-sided markets with strict preferences, there is no longer a single stable matching that simultaneously maximizes the utility for all workers.
  We aim to guarantee each worker the largest possible share from the utility in her best possible stable matching. We call the ratio between the worker's best possible stable utility and its assigned utility the \emph{Optimal Stable Share} (OSS)-ratio. We first prove that distributions over stable matchings cannot guarantee an OSS-ratio that is sublinear in the number of workers. Instead, randomizing over possibly non-stable matchings, we show how to achieve a tight logarithmic OSS-ratio. Then, we analyze the case where the real utility is not necessarily known and can only be approximated. In particular, we provide an algorithm that guarantees a similar fraction of the utility compared to the best possible utility. Finally, we move to a bandit setting, where we select a matching at each round and only observe the utilities for matches we perform. We show how to utilize our results for approximate utilities to gracefully interpolate between problems without ties and problems with statistical ties (small suboptimality gaps).</description>

      <title>Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings.

      <title>Provably Learning Diverse Features in Multi-View Data with Midpoint Mixup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixup is a data augmentation technique that relies on training using random convex combinations of data points and their labels. In recent years, Mixup has become a standard primitive used in the training of state-of-the-art image classification models due to its demonstrated benefits over empirical risk minimization with regards to generalization and robustness. In this work, we try to explain some of this success from a feature learning perspective. We focus our attention on classification problems in which each class may have multiple associated features (or views) that can be used to predict the class correctly. Our main theoretical results demonstrate that, for a non-trivial class of data distributions with two features per class, training a 2-layer convolutional network using empirical risk minimization can lead to learning only one feature for almost all classes while training with a specific instantiation of Mixup succeeds in learning both features for every class. We also show empirically that these theoretical insights extend to the practical settings of image benchmarks modified to have multiple features.</description>

      <title>On the Global Convergence of Risk-Averse Policy Gradient Methods with Expected Conditional Risk Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular tool for controlling the risk of uncertain outcomes and ensuring reliable performance in highly stochastic sequential decision-making problems. While Policy Gradient (PG) methods have been developed for risk-sensitive RL, it remains unclear if these methods enjoy the same global convergence guarantees as in the risk-neutral case \citep{mei2020global,agarwal2021theory,cen2022fast,bhandari2024global}. In this paper, we consider a class of dynamic time-consistent risk measures, named Expected Conditional Risk Measures (ECRMs), and derive PG and Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) updates for ECRMs-based RL problems. We provide global optimality {and iteration complexities} of the proposed algorithms under the following four settings: (i) PG with constrained direct parameterization, (ii) PG with softmax parameterization and log barrier regularization, (iii) NPG with softmax parameterization and entropy regularization, and (iv) approximate NPG with inexact policy evaluation. Furthermore, we test a risk-averse REINFORCE algorithm \citep{williams1992simple} and a risk-averse NPG algorithm \citep{kakade2001natural} on a stochastic Cliffwalk environment to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods and the importance of risk control.</description>

      <title>SageFormer: Series-Aware Framework for Long-term Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the burgeoning ecosystem of Internet of Things, multivariate time series (MTS) data has become ubiquitous, highlighting the fundamental role of time series forecasting across numerous applications. The crucial challenge of long-term MTS forecasting requires adept models capable of capturing both intra- and inter-series dependencies. Recent advancements in deep learning, notably Transformers, have shown promise. However, many prevailing methods either marginalize inter-series dependencies or overlook them entirely. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel series-aware framework, explicitly designed to emphasize the significance of such dependencies. At the heart of this framework lies our specific implementation: the SageFormer. As a Series-aware Graph-enhanced Transformer model, SageFormer proficiently discerns and models the intricate relationships between series using graph structures. Beyond capturing diverse temporal patterns, it also curtails redundant information across series. Notably, the series-aware framework seamlessly integrates with existing Transformer-based models, enriching their ability to comprehend inter-series relationships. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the superior performance of SageFormer against contemporary state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>First-Explore, then Exploit: Meta-Learning to Solve Hard Exploration-Exploitation Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents never intelligently explore like a human (i.e. taking into account complex domain priors and adapting quickly based on previous exploration). Across episodes, RL agents struggle to perform even simple exploration strategies, for example systematic search that avoids exploring the same location multiple times. This poor exploration limits performance on challenging domains. Meta-RL is a potential solution, as unlike standard RL, meta-RL can learn to explore, and potentially learn highly complex strategies far beyond those of standard RL, strategies such as experimenting in early episodes to learn new skills, or conducting experiments to learn about the current environment. Traditional meta-RL focuses on the problem of learning to optimally balance exploration and exploitation to maximize the cumulative reward of the episode sequence (e.g., aiming to maximize the total wins in a tournament -- while also improving as a player). We identify a new challenge with state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods. When optimal behavior requires exploration that sacrifices immediate reward to enable higher subsequent reward, existing state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods become stuck on the local optimum of failing to explore. Our method, First-Explore, overcomes this limitation by learning two policies: one to solely explore, and one to solely exploit. When exploring requires forgoing early-episode reward, First-Explore significantly outperforms existing cumulative meta-RL methods. By identifying and solving the previously unrecognized problem of forgoing reward in early episodes, First-Explore represents a significant step towards developing meta-RL algorithms capable of human-like exploration on a broader range of domains.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalarizations for Sublinear Hypervolume Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03288v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalarization is a general, parallizable technique that can be deployed in any multiobjective setting to reduce multiple objectives into one, yet some have dismissed this versatile approach because linear scalarizations cannot explore concave regions of the Pareto frontier. To that end, we aim to find simple non-linear scalarizations that provably explore a diverse set of $k$ objectives on the Pareto frontier, as measured by the dominated hypervolume. We show that hypervolume scalarizations with uniformly random weights achieves an optimal sublinear hypervolume regret bound of $O(T^{-1/k})$, with matching lower bounds that preclude any algorithm from doing better asymptotically. For the setting of multiobjective stochastic linear bandits, we utilize properties of hypervolume scalarizations to derive a novel non-Euclidean analysis to get regret bounds of $\tilde{O}( d T^{-1/2} + T^{-1/k})$, removing unnecessary $\text{poly}(k)$ dependencies. We support our theory with strong empirical performance of using non-linear scalarizations that outperforms both their linear counterparts and other standard multiobjective algorithms in a variety of natural settings.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting with Coherent Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining accurate probabilistic forecasts is an important operational challenge in many applications, like energy management, climate forecast, supply chain planning, and resource allocation. In many of these applications, there is a natural hierarchical structure over the forecasted quantities; and forecasting systems that adhere to this hierarchical structure are said to be coherent. Furthermore, operational planning benefits from accuracy at all levels of the aggregation hierarchy. Building accurate and coherent forecasting systems, however, is challenging: classic multivariate time series tools and neural network methods are still being adapted for this purpose. In this paper, we augment an MQForecaster neural network architecture with a novel deep Gaussian factor forecasting model that achieves coherence by construction, yielding a method we call the Deep Coherent Factor Model Neural Network (DeepCoFactor) model. DeepCoFactor generates samples that can be differentiated with respect to the model parameters, allowing optimization on various sample-based learning objectives that align with the forecasting system's goals, including quantile loss and the scaled Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). In a comparison to state-of-the-art coherent forecasting methods, DeepCoFactor achieves significant improvements in scaled CRPS forecast accuracy, with average gains of 15%, as measured on six publicly-available forecasting datasets.</description>

      <title>Temporal Smoothness Regularisers for Neural Link Predictors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al. proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models. Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers, highlighting a promising avenue for future research.</description>

      <title>Why Do We Need Weight Decay in Modern Deep Learning?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks from image classification to large language models. Despite its widespread usage and being extensively studied in the classical literature, its role remains poorly understood for deep learning. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For deep networks on vision tasks trained with multipass SGD, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for large language models trained with nearly one-epoch training, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss and improved training stability. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.

Abstract: Recent developments and research in modern machine learning have led to substantial improvements in the geospatial field. Although numerous deep learning architectures and models have been proposed, the majority of them have been solely developed on benchmark datasets that lack strong real-world relevance. Furthermore, the performance of many methods has already saturated on these datasets. We argue that a shift from a model-centric view to a complementary data-centric perspective is necessary for further improvements in accuracy, generalization ability, and real impact on end-user applications. Furthermore, considering the entire machine learning cycle-from problem definition to model deployment with feedback-is crucial for enhancing machine learning models that can be reliable in unforeseen situations. This work presents a definition as well as a precise categorization and overview of automated data-centric learning approaches for geospatial data. It highlights the complementary role of data-centric learning with respect to model-centric in the larger machine learning deployment cycle. We review papers across the entire geospatial field and categorize them into different groups. A set of representative experiments shows concrete implementation examples. These examples provide concrete steps to act on geospatial data with data-centric machine learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: This research proposes a model to predict the location of the most deprived areas in a city using data from the census. Census data is very high-dimensional and needs to be simplified. We use the diffusion map algorithm to reduce dimensionality and find patterns. Features are defined by eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix that defines the diffusion map. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues indicate specific characteristics of the population. Previous work has found qualitatively that the second most important dimension for describing the census data in Bristol, UK is linked to deprivation. In this research, we analyse how good this dimension is as a model for predicting deprivation by comparing it with the recognised measures. The Pearson correlation coefficient was found to be greater than 0.7. The top 10 per cent of deprived areas in the UK, which are also located in Bristol, are extracted to test the accuracy of the model. There are 52 of the most deprived areas, and 38 areas are correctly identified by comparing them to the model. The influence of scores of IMD domains that do not correlate with the models and Eigenvector 2 entries of non-deprived Output Areas cause the model to fail the prediction of 14 deprived areas. The model demonstrates strong performance in predicting future deprivation in the project areas, which is expected to assist in government resource allocation and funding greatly.

      <title>Identity Curvature Laplace Approximation for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is crucial in safety-critical applications, where robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential. Traditional Bayesian methods, though effective, are often hindered by high computational demands. As an alternative, Laplace approximation offers a more practical and efficient approach to uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce the Identity Curvature Laplace Approximation (ICLA), a novel method that challenges the conventional posterior covariance formulation by using identity curvature and optimizing prior precision. This innovative design significantly enhances OOD detection performance on well-known datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, while maintaining calibration scores. We attribute this improvement to the alignment issues between typical feature embeddings and curvature as measured by the Fisher information matrix. Our findings are further supported by demonstrating that incorporating Fisher penalty or sharpness-aware minimization techniques can greatly enhance the uncertainty estimation capabilities of standard Laplace approximation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Is All You Need: Autonomous Driving with JAX-Accelerated Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been demonstrated to outperform even the best humans in complex domains like video games. However, running reinforcement learning experiments on the required scale for autonomous driving is extremely difficult. Building a large scale reinforcement learning system and distributing it across many GPUs is challenging. Gathering experience during training on real world vehicles is prohibitive from a safety and scalability perspective. Therefore, an efficient and realistic driving simulator is required that uses a large amount of data from real-world driving. We bring these capabilities together and conduct large-scale reinforcement learning experiments for autonomous driving. We demonstrate that our policy performance improves with increasing scale. Our best performing policy reduces the failure rate by 64% while improving the rate of driving progress by 25% compared to the policies produced by state-of-the-art machine learning for autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16713v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI), a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends the current state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation methods by introducing key modifications specifically adapted to EHR data characteristics, namely: a) an attention-based hidden state initialisation technique to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) a domain-informed temporal decay mechanism to adjust the imputation process to clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural architectures in data restoration and downstream predictive tasks. Additionally, CSAI is integrated within PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</description>

      <title>Decision-focused predictions via pessimistic bilevel optimization: a computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dealing with uncertainty in optimization parameters is an important and longstanding challenge. Typically, uncertain parameters are predicted accurately, and then a deterministic optimization problem is solved. However, the decisions produced by this so-called \emph{predict-then-optimize} procedure can be highly sensitive to uncertain parameters. In this work, we contribute to recent efforts in producing \emph{decision-focused} predictions, i.e., to build predictive models that are constructed with the goal of minimizing a \emph{regret} measure on the decisions taken with them. We begin by formulating the exact expected regret minimization as a pessimistic bilevel optimization model. Then, we establish NP-completeness of this problem, even in a heavily restricted case. Using duality arguments, we reformulate it as a non-convex quadratic optimization problem. Finally, we show various computational techniques to achieve tractability. We report extensive computational results on shortest-path instances with uncertain cost vectors. Our results indicate that our approach can improve training performance over the approach of Elmachtoub and Grigas (2022), a state-of-the-art method for decision-focused learning.</description>

      <title>Federated Unlearning: A Survey on Methods, Design Guidelines, and Evaluation Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a machine learning (ML) model across multiple parties, facilitating the preservation of users' and institutions' privacy by maintaining data stored locally. Instead of centralizing raw data, FL exchanges locally refined model parameters to build a global model incrementally. While FL is more compliant with emerging regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring the right to be forgotten in this context - allowing FL participants to remove their data contributions from the learned model - remains unclear. In addition, it is recognized that malicious clients may inject backdoors into the global model through updates, e.g., to generate mispredictions on specially crafted data examples. Consequently, there is the need for mechanisms that can guarantee individuals the possibility to remove their data and erase malicious contributions even after aggregation, without compromising the already acquired "good" knowledge. This highlights the necessity for novel federated unlearning (FU) algorithms, which can efficiently remove specific clients' contributions without full model retraining. This article provides background concepts, empirical evidence, and practical guidelines to design/implement efficient FU schemes. This study includes a detailed analysis of the metrics for evaluating unlearning in FL and presents an in-depth literature review categorizing state-of-the-art FU contributions under a novel taxonomy. Finally, we outline the most relevant and still open technical challenges, by identifying the most promising research directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Equation Solving via Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning methods are gradually being adopted in a wide variety of social, economic, and scientific contexts, yet they are notorious for struggling with exact mathematics. A typical example is computer algebra, which includes tasks like simplifying mathematical terms, calculating formal derivatives, or finding exact solutions of algebraic equations. Traditional software packages for these purposes are commonly based on a huge database of rules for how a specific operation (e.g., differentiation) transforms a certain term (e.g., sine function) into another one (e.g., cosine function). These rules have usually needed to be discovered and subsequently programmed by humans. Efforts to automate this process by machine-learning approaches are faced with challenges like the singular nature of solutions to mathematical problems, when approximations are unacceptable, as well as hallucination effects leading to flawed reasoning. We propose a novel deep-learning interface involving a reinforcement-learning agent that operates a symbolic stack calculator to explore mathematical relations. By construction, this system is capable of exact transformations and immune to hallucination. Using the paradigmatic example of solving linear equations in symbolic form, we demonstrate how our reinforcement-learning agent autonomously discovers elementary transformation rules and step-by-step solutions.</description>

      <title>Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning to Compose Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05785v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks. In particular, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models. We open source our code at https://github.com/IBM/limitations-lm-algorithmic-compositional-learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Next-Level Post-Training Quantization of Hyper-Scale Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of generative AI models, post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for deploying hyper-scale models on edge devices such as mobile and TVs. Existing PTQ schemes, however, consume considerable time and resources, which could be a bottleneck in real situations where frequent model updates and multiple hyperparameter tunings are required. As a cost-effective alternative, learning-free PTQ schemes have been proposed. However, the performance is somewhat limited because they cannot consider the inter-layer dependency within the attention module, which is a significant feature of Transformers. In this paper, we thus propose a novel PTQ algorithm that balances accuracy and efficiency. The key idea of the proposed algorithm called aespa is to perform quantization layer-wise for efficiency while targeting attention-wise reconstruction to consider the cross-layer dependency. Through extensive experiments on various language models and complexity analysis, we demonstrate that aespa is accurate and efficient in quantizing Transformer models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness-aware classification models have gained increasing attention in recent years as concerns grow on discrimination against some demographic groups. Most existing models require full knowledge of the sensitive features, which can be impractical due to privacy, legal issues, and an individual's fear of discrimination. The key challenge we will address is the group dependency of the unavailability, e.g., people of some age range may be more reluctant to reveal their age. Our solution augments general fairness risks with probabilistic imputations of the sensitive features, while jointly learning the group-conditionally missing probabilities in a variational auto-encoder. Our model is demonstrated effective on both image and tabular datasets, achieving an improved balance between accuracy and fairness.</description>

      <title>Shaving Weights with Occam's Razor: Bayesian Sparsification for Neural Networks Using the Marginal Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network sparsification is a promising avenue to save computational time and memory costs, especially in an age where many successful AI models are becoming too large to na\"ively deploy on consumer hardware. While much work has focused on different weight pruning criteria, the overall sparsifiability of the network, i.e., its capacity to be pruned without quality loss, has often been overlooked. We present Sparsifiability via the Marginal likelihood (SpaM), a pruning framework that highlights the effectiveness of using the Bayesian marginal likelihood in conjunction with sparsity-inducing priors for making neural networks more sparsifiable. Our approach implements an automatic Occam's razor that selects the most sparsifiable model that still explains the data well, both for structured and unstructured sparsification. In addition, we demonstrate that the pre-computed posterior Hessian approximation used in the Laplace approximation can be re-used to define a cheap pruning criterion, which outperforms many existing (more expensive) approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially at high sparsity levels, across a range of different neural network architectures and datasets.</description>

      <title>When Your AIs Deceive You: Challenges of Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17747v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Past analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) assume that the human evaluators fully observe the environment. What happens when human feedback is based only on partial observations? We formally define two failure cases: deceptive inflation and overjustification. Modeling the human as Boltzmann-rational w.r.t. a belief over trajectories, we prove conditions under which RLHF is guaranteed to result in policies that deceptively inflate their performance, overjustify their behavior to make an impression, or both. Under the new assumption that the human's partial observability is known and accounted for, we then analyze how much information the feedback process provides about the return function. We show that sometimes, the human's feedback determines the return function uniquely up to an additive constant, but in other realistic cases, there is irreducible ambiguity. We propose exploratory research directions to help tackle these challenges, experimentally validate both the theoretical concerns and potential mitigations, and caution against blindly applying RLHF in partially observable settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) allows multiple agents to collaboratively build a decision making policy without sharing raw trajectories. However, if a small fraction of these agents are adversarial, it can lead to catastrophic results. We propose a policy gradient based approach that is robust to adversarial agents which can send arbitrary values to the server. Under this setting, our results form the first global convergence guarantees with general parametrization. These results demonstrate resilience with adversaries, while achieving optimal sample complexity of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{1}{N\epsilon^2} \left( 1+ \frac{f^2}{N}\right)\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of agents and $f&lt;N/2$ is the number of adversarial agents.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Pre-training with Language Models for Transferable Time Series Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</description>

Abstract: We explore the application of machine learning algorithms specifically to enhance the selection process of Russet potato clones in breeding trials by predicting their suitability for advancement. This study addresses the challenge of efficiently identifying high-yield, disease-resistant, and climate-resilient potato varieties that meet processing industry standards. Leveraging data from manually collected trials in the state of Oregon, we investigate the potential of a wide variety of state-of-the-art binary classification models. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset that includes preprocessing, feature engineering, and imputation to address missing values. We focus on several key metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for model evaluation. The top-performing models, namely a feedforward neural network classifier (Neural Net), histogram-based gradient boosting classifier (HGBC), and a support vector machine classifier (SVC), demonstrate consistent and significant results. To further validate our findings, we conducted a simulation study using the aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (ADEMP) framework, simulating different data-generating scenarios to assess model robustness and performance through true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative distributions area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and MCC. The simulation results highlight that non-linear models like SVC and HGBC consistently show higher ROC and MCC than logistic regression, thus outperforming the traditional linear model across various distributions, and emphasizing the importance of model selection and tuning in agricultural trials.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature Search Method for Multichannel EEG: Application in ADHD classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the preliminary diagnosis of ADHD using EEG has attracted the attention from researchers. EEG, known for its expediency and efficiency, plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, the non-stationarity of EEG signals and inter-subject variability pose challenges to the diagnostic and classification processes. Topological Data Analysis offers a novel perspective for ADHD classification, diverging from traditional time-frequency domain features. However, conventional TDA models are restricted to single-channel time series and are susceptible to noise, leading to the loss of topological features in persistence diagrams.This paper presents an enhanced TDA approach applicable to multi-channel EEG in ADHD. Initially, optimal input parameters for multi-channel EEG are determined. Subsequently, each channel's EEG undergoes phase space reconstruction (PSR) followed by the utilization of k-Power Distance to Measure for approximating ideal point clouds. Then, multi-dimensional time series are re-embedded, and TDA is applied to obtain topological feature information. Gaussian function-based Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation is employed in the merger persistence diagram to filter out desired topological feature mappings. Finally, the persistence image method is employed to extract topological features, and the influence of various weighting functions on the results is discussed.The effectiveness of our method is evaluated using the IEEE ADHD dataset. Results demonstrate that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach 78.27%, 80.62%, and 75.63%, respectively. Compared to traditional TDA methods, our method was effectively improved and outperforms typical nonlinear descriptors. These findings indicate that our method exhibits higher precision and robustness.</description>

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem offers a powerful framework for combining optimal transport and diffusion models. A promising recent approach to solve the SB problem is the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure, which alternates between Markovian and reciprocal projections of continuous-time stochastic processes. However, the model built by the IMF procedure has a long inference time due to using many steps of numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Discrete-time IMF (D-IMF) procedure in which learning of stochastic processes is replaced by learning just a few transition probabilities in discrete time. Its great advantage is that in practice it can be naturally implemented using the Denoising Diffusion GAN (DD-GAN), an already well-established adversarial generative modeling technique. We show that our D-IMF procedure can provide the same quality of unpaired domain translation as the IMF, using only several generation steps instead of hundreds. We provide the code at https://github.com/Daniil-Selikhanovych/ASBM.</description>

      <title>FUSE: Fast Unified Simulation and Estimation for PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Hitherto, it has been separately addressed by employing operator learning surrogates for field prediction while using simulation-based inference (and its variants) for statistical parameter determination. Here, we argue that solving both problems within the same framework can lead to consistent gains in accuracy and robustness. To this end, We propose a novel and flexible formulation of the operator learning problem that allows jointly predicting continuous quantities and inferring distributions of discrete parameters, and thus amortizing the cost of both the inverse and the surrogate models to a joint pre-training step. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.</description>

      <title>Recursive PAC-Bayes: A Frequentist Approach to Sequential Prior Updates with No Information Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PAC-Bayesian analysis is a frequentist framework for incorporating prior knowledge into learning. It was inspired by Bayesian learning, which allows sequential data processing and naturally turns posteriors from one processing step into priors for the next. However, despite two and a half decades of research, the ability to update priors sequentially without losing confidence information along the way remained elusive for PAC-Bayes. While PAC-Bayes allows construction of data-informed priors, the final confidence intervals depend only on the number of points that were not used for the construction of the prior, whereas confidence information in the prior, which is related to the number of points used to construct the prior, is lost. This limits the possibility and benefit of sequential prior updates, because the final bounds depend only on the size of the final batch.
  We present a novel and, in retrospect, surprisingly simple and powerful PAC-Bayesian procedure that allows sequential prior updates with no information loss. The procedure is based on a novel decomposition of the expected loss of randomized classifiers. The decomposition rewrites the loss of the posterior as an excess loss relative to a downscaled loss of the prior plus the downscaled loss of the prior, which is bounded recursively. As a side result, we also present a generalization of the split-kl and PAC-Bayes-split-kl inequalities to discrete random variables, which we use for bounding the excess losses, and which can be of independent interest. In empirical evaluation the new procedure significantly outperforms state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>AGILE: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Framework of LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework of LLM agents named AGILE (AGent that Interacts and Learns from Environments) designed to perform complex conversational tasks with users, leveraging LLMs, memory, tools, and interactions with experts. The agent possesses capabilities beyond conversation, including reflection, tool usage, and expert consultation. We formulate the construction of such an LLM agent as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the LLM serves as the policy model. We fine-tune the LLM using labeled data of actions and the PPO algorithm. We focus on question answering and release a dataset for agents called ProductQA, comprising challenging questions in online shopping. Our extensive experiments on ProductQA, MedMCQA and HotPotQA show that AGILE agents based on 7B and 13B LLMs trained with PPO can outperform GPT-4 agents. Our ablation study highlights the indispensability of memory, tools, consultation, reflection, and reinforcement learning in achieving the agent's strong performance. Datasets and code are available at https://github.com/bytarnish/AGILE.</description>

      <title>MicroAdam: Accurate Adaptive Optimization with Low Space Overhead and Provable Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new variant of the Adam optimizer called MicroAdam that specifically minimizes memory overheads, while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. We achieve this by compressing the gradient information before it is fed into the optimizer state, thereby reducing its memory footprint significantly. We control the resulting compression error via a novel instance of the classical \emph{error feedback} mechanism from distributed optimization in which *the error correction information is itself compressed* to allow for practical memory gains. We prove that the resulting approach maintains theoretical convergence guarantees competitive to those of AMSGrad, while providing good practical performance. Specifically, we show that MicroAdam can be implemented efficiently on GPUs: on both million-scale (BERT) and billion-scale (LLaMA) models, MicroAdam provides practical convergence competitive to that of the uncompressed Adam baseline, with lower memory usage and similar running time. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/MicroAdam.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge Implicit Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we take the first step in fast sampling of DDBMs without extra training, motivated by the well-established recipes in diffusion models. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same marginal distributions and training objectives, give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic, and result in diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs). DBIMs are not only up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs but also induce a novel, simple, and insightful form of ordinary differential equation (ODE) which inspires high-order numerical solvers. Moreover, DBIMs maintain the generation diversity in a distinguished way, by using a booting noise in the initial sampling step, which enables faithful encoding, reconstruction, and semantic interpolation in image translation tasks.

      <title>Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in learning governing differential equations from observations of dynamical systems, data-driven methods are often unaware of fundamental physical laws, such as frame invariance. As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover less accurate or overly complex equations. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across diverse dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/symmetry-ode-discovery.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Multinomial Logit Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new class of MDPs that employs multinomial logit (MNL) function approximation to ensure valid probability distributions over the state space. Despite its benefits, introducing the non-linear function raises significant challenges in both computational and statistical efficiency. The best-known result of Hwang and Oh [2023] has achieved an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{-1}dH^2\sqrt{K})$ regret, where $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent quantity, $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ is the episode length, and $K$ is the number of episodes. While this result attains the same rate in $K$ as linear cases, the method requires storing all historical data and suffers from an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ computation cost per episode. Moreover, the quantity $\kappa$ can be exponentially small in the worst case, leading to a significant gap for the regret compared to linear function approximation. In this work, we first address the computational and storage issue by proposing an algorithm that achieves the same regret with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost. Then, we design an enhanced algorithm that leverages local information to enhance statistical efficiency. It not only maintains an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation and storage cost per episode but also achieves an improved regret of $\widetilde{O}(dH^2\sqrt{K} + d^2H^2\kappa^{-1})$, nearly closing the gap with linear function approximation. Finally, we establish the first lower bound for MNL function approximation, justifying the optimality of our results in $d$ and $K$.</description>

      <title>Online Analytic Exemplar-Free Continual Learning with Large Models for Imbalanced Autonomous Driving Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, even a meticulously trained model can encounter failures when facing unfamiliar scenarios. One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning algorithm (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the mean and the variance of real features for each class. It over-samples offset pseudo-features from the same normal distribution as the real features, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue. Experimental results demonstrate that despite being an exemplar-free strategy, our method outperforms various methods on the autonomous driving SODA10M dataset.

      <description>arXiv:2405.19101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</description>

      <title>Self-Exploring Language Models: Active Preference Elicitation for Online Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preference optimization, particularly through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), has achieved significant success in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to adhere to human intentions. Unlike offline alignment with a fixed dataset, online feedback collection from humans or AI on model generations typically leads to more capable reward models and better-aligned LLMs through an iterative process. However, achieving a globally accurate reward model requires systematic exploration to generate diverse responses that span the vast space of natural language. Random sampling from standard reward-maximizing LLMs alone is insufficient to fulfill this requirement. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel objective optimistically biased towards potentially high-reward responses to actively explore out-of-distribution regions. By solving the inner-level problem with the reparameterized reward function, the resulting algorithm, named Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM), eliminates the need for a separate RM and iteratively updates the LLM with a straightforward objective. Compared to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the SELM objective reduces indiscriminate favor of unseen extrapolations and enhances exploration efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that when fine-tuned on Zephyr-7B-SFT and Llama-3-8B-Instruct models, SELM significantly boosts the performance on instruction-following benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0, as well as various standard academic benchmarks in different settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/SELM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) notoriously struggle to learn long-term memories, primarily due to vanishing and exploding gradients. The recent success of state-space models (SSMs), a subclass of RNNs, to overcome such difficulties challenges our theoretical understanding. In this paper, we delve into the optimization challenges of RNNs and discover that, as the memory of a network increases, changes in its parameters result in increasingly large output variations, making gradient-based learning highly sensitive, even without exploding gradients. Our analysis further reveals the importance of the element-wise recurrence design pattern combined with careful parametrizations in mitigating this effect. This feature is present in SSMs, as well as in other architectures, such as LSTMs. Overall, our insights provide a new explanation for some of the difficulties in gradient-based learning of RNNs and why some architectures perform better than others.</description>

      <title>How Does Gradient Descent Learn Features -- A Local Analysis for Regularized Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of learning useful features is one of the major advantages of neural networks. Although recent works show that neural network can operate in a neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that does not allow feature learning, many works also demonstrate the potential for neural networks to go beyond NTK regime and perform feature learning. Recently, a line of work highlighted the feature learning capabilities of the early stages of gradient-based training. In this paper we consider another mechanism for feature learning via gradient descent through a local convergence analysis. We show that once the loss is below a certain threshold, gradient descent with a carefully regularized objective will capture ground-truth directions. We further strengthen this local convergence analysis by incorporating early-stage feature learning analysis. Our results demonstrate that feature learning not only happens at the initial gradient steps, but can also occur towards the end of training.</description>

      <title>DFA-GNN: Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks by Direct Feedback Alignment</title>

Abstract: Graph neural networks are recognized for their strong performance across various applications, with the backpropagation algorithm playing a central role in the development of most GNN models. However, despite its effectiveness, BP has limitations that challenge its biological plausibility and affect the efficiency, scalability and parallelism of training neural networks for graph-based tasks. While several non-BP training algorithms, such as the direct feedback alignment, have been successfully applied to fully-connected and convolutional network components for handling Euclidean data, directly adapting these non-BP frameworks to manage non-Euclidean graph data in GNN models presents significant challenges. These challenges primarily arise from the violation of the i.i.d. assumption in graph data and the difficulty in accessing prediction errors for all samples (nodes) within the graph. To overcome these obstacles, in this paper we propose DFA-GNN, a novel forward learning framework tailored for GNNs with a case study of semi-supervised learning. The proposed method breaks the limitations of BP by using a dedicated forward training mechanism. Specifically, DFA-GNN extends the principles of DFA to adapt to graph data and unique architecture of GNNs, which incorporates the information of graph topology into the feedback links to accommodate the non-Euclidean characteristics of graph data. Additionally, for semi-supervised graph learning tasks, we developed a pseudo error generator that spreads residual errors from training data to create a pseudo error for each unlabeled node. These pseudo errors are then utilized to train GNNs using DFA. Extensive experiments on 10 public benchmarks reveal that our learning framework outperforms not only previous non-BP methods but also the standard BP methods, and it exhibits excellent robustness against various types of noise and attacks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overoptimization in Direct Alignment Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been crucial to the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), however, it is often a complex and brittle process. In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimize the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is reward over-optimization or reward hacking, where performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but true quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs) like Direct Preference Optimization have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline by circumventing the reward modeling phase. However, although DAAs do not use a separate proxy reward model, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patterns to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL budgets but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation, this work formulates and formalizes the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales.</description>

      <title>Excluding the Irrelevant: Focusing Reinforcement Learning through Continuous Action Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) are commonly defined as multidimensional intervals. While intervals usually reflect the action boundaries for tasks well, they can be challenging for learning because the typically large global action space leads to frequent exploration of irrelevant actions. Yet, little task knowledge can be sufficient to identify significantly smaller state-specific sets of relevant actions. Focusing learning on these relevant actions can significantly improve training efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to focus learning on the set of relevant actions and introduce three continuous action masking methods for exactly mapping the action space to the state-dependent set of relevant actions. Thus, our methods ensure that only relevant actions are executed, enhancing the predictability of the RL agent and enabling its use in safety-critical applications. We further derive the implications of the proposed methods on the policy gradient. Using proximal policy optimization (PPO), we evaluate our methods on four control tasks, where the relevant action set is computed based on the system dynamics and a relevant state set. Our experiments show that the three action masking methods achieve higher final rewards and converge faster than the baseline without action masking.</description>

      <title>Skill-aware Mutual Information Optimisation for Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) agents can struggle to operate across tasks with varying environmental features that require different optimal skills (i.e., different modes of behaviour). Using context encoders based on contrastive learning to enhance the generalisability of Meta-RL agents is now widely studied but faces challenges such as the requirement for a large sample size, also referred to as the $\log$-$K$ curse. To improve RL generalisation to different tasks, we first introduce Skill-aware Mutual Information (SaMI), an optimisation objective that aids in distinguishing context embeddings according to skills, thereby equipping RL agents with the ability to identify and execute different skills across tasks. We then propose Skill-aware Noise Contrastive Estimation (SaNCE), a $K$-sample estimator used to optimise the SaMI objective. We provide a framework for equipping an RL agent with SaNCE in practice and conduct experimental validation on modified MuJoCo and Panda-gym benchmarks. We empirically find that RL agents that learn by maximising SaMI achieve substantially improved zero-shot generalisation to unseen tasks. Additionally, the context encoder trained with SaNCE demonstrates greater robustness to a reduction in the number of available samples, thus possessing the potential to overcome the $\log$-$K$ curse.</description>

      <title>Parallelizing Linear Transformers with the Delta Rule over Sequence Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers with linear attention (i.e., linear transformers) and state-space models have recently been suggested as a viable linear-time alternative to transformers with softmax attention. However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive update in linear transformers with the delta rule (DeltaNet) have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks. We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrids outperform strong transformer baselines.</description>

      <title>When is Multicalibration Post-Processing Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration is a well-studied property of predictors which guarantees meaningful uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a related notion -- originating in algorithmic fairness -- which requires predictors to be simultaneously calibrated over a potentially complex and overlapping collection of protected subpopulations (such as groups defined by ethnicity, race, or income). We conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the usefulness of multicalibration post-processing across a broad set of tabular, image, and language datasets for models spanning from simple decision trees to 90 million parameter fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) models which are calibrated out of the box tend to be relatively multicalibrated without any additional post-processing; (2) multicalibration post-processing can help inherently uncalibrated models and large vision and language models; and (3) traditional calibration measures may sometimes provide multicalibration implicitly. More generally, we also distill many independent observations which may be useful for practical and effective applications of multicalibration post-processing in real-world contexts. We also release a python package implementing multicalibration algorithms, available via `pip install multicalibration'.</description>

      <title>Aligning Model Properties via Conformal Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI model alignment is crucial due to inadvertent biases in training data and the underspecified machine learning pipeline, where models with excellent test metrics may not meet end-user requirements. While post-training alignment via human feedback shows promise, these methods are often limited to generative AI settings where humans can interpret and provide feedback on model outputs. In traditional non-generative settings with numerical or categorical outputs, detecting misalignment through single-sample outputs remains challenging, and enforcing alignment during training requires repeating costly training processes. In this paper we consider an alternative strategy. We propose interpreting model alignment through property testing, defining an aligned model $f$ as one belonging to a subset $\mathcal{P}$ of functions that exhibit specific desired behaviors. We focus on post-processing a pre-trained model $f$ to better align with $\mathcal{P}$ using conformal risk control. Specifically, we develop a general procedure for converting queries for testing a given property $\mathcal{P}$ to a collection of loss functions suitable for use in a conformal risk control algorithm. We prove a probabilistic guarantee that the resulting conformal interval around $f$ contains a function approximately satisfying $\mathcal{P}$. We exhibit applications of our methodology on a collection of supervised learning datasets for (shape-constrained) properties such as monotonicity and concavity. The general procedure is flexible and can be applied to a wide range of desired properties. Finally, we prove that pre-trained models will always require alignment techniques even as model sizes or training data increase, as long as the training data contains even small biases.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially-private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is a family of iterative machine learning training algorithms that privatize gradients to generate a sequence of differentially-private (DP) model parameters. It is also the standard tool used to train DP models in practice, even though most users are only interested in protecting the privacy of the final model. Tight DP accounting for the last iterate would minimize the amount of noise required while maintaining the same privacy guarantee and potentially increasing model utility. However, last-iterate accounting is challenging, and existing works require strong assumptions not satisfied by most implementations. These include assuming (i) the global sensitivity constant is known - to avoid gradient clipping; (ii) the loss function is Lipschitz or convex; and (iii) input batches are sampled randomly.
  In this work, we forego any unrealistic assumptions and provide privacy bounds for the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which data is traversed cyclically, gradients are clipped, and only the last model is released. More specifically, we establish new Renyi differential privacy (RDP) upper bounds for the last iterate under realistic assumptions of small stepsize and Lipschitz smoothness of the loss function. Our general bounds also recover the special-case convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero and no clipping is performed. The approach itself leverages optimal transport techniques for last iterate bounds, which is a nontrivial task when the data is traversed cyclically and the loss function is nonconvex.</description>

      <title>Not All Frequencies Are Created Equal:Towards a Dynamic Fusion of Frequencies in Time-Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability.
  Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF. The code is available at https://github.com/Zh-XY22/FreDF.</description>

Abstract: Despite Flow Matching and diffusion models having emerged as powerful generative paradigms for continuous variables such as images and videos, their application to high-dimensional discrete data, such as language, is still limited. In this work, we present Discrete Flow Matching, a novel discrete flow paradigm designed specifically for generating discrete data. Discrete Flow Matching offers several key contributions:(i) it works with a general family of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions; (ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths using learned posteriors such as the probability denoiser ($x$-prediction) and noise-prediction ($\epsilon$-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on specific probability paths defined with different schedulers improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow models; and (iv) by scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B parameters, we reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1 and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks. Our approach is capable of generating high-quality discrete data in a non-autoregressive fashion, significantly closing the gap between autoregressive models and discrete flow models.</description>

Abstract: Deep Geothermal Energy, Carbon Capture and Storage, and Hydrogen Storage hold considerable promise for meeting the energy sector's large-scale requirements and reducing CO$_2$ emissions. However, the injection of fluids into the Earth's crust, essential for these activities, can induce or trigger earthquakes. In this paper, we highlight a new approach based on Reinforcement Learning for the control of human-induced seismicity in the highly complex environment of an underground reservoir. This complex system poses significant challenges in the control design due to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. We show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can interact efficiently with a robust controller, by choosing the controller parameters in real-time, reducing human-induced seismicity and allowing the consideration of further production objectives, \textit{e.g.}, minimal control power. Simulations are presented for a simplified underground reservoir under various energy demand scenarios, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed control-reinforcement learning approach.</description>

      <title>Diversity-Driven Synthesis: Enhancing Dataset Distillation through Directed Weight Adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic datasets that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.

      <description>arXiv:2409.19839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasts of future events are essential inputs into informed decision-making. Machine learning (ML) systems have the potential to deliver forecasts at scale, but there is no framework for evaluating the accuracy of ML systems on a standardized set of forecasting questions. To address this gap, we introduce ForecastBench: a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the accuracy of ML systems on an automatically generated and regularly updated set of 1,000 forecasting questions. To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM (p-value $=0.01$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org.</description>

Abstract: Heart failure remains a major global health challenge, contributing significantly to the 17.8 million annual deaths from cardiovascular disease, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic tools. Current heart disease prediction models based on classical machine learning face limitations, including poor handling of high-dimensional, imbalanced data, limited performance on small datasets, and a lack of uncertainty quantification, while also being difficult for healthcare professionals to interpret. To address these issues, we introduce KACQ-DCNN, a novel classical-quantum hybrid dual-channel neural network that replaces traditional multilayer perceptrons and convolutional layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). This approach enhances function approximation with learnable univariate activation functions, reducing model complexity and improving generalization. The KACQ-DCNN 4-qubit 1-layered model significantly outperforms 37 benchmark models across multiple metrics, achieving an accuracy of 92.03%, a macro-average precision, recall, and F1 score of 92.00%, and an ROC-AUC score of 94.77%. Ablation studies demonstrate the synergistic benefits of combining classical and quantum components with KAN. Additionally, explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP provide feature-level insights, improving model transparency, while uncertainty quantification via conformal prediction ensures robust probability estimates. These results suggest that KACQ-DCNN offers a promising path toward more accurate, interpretable, and reliable heart disease predictions, paving the way for advancements in cardiovascular healthcare.</description>

      <title>ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) arise in various domains, such as energy systems and transportation, but are notoriously difficult to solve. Recent advances in machine learning have led to remarkable successes in optimization tasks, an area broadly known as learning to optimize. This approach includes using predictive models to generate solutions for optimization problems with continuous decision variables, thereby avoiding the need for computationally expensive optimization algorithms. However, applying learning to MINLPs remains challenging primarily due to the presence of integer decision variables, which complicate gradient-based learning. To address this limitation, we propose two differentiable correction layers that generate integer outputs while preserving gradient information. Combined with a soft penalty for constraint violation, our framework can tackle both the integrality and non-linear constraints in a MINLP. Experiments on three problem classes with convex/non-convex objective/constraints and integer/mixed-integer variables show that the proposed learning-based approach consistently produces high-quality solutions for parametric MINLPs extremely quickly. As problem size increases, traditional exact solvers and heuristic methods struggle to find feasible solutions, whereas our approach continues to deliver reliable results. Our work extends the scope of learning-to-optimize to MINLP, paving the way for integrating integer constraints into deep learning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/pnnl/L2O-pMINLP.</description>

      <title>Survival Multiarmed Bandits with Bootstrapping Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Multiarmed Bandits (MAB) problem has been extensively studied and has seen many practical applications in a variety of fields. The Survival Multiarmed Bandits (S-MAB) open problem is an extension which constrains an agent to a budget that is directly related to observed rewards. As budget depletion leads to ruin, an agent's objective is to both maximize expected cumulative rewards and minimize the probability of ruin. This paper presents a framework that addresses such a dual goal using an objective function balanced by a ruin aversion component. Action values are estimated through a novel approach which consists of bootstrapping samples from previously observed rewards. In numerical experiments, the policies we present outperform benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concept-based machine learning methods have increasingly gained importance due to the growing interest in making neural networks interpretable. However, concept annotations are generally challenging to obtain, making it crucial to leverage all their prior knowledge. By creating concept-enriched models that incorporate concept information into existing architectures, we exploit their interpretable capabilities to the fullest extent. In particular, we propose Concept-Guided Conditional Diffusion, which can generate visual representations of concepts, and Concept-Guided Prototype Networks, which can create a concept prototype dataset and leverage it to perform interpretable concept prediction. These results open up new lines of research by exploiting pre-existing information in the quest for rendering machine learning more human-understandable.</description>

      <title>Whither Bias Goes, I Will Go: An Integrative, Systematic Review of Algorithmic Bias Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used for personnel assessment and selection (e.g., resume screeners, automatically scored interviews). However, concerns have been raised throughout society that ML assessments may be biased and perpetuate or exacerbate inequality. Although organizational researchers have begun investigating ML assessments from traditional psychometric and legal perspectives, there is a need to understand, clarify, and integrate fairness operationalizations and algorithmic bias mitigation methods from the computer science, data science, and organizational research literatures. We present a four-stage model of developing ML assessments and applying bias mitigation methods, including 1) generating the training data, 2) training the model, 3) testing the model, and 4) deploying the model. When introducing the four-stage model, we describe potential sources of bias and unfairness at each stage. Then, we systematically review definitions and operationalizations of algorithmic bias, legal requirements governing personnel selection from the United States and Europe, and research on algorithmic bias mitigation across multiple domains and integrate these findings into our framework. Our review provides insights for both research and practice by elucidating possible mechanisms of algorithmic bias while identifying which bias mitigation methods are legal and effective. This integrative framework also reveals gaps in the knowledge of algorithmic bias mitigation that should be addressed by future collaborative research between organizational researchers, computer scientists, and data scientists. We provide recommendations for developing and deploying ML assessments, as well as recommendations for future research into algorithmic bias and fairness.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become a widely used strategy for working with large language and multimodal models. While CoT has been shown to improve performance across many tasks, determining the settings in which it is effective remains an ongoing effort. In particular, it is still an open question in what settings CoT systematically reduces model performance. In this paper, we seek to identify the characteristics of tasks where CoT reduces performance by drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, looking at cases where (i) verbal thinking or deliberation hurts performance in humans, and (ii) the constraints governing human performance generalize to language models. Three such cases are implicit statistical learning, visual recognition, and classifying with patterns containing exceptions. In extensive experiments across all three settings, we find that a diverse collection of state-of-the-art models exhibit significant drop-offs in performance (e.g., up to 36.3% absolute accuracy for OpenAI o1-preview compared to GPT-4o) when using inference-time reasoning compared to zero-shot counterparts. We also identify three tasks that satisfy condition (i) but not (ii), and find that while verbal thinking reduces human performance in these tasks, CoT retains or increases model performance. Overall, our results show that while there is not an exact parallel between the cognitive processes of models and those of humans, considering cases where thinking has negative consequences for human performance can help us identify settings where it negatively impacts models. By connecting the literature on human deliberation with evaluations of CoT, we offer a new tool that can be used in understanding the impact of prompt choices and inference-time reasoning.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Exploration via Stationary Bellman Error Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration is a crucial and distinctive aspect of reinforcement learning (RL) that remains a fundamental open problem. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge. Commonly used methods inject random noise directly into the actions, indirectly via entropy maximization, or add intrinsic rewards that encourage the agent to steer to novel regions of the state space. Another previously seen idea is to use the Bellman error as a separate optimization objective for exploration. In this paper, we introduce three modifications to stabilize the latter and arrive at a deterministic exploration policy. Our separate exploration agent is informed about the state of the exploitation, thus enabling it to account for previous experiences. Further components are introduced to make the exploration objective agnostic toward the episode length and to mitigate instability introduced by far-off-policy learning. Our experimental results show that our approach can outperform $\varepsilon$-greedy in dense and sparse reward settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar variables, e.g., the orientation of a shape in an image, are commonly predicted using a single output neuron in a neural network. In contrast, the mammalian cortex represents variables with a population of neurons. In this population code, each neuron is most active at its preferred value and shows partial activity for other values. Here, we investigate the benefit of using a population code for the output layer of a neural network. We compare population codes against single-neuron outputs and one-hot vectors. First, we show theoretically and in experiments with synthetic data that population codes improve robustness to input noise in networks of stacked linear layers. Second, we demonstrate the benefit of using population codes to encode ambiguous outputs, such as the pose of symmetric objects. Using the T-LESS dataset of feature-less real-world objects, we show that population codes improve the accuracy of predicting 3D object orientation from image input.</description>

      <title>FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Theory-inspired Label Shift Adaptation via Aligned Distribution Mixture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a prominent challenge in addressing real-world issues within a dynamic environment, label shift, which refers to the learning setting where the source (training) and target (testing) label distributions do not match, has recently received increasing attention. Existing label shift methods solely use unlabeled target samples to estimate the target label distribution, and do not involve them during the classifier training, resulting in suboptimal utilization of available information. One common solution is to directly blend the source and target distributions during the training of the target classifier. However, we illustrate the theoretical deviation and limitations of the direct distribution mixture in the label shift setting. To tackle this crucial yet unexplored issue, we introduce the concept of aligned distribution mixture, showcasing its theoretical optimality and generalization error bounds. By incorporating insights from generalization theory, we propose an innovative label shift framework named as Aligned Distribution Mixture (ADM). Within this framework, we enhance four typical label shift methods by introducing modifications to the classifier training process. Furthermore, we also propose a one-step approach that incorporates a pioneering coupling weight estimation strategy. Considering the distinctiveness of the proposed one-step approach, we develop an efficient bi-level optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, together with their effectiveness in COVID-19 diagnosis applications.</description>

      <title>Losing momentum in continuous-time stochastic optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of modern machine learning models often consists in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimisation problems that are subject to large-scale data. In this context, momentum-based stochastic optimisation algorithms have become particularly widespread. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces computational cost. Both, momentum and stochasticity help the algorithm to converge globally. In this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov process that represents the optimiser by an underdamped dynamical system and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching. We investigate longtime limits, the subsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We are particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system to the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and letting the subsampling rate go to infinity. We then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an algorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In experiments, we study our scheme in convex and non-convex test problems. Additionally, we train a convolutional neural network in an image classification problem. Our algorithm {attains} competitive results compared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The partial observability and stochasticity in multi-agent settings can be mitigated by accessing more information about others via communication. However, the coordination problem still exists since agents cannot communicate actual actions with each other at the same time due to the circular dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level communication scheme, Sequential Communication (SeqComm). SeqComm treats agents asynchronously (the upper-level agents make decisions before the lower-level ones) and has two communication phases. In the negotiation phase, agents determine the priority of decision-making by communicating hidden states of observations and comparing the value of intention, obtained by modeling the environment dynamics. In the launching phase, the upper-level agents take the lead in making decisions and then communicate their actions with the lower-level agents. Theoretically, we prove the policies learned by SeqComm are guaranteed to improve monotonically and converge. Empirically, we show that SeqComm outperforms existing methods in various cooperative multi-agent tasks.</description>

Abstract: Deep ensembles are capable of achieving state-of-the-art results in classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, their effectiveness is limited due to the homogeneity of learned patterns within ensembles. To overcome this issue, our study introduces Saliency Diversified Deep Ensemble (SDDE), a novel approach that promotes diversity among ensemble members by leveraging saliency maps. Through incorporating saliency map diversification, our method outperforms conventional ensemble techniques and improves calibration in multiple classification and OOD detection tasks. In particular, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection quality, calibration, and accuracy on multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR10/100 and large-scale ImageNet datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent emergence of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a fundamental paradigm for learning image representations has, and continues to, demonstrate high empirical success in a variety of tasks. However, most SSL approaches fail to learn embeddings that capture hierarchical semantic concepts that are separable and interpretable. In this work, we aim to learn highly separable semantic hierarchical representations by stacking Joint Embedding Architectures (JEA) where higher-level JEAs are input with representations of lower-level JEA. This results in a representation space that exhibits distinct sub-categories of semantic concepts (e.g., model and colour of vehicles) in higher-level JEAs. We empirically show that representations from stacked JEA perform on a similar level as traditional JEA with comparative parameter counts and visualise the representation spaces to validate the semantic hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Fast Empirical Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We seek to extract a small number of representative scenarios from large panel data that are consistent with sample moments. Among two novel algorithms, the first identifies scenarios that have not been observed before, and comes with a scenario-based representation of covariance matrices. The second proposal selects important data points from states of the world that have already realized, and are consistent with higher-order sample moment information. Both algorithms are efficient to compute and lend themselves to consistent scenario-based modeling and multi-dimensional numerical integration that can be used for interpretable decision-making under uncertainty. Extensive numerical benchmarking studies and an application in portfolio optimization favor the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Equivariance and partial observations in Koopman operator theory for partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator has become an essential tool for data-driven analysis, prediction and control of complex systems. The main reason is the enormous potential of identifying linear function space representations of nonlinear dynamics from measurements. This equally applies to ordinary, stochastic, and partial differential equations (PDEs). Until now, with a few exceptions only, the PDE case is mostly treated rather superficially, and the specific structure of the underlying dynamics is largely ignored. In this paper, we show that symmetries in the system dynamics can be carried over to the Koopman operator, which allows us to significantly increase the model efficacy. Moreover, the situation where we only have access to partial observations (i.e., measurements, as is very common for experimental data) has not been treated to its full extent, either. Moreover, we address the highly-relevant case where we cannot measure the full state, where alternative approaches (e.g., delay coordinates) have to be considered. We derive rigorous statements on the required number of observables in this situation, based on embedding theory. We present numerical evidence using various numerical examples including the wave equation and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Veracity Classification with LLM-Predicted Credibility Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Credibility signals represent a wide range of heuristics typically used by journalists and fact-checkers to assess the veracity of online content. Automating the extraction of credibility signals presents significant challenges due to the necessity of training high-accuracy, signal-specific extractors, coupled with the lack of sufficiently large annotated datasets. This paper introduces Pastel (Prompted weAk Supervision wiTh crEdibility signaLs), a weakly supervised approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract credibility signals from web content, and subsequently combines them to predict the veracity of content without relying on human supervision. We validate our approach using four article-level misinformation detection datasets, demonstrating that Pastel outperforms zero-shot veracity detection by 38.3% and achieves 86.7% of the performance of the state-of-the-art system trained with human supervision. Moreover, in cross-domain settings where training and testing datasets originate from different domains, Pastel significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised model by 63%. We further study the association between credibility signals and veracity, and perform an ablation study showing the impact of each signal on model performance. Our findings reveal that 12 out of the 19 proposed signals exhibit strong associations with veracity across all datasets, while some signals show domain-specific strengths.</description>

      <title>Contextual Knowledge Pursuit for Faithful Visual Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern text-to-vision generative models often hallucinate when the prompt describing the scene to be generated is underspecified. In large language models (LLMs), a prevalent strategy to reduce hallucinations is to retrieve factual knowledge from an external database. While such retrieval augmentation strategies have great potential to enhance text-to-vision generators, existing static top-K retrieval methods explore the knowledge pool once, missing the broader context necessary for high-quality generation. Furthermore, LLMs internally possess rich world knowledge learned during large-scale training (parametric knowledge) that could mitigate the need for external data retrieval. This paper proposes Contextual Knowledge Pursuit (CKPT), a framework that leverages the complementary strengths of external and parametric knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of the one-time retrieval of facts from an external database to improve a given prompt, CKPT uses (1) an LLM to decide whether to seek external knowledge or to self-elicit descriptions from LLM parametric knowledge, (2) a knowledge pursuit process to contextually seek and sequentially gather most relevant facts, (3) a knowledge aggregator for prompt enhancement with the gathered fact context, and (4) a filtered fine-tuning objective to improve visual synthesis with richer prompts. We evaluate CKPT across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video) on datasets of rare objects and daily scenarios. Our results show that CKPT is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising data source for zero-shot synthesis and filtered fine-tuning of text-to-vision generative models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Active Feature Acquisition Methods for Time-varying Feature Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods often assume that input features are available at no cost. However, in domains like healthcare, where acquiring features could be expensive or harmful, it is necessary to balance a feature's acquisition cost against its predictive value. The task of training an AI agent to decide which features to acquire is called active feature acquisition (AFA). By deploying an AFA agent, we effectively alter the acquisition strategy and trigger a distribution shift. To safely deploy AFA agents under this distribution shift, we present the problem of active feature acquisition performance evaluation (AFAPE). We examine AFAPE under i) a no direct effect (NDE) assumption, stating that acquisitions do not affect the underlying feature values; and ii) a no unobserved confounding (NUC) assumption, stating that retrospective feature acquisition decisions were only based on observed features. We show that one can apply missing data methods under the NDE assumption and offline reinforcement learning under the NUC assumption. When NUC and NDE hold, we propose a novel semi-offline reinforcement learning framework. This framework requires a weaker positivity assumption and introduces three new estimators: A direct method (DM), an inverse probability weighting (IPW), and a double reinforcement learning (DRL) estimator.</description>

      <title>A Natural Language Processing-Based Classification and Mode-Based Ranking of Musculoskeletal Disorder Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research delves into Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) risk factors, using a blend of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and mode-based ranking. The aim is to refine understanding, classification, and prioritization for focused prevention and treatment. Eight NLP models are evaluated, combining pre-trained transformers, cosine similarity, and distance metrics to categorize factors into personal, biomechanical, workplace, psychological, and organizational classes. BERT with cosine similarity achieves 28% accuracy; sentence transformer with Euclidean, Bray-Curtis, and Minkowski distances scores 100%. With 10-fold cross-validation, statistical tests ensure robust results. Survey data and mode-based ranking determine severity hierarchy, aligning with the literature. "Working posture" is the most severe, highlighting posture's role. Survey insights emphasize "Job insecurity," "Effort reward imbalance," and "Poor employee facility" as significant contributors. Rankings offer actionable insights for MSD prevention. The study suggests targeted interventions, workplace improvements, and future research directions. This integrated NLP and ranking approach enhances MSD comprehension and informs occupational health strategies.</description>

      <title>Robustly overfitting latents for flexible neural image compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural image compression has made a great deal of progress. State-of-the-art models are based on variational autoencoders and are outperforming classical models. Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA. We show how our method improves the overall compression performance in terms of the R-D trade-off, compared to its predecessors. Additionally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on both the Tecnick and CLIC dataset. Our method is deployed for a pre-trained hyperprior and for a more flexible model. Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Finally, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Matroid Optimization through Fast Imprecise Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Querying complex models for precise information (e.g. traffic models, database systems, large ML models) often entails intense computations and results in long response times. Thus, weaker models which give imprecise results quickly can be advantageous, provided inaccuracies can be resolved using few queries to a stronger model. In the fundamental problem of computing a maximum-weight basis of a matroid, a well-known generalization of many combinatorial optimization problems, algorithms have access to a clean oracle to query matroid information. We additionally equip algorithms with a fast but dirty oracle modelling an unknown, potentially different matroid. We design and analyze practical algorithms which only use few clean queries w.r.t. the quality of the dirty oracle, while maintaining robustness against arbitrarily poor dirty matroids, approaching the performance of classic algorithms for the given problem. Notably, we prove that our algorithms are, in many respects, best-possible. Further, we outline extensions to other matroid oracle types, non-free dirty oracles and other matroid problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Preference Alignment Remedies Degradation of Visual Instruction Tuning on Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities in production. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets with which the underlying language model was trained. To address this degradation, we first collect a lightweight, 5k-sample VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for five quality metrics in a granular fashion and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SteerLM algorithms. Our findings indicate that with DPO, we can surpass the instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99. This enhancement in textual instruction-following capability correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\% on MM-Vet, +6\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to the previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that restores and boosts MLLM's language capability after visual instruction tuning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Negative Prompts for Enhanced Aesthetics and Fidelity in Text-To-Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In text-to-image generation, using negative prompts, which describe undesirable image characteristics, can significantly boost image quality. However, producing good negative prompts is manual and tedious. To address this, we propose NegOpt, a novel method for optimizing negative prompt generation toward enhanced image generation, using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our combined approach results in a substantial increase of 25% in Inception Score compared to other approaches and surpasses ground-truth negative prompts from the test set. Furthermore, with NegOpt we can preferentially optimize the metrics most important to us. Finally, we construct Negative Prompts DB (https://huggingface.co/datasets/mikeogezi/negopt_full), a publicly available dataset of negative prompts.</description>

      <title>Attention-based Class-Conditioned Alignment for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation of Object Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain adaptation methods for object detection (OD) strive to mitigate the impact of distribution shifts by promoting feature alignment across source and target domains. Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) allows leveraging multiple annotated source datasets and unlabeled target data to improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection model. Most state-of-the-art MSDA methods for OD perform feature alignment in a class-agnostic manner. This is challenging since the objects have unique modal information due to variations in object appearance across domains. A recent prototype-based approach proposed a class-wise alignment, yet it suffers from error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels that can negatively affect adaptation with imbalanced data. To overcome these limitations, we propose an attention-based class-conditioned alignment method for MSDA that aligns instances of each object category across domains. In particular, an attention module coupled with an adversarial domain classifier allows learning domain-invariant and class-specific instance representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking MSDA datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to class imbalance using a conceptually simple class-conditioning method. Our code is available at https://github.com/imatif17/ACIA.</description>

      <title>Evaluation and Improvement of Fault Detection for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved significant success across various application domains, garnering substantial attention from different communities. Unfortunately, even for the best LLM, many \textit{faults} still exist that LLM cannot properly predict. Such faults will harm the usability of LLMs in general and could introduce safety issues in reliability-critical systems such as autonomous driving systems. How to quickly reveal these faults in real-world datasets that LLM could face is important, but challenging. The major reason is that the ground truth is necessary but the data labeling process is heavy considering the time and human effort. To handle this problem, in the conventional deep learning testing field, test selection methods have been proposed for efficiently evaluating deep learning models by prioritizing faults. However, despite their importance, the usefulness of these methods on LLMs is unclear, and lack of exploration. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of existing fault detection methods for LLMs. Experimental results on four different tasks~(including both code tasks and natural language processing tasks) and four LLMs~(e.g., LLaMA3 and GPT4) demonstrated that simple methods such as Margin perform well on LLMs but there is still a big room for improvement. Based on the study, we further propose \textbf{MuCS}, a prompt \textbf{Mu}tation-based prediction \textbf{C}onfidence \textbf{S}moothing framework to boost the fault detection capability of existing methods. Concretely, multiple prompt mutation techniques have been proposed to help collect more diverse outputs for confidence smoothing. The results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances existing methods with the improvement of test relative coverage by up to 70.53\%.</description>

      <title>Optimal Matrix Sketching over Sliding Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix sketching, aimed at approximating a matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times d}$ consisting of vector streams of length $N$ with a smaller sketching matrix $\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell\times d}, \ell \ll N$, has garnered increasing attention in fields such as large-scale data analytics and machine learning. A well-known deterministic matrix sketching method is the Frequent Directions algorithm, which achieves the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound and provides a covariance error guarantee of $\varepsilon = \lVert \boldsymbol{A}^\top \boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{B}^\top \boldsymbol{B} \rVert_2/\lVert \boldsymbol{A} \rVert_F^2$. The matrix sketching problem becomes particularly interesting in the context of sliding windows, where the goal is to approximate the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}_W$, formed by input vectors over the most recent $N$ time units. However, despite recent efforts, whether achieving the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound on sliding windows is possible has remained an open question.
  In this paper, we introduce the DS-FD algorithm, which achieves the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound for matrix sketching over row-normalized, sequence-based sliding windows. We also present matching upper and lower space bounds for time-based and unnormalized sliding windows, demonstrating the generality and optimality of \dsfd across various sliding window models. This conclusively answers the open question regarding the optimal space bound for matrix sketching over sliding windows. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating our theoretical claims and thus confirming the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithm, both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free deterministic equivalents and scaling laws for random feature regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension -- allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate.</description>

      <title>Grammar-Aligned Decoding</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper, we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous agents that control computer interfaces to accomplish human tasks are emerging. Leveraging LLMs to power such agents has been of special interest, but unless fine-tuned on human-collected task demonstrations, performance is still relatively low. In this work we study whether fine-tuning alone is a viable approach for building real-world computer control agents. In particularly, we investigate how performance measured on both high and low-level tasks in domain and out of domain scales as more training data is collected. To this end we collect and release a new dataset, AndroidControl, consisting of 15,283 demonstrations of everyday tasks with Android apps. Compared to existing datasets, each AndroidControl task instance includes both high and low-level human-generated instructions, allowing us to explore the level of task complexity an agent can handle. Moreover, AndroidControl is the most diverse computer control dataset to date, including 14,548 unique tasks over 833 Android apps, thus allowing us to conduct in-depth analysis of the model performance in and out of the domain of the training data. Using the dataset, we find that when tested in domain fine-tuned models outperform zero and few-shot baselines and scale in such a way that robust performance might feasibly be obtained simply by collecting more data. Out of domain, performance scales significantly more slowly and suggests that in particular for high-level tasks, fine-tuning on more data alone may be insufficient for achieving robust out-of-domain performance.</description>

      <title>PaCE: Parsimonious Concept Engineering for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used for a wide variety of tasks. While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable outputs via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE), a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Then, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activations as linear combinations of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activations, we reorient the behavior of the LLM towards the alignment goal. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is crucial in joint decision-making systems for rendering holistic judgments. Since multimodal data changes in open environments, dynamic fusion has emerged and achieved remarkable progress in numerous applications. However, most existing dynamic multimodal fusion methods lack theoretical guarantees and easily fall into suboptimal problems, yielding unreliability and instability. To address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono- and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Accordingly, we further propose a relative calibration strategy to calibrate the predicted Co-Belief for potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm our superiority.

      <title>GemNet: Menu-Based, Strategy-Proof Multi-Bidder Auctions Through Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated mechanism design (AMD) uses computational methods for mechanism design. Differentiable economics is a form of AMD that uses deep learning to learn mechanism designs and has enabled strong progress in AMD in recent years. Nevertheless, a major open problem has been to learn multi-bidder, general, and fully strategy-proof (SP) auctions. We introduce GEneral Menu-based NETwork (GemNet), which significantly extends the menu-based approach of the single-bidder RochetNet (D\"utting et al., 2024) to the multi-bidder setting. The challenge in achieving SP is to learn bidder-independent menus that are feasible, so that the optimal menu choices for each bidder do not over-allocate items when taken together (we call this menu compatibility). GemNet penalizes the failure of menu compatibility during training, and transforms learned menus after training through price changes, by considering a set of discretized bidder values and reasoning about Lipschitz smoothness to guarantee menu compatibility on the entire value space. This approach is general, leaving trained menus that already satisfy menu compatibility undisturbed and reducing to RochetNet for a single bidder. Mixed-integer linear programs are used for menu transforms, and through a number of optimizations enabled by deep learning, including adaptive grids and methods to skip menu elements, we scale to large auction design problems. GemNet learns auctions with better revenue than affine maximization methods, achieves exact SP whereas previous general multi-bidder methods are approximately SP, and offers greatly enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>DEM: Distribution Edited Model for Training with Mixed Data Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training with mixed data distributions is a common and important part of creating multi-task and instruction-following models. The diversity of the data distributions and cost of joint training makes the optimization procedure extremely challenging. Data mixing methods partially address this problem, albeit having a sub-optimal performance across data sources and require multiple expensive training runs. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient alternative for better optimization of the data sources by combining models individually trained on each data source with the base model using basic element-wise vector operations. The resulting model, namely Distribution Edited Model (DEM), is 11x cheaper than standard data mixing and outperforms strong baselines on a variety of benchmarks, yielding upto 6.2% improvement on MMLU, 11.5% on BBH, 16.1% on DROP, 6% on MathQA, and 9.3% on HELM with models of size 3B to 13B. Notably, DEM does not require full re-training when modifying a single data-source, thus making it very flexible and scalable for training with diverse data sources.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>Safe Unlearning: A Surprisingly Effective and Generalizable Solution to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions without any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B from 82.6% to 7.7% on out-of-distribution (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts . This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM). Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/SafeUnlearning}.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</description>

      <title>D3: Deep Deconvolution Deblurring for Natural Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to reformulate the blind image deblurring task to directly learn an inverse of the degradation model represented by a deep linear network. We introduce Deep Identity Learning (DIL), a novel learning strategy that includes a dedicated regularization term based on the properties of linear systems, to exploit the identity relation between the degradation and inverse degradation models. The salient aspect of our proposed framework is it neither relies on a deblurring dataset nor a single input blurry image (e.g. Polyblur, a self-supervised method). This framework detours the typical degradation kernel estimation step involved in most of the existing blind deblurring solutions by the proposition of our Random Kernel Gallery (RKG) dataset. The proposed approach extends our previous Image Super-Resolution (ISR) work, NSSR-DIL, to the image deblurring task. In this work, we updated the regularization term in DIL based on Fourier transform properties of the identity relation, to deliver robust performance across a wide range of degradations. Besides the regularization term, we provide an explicit and compact representation of the learned deep linear network in a matrix form, called Deep Restoration Kernel (DRK) to perform image restoration. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional and deep learning based deblurring methods, with at least an order of 100 lesser computational resources. The D3 model, both LCNN &amp; DRK, can be effortlessly extended to the Image Super-Resolution (ISR) task as well to restore the low-resolution images with fine details. The D3 model and its kernel form representation (DRK) are lightweight yet robust and restore the blurry input in a fraction of a second.</description>

      <title>The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.</description>

      <title>Understanding Transformers via N-gram Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer based large-language models (LLMs) display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for 79% and 68% of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories and Wikipedia, respectively, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our N-gram rulesets.</description>

      <title>OxonFair: A Flexible Toolkit for Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OxonFair, a new open source toolkit for enforcing fairness in binary classification. Compared to existing toolkits: (i) We support NLP and Computer Vision classification as well as standard tabular problems. (ii) We support enforcing fairness on validation data, making us robust to a wide range of overfitting challenges. (iii) Our approach can optimize any measure based on True Positives, False Positive, False Negatives, and True Negatives. This makes it easily extensible and much more expressive than existing toolkits. It supports all 9 and all 10 of the decision-based group metrics of two popular review articles. (iv) We jointly optimize a performance objective alongside fairness constraints. This minimizes degradation while enforcing fairness, and even improves the performance of inadequately tuned unfair baselines. OxonFair is compatible with standard ML toolkits, including sklearn, Autogluon, and PyTorch and is available at https://github.com/oxfordinternetinstitute/oxonfair</description>

      <title>Piecewise deterministic generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of generative models based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a family of non-diffusive stochastic processes consisting of deterministic motion and random jumps at random times. Similarly to diffusions, such Markov processes admit time reversals that turn out to be PDMPs as well. We apply this observation to three PDMPs considered in the literature: the Zig-Zag process, Bouncy Particle Sampler, and Randomised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For these three particular instances, we show that the jump rates and kernels of the corresponding time reversals admit explicit expressions depending on some conditional densities of the PDMP under consideration before and after a jump. Based on these results, we propose efficient training procedures to learn these characteristics and consider methods to approximately simulate the reverse process. Finally, we provide bounds in the total variation distance between the data distribution and the resulting distribution of our model in the case where the base distribution is the standard $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Promising numerical simulations support further investigations into this class of models.</description>

      <title>Target Detection of Safety Protective Gear Using the Improved YOLOv5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-risk railway construction, personal protective equipment monitoring is critical but challenging due to small and frequently obstructed targets. We propose YOLO-EA, an innovative model that enhances safety measure detection by integrating ECA into its backbone's convolutional layers, improving discernment of minuscule objects like hardhats. YOLO-EA further refines target recognition under occlusion by replacing GIoU with EIoU loss. YOLO-EA's effectiveness was empirically substantiated using a dataset derived from real-world railway construction site surveillance footage. It outperforms YOLOv5, achieving 98.9% precision and 94.7% recall, up 2.5% and 0.5% respectively, while maintaining real-time performance at 70.774 fps. This highly efficient and precise YOLO-EA holds great promise for practical application in intricate construction scenarios, enforcing stringent safety compliance during complex railway construction projects.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a refined differentially private (DP) data structure for kernel density estimation (KDE), offering not only improved privacy-utility tradeoff but also better efficiency over prior results. Specifically, we study the mathematical problem: given a similarity function $f$ (or DP KDE) and a private dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, our goal is to preprocess $X$ so that for any query $y\in\mathbb{R}^d$, we approximate $\sum_{x \in X} f(x, y)$ in a differentially private fashion. The best previous algorithm for $f(x,y) =\| x - y \|_1$ is the node-contaminated balanced binary tree by [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. Their algorithm requires $O(nd)$ space and time for preprocessing with $n=|X|$. For any query point, the query time is $d \log n$, with an error guarantee of $(1+\alpha)$-approximation and $\epsilon^{-1} \alpha^{-0.5} d^{1.5} R \log^{1.5} n$.
  In this paper, we improve the best previous result [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024] in three aspects:
  - We reduce query time by a factor of $\alpha^{-1} \log n$.
  - We improve the approximation ratio from $\alpha$ to 1.
  - We reduce the error dependence by a factor of $\alpha^{-0.5}$.
  From a technical perspective, our method of constructing the search tree differs from previous work [Backurs, Lin, Mahabadi, Silwal, and Tarnawski, ICLR 2024]. In prior work, for each query, the answer is split into $\alpha^{-1} \log n$ numbers, each derived from the summation of $\log n$ values in interval tree countings. In contrast, we construct the tree differently, splitting the answer into $\log n$ numbers, where each is a smart combination of two distance values, two counting values, and $y$ itself. We believe our tree structure may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Introducing Perturb-ability Score (PS) to Enhance Robustness Against Evasion Adversarial Attacks on ML-NIDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As network security threats continue to evolve, safeguarding Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS) metric that identifies NIDS features susceptible to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. By quantifying a feature's susceptibility to perturbations within the problem-space, the PS facilitates the selection of features that are inherently more robust against evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS during the feature selection phase. These features exhibit natural resilience to perturbations, as they are heavily constrained by the problem-space limitations and correlations of the NIDS domain. Furthermore, manipulating these features may either disrupt the malicious function of evasion adversarial attacks on NIDS or render the network traffic invalid for processing (or both). This proposed novel approach employs a fresh angle by leveraging network domain constraints as a defense mechanism against problem-space evasion adversarial attacks targeting ML-NIDS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-guided feature selection defense in enhancing NIDS robustness. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that selecting only robust features (low-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Additionally, our findings verify that the PS effectively identifies NIDS features highly vulnerable to problem-space perturbations.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Lie Group Orientations for Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling orientations of robots and objects is a crucial aspect of many applications. Yet, ever so often, there is a lack of mathematical correctness when dealing with orientations, especially in learning pipelines involving, for example, artificial neural networks. In this paper, we investigate reinforcement learning with orientations and propose a simple modification of the network's input and output that adheres to the Lie group structure of orientations. As a result, we obtain an easy and efficient implementation that is directly usable with existing learning libraries and achieves significantly better performance than other common orientation representations. We briefly introduce Lie theory specifically for orientations in robotics to motivate and outline our approach. Subsequently, a thorough empirical evaluation of different combinations of orientation representations for states and actions demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed approach in different scenarios, including: direct orientation control, end effector orientation control, and pick-and-place tasks.</description>

      <title>A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation for popular programming languages. However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets.
  Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation.
  We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.</description>

      <title>DAAL: Density-Aware Adaptive Line Margin Loss for Multi-Modal Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal deep metric learning is crucial for effectively capturing diverse representations in tasks such as face verification, fine-grained object recognition, and product search. Traditional approaches to metric learning, whether based on distance or margin metrics, primarily emphasize class separation, often overlooking the intra-class distribution essential for multi-modal feature learning. In this context, we propose a novel loss function called Density-Aware Adaptive Margin Loss(DAAL), which preserves the density distribution of embeddings while encouraging the formation of adaptive sub-clusters within each class. By employing an adaptive line strategy, DAAL not only enhances intra-class variance but also ensures robust inter-class separation, facilitating effective multi-modal representation. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark fine-grained datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DAAL, underscoring its potential in advancing retrieval applications and multi-modal deep metric learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes statistical properties of deep neural network (DNN) estimators under dependent data. Two general results for nonparametric sieve estimators directly applicable to DNN estimators are given. The first establishes rates for convergence in probability under nonstationary data. The second provides non-asymptotic probability bounds on $\mathcal{L}^{2}$-errors under stationary $\beta$-mixing data. I apply these results to DNN estimators in both regression and classification contexts imposing only a standard H\"older smoothness assumption. The DNN architectures considered are common in applications, featuring fully connected feedforward networks with any continuous piecewise linear activation function, unbounded weights, and a width and depth that grows with sample size. The framework provided also offers potential for research into other DNN architectures and time-series applications.</description>

      <title>Mini-Omni2: Towards Open-source GPT-4o with Vision, Speech and Duplex Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPT-4o, an all-encompassing model, represents a milestone in the development of large multi-modal language models. It can understand visual, auditory, and textual modalities, directly output audio, and support flexible duplex interaction. Models from the open-source community often achieve some functionalities of GPT-4o, such as visual understanding and voice chat. Nevertheless, training a unified model that incorporates all modalities is challenging due to the complexities of multi-modal data, intricate model architectures, and training processes. In this paper, we introduce Mini-Omni2, a visual-audio assistant capable of providing real-time, end-to-end voice responses to visoin and audio queries. By integrating pretrained visual and auditory encoders, Mini-Omni2 maintains performance in individual modalities. We propose a three-stage training process to align modalities, allowing the language model to handle multi-modal inputs and outputs after training on a limited dataset. For interaction, we introduce a command-based interruption mechanism, enabling more flexible interaction with users. To the best of our knowledge, Mini-Omni2 is one of the closest reproductions of GPT-4o, which have similar form of functionality, and we hope it can offer valuable insights for subsequent research.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Importance Matters: Less Memory for Better Performance in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant popularity for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, primarily due to their potential to significantly reduce memory and computational overheads. However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates these selected layers in PEFT modules, leading to reduced memory demands. We further provide theoretical proof of convergence and empirical evidence of superior performance to demonstrate the advantages of IST over uniform updating strategies. Extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, PEFTs, and downstream tasks substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing IST's capacity to enhance existing layer-based PEFT methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Kaiseem/IST.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Misalignment in Vision-Language Model Adaptation from a Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundational Vision-Language models such as CLIP have exhibited impressive generalization in downstream tasks. However, CLIP suffers from a two-level misalignment issue, i.e., task misalignment and data misalignment, when adapting to specific tasks. Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task misalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the impacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation processes of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while we expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately, the task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the modeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted classes. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the front-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks and perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction generated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different settings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC.</description>

      <title>Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the Long-Tail Adjusted Next POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yukayo/LoTNext.</description>

      <title>Using Platt's scaling for calibration after undersampling -- limitations and how to address them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When modelling data where the response is dichotomous and highly imbalanced, response-based sampling where a subset of the majority class is retained (i.e., undersampling) is often used to create more balanced training datasets prior to modelling. However, the models fit to this undersampled data, which we refer to as base models, generate predictions that are severely biased. There are several calibration methods that can be used to combat this bias, one of which is Platt's scaling. Here, a logistic regression model is used to model the relationship between the base model's original predictions and the response. Despite its popularity for calibrating models after undersampling, Platt's scaling was not designed for this purpose. Our work presents what we believe is the first detailed study focused on the validity of using Platt's scaling to calibrate models after undersampling. We show analytically, as well as via a simulation study and a case study, that Platt's scaling should not be used for calibration after undersampling without critical thought. If Platt's scaling would have been able to successfully calibrate the base model had it been trained on the entire dataset (i.e., without undersampling), then Platt's scaling might be appropriate for calibration after undersampling. If this is not the case, we recommend a modified version of Platt's scaling that fits a logistic generalized additive model to the logit of the base model's predictions, as it is both theoretically motivated and performed well across the settings considered in our study.</description>

      <title>Dialog2Flow: Pre-training Soft-Contrastive Action-Driven Sentence Embeddings for Automatic Dialog Flow Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently deriving structured workflows from unannotated dialogs remains an underexplored and formidable challenge in computational linguistics. Automating this process could significantly accelerate the manual design of workflows in new domains and enable the grounding of large language models in domain-specific flowcharts, enhancing transparency and controllability. In this paper, we introduce Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which differ from conventional sentence embeddings by mapping utterances to a latent space where they are grouped according to their communicative and informative functions (i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as continuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions. By clustering D2F embeddings, the latent space is quantized, and dialogs can be converted into sequences of region/action IDs, facilitating the extraction of the underlying workflow. To pre-train D2F, we build a comprehensive dataset by unifying twenty task-oriented dialog datasets with normalized per-turn action annotations. We also introduce a novel soft contrastive loss that leverages the semantic information of these actions to guide the representation learning process, showing superior performance compared to standard supervised contrastive loss. Evaluation against various sentence embeddings, including dialog-specific ones, demonstrates that D2F yields superior qualitative and quantitative results across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Assured Automatic Programming via Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of AI-based coding engines, it is possible to convert natural language requirements to executable code in standard programming languages. However, AI-generated code can be unreliable, and the natural language requirements driving this code may be ambiguous. In other words, the intent may not be accurately captured in the code generated from AI-coding engines like Copilot. The goal of our work is to discover the programmer intent, while generating code which conforms to the intent and a proof of this conformance. Our approach to intent discovery is powered by a novel repair engine called program-proof co-evolution, where the object of repair is a tuple (code, logical specification, test) generated by an LLM from the same natural language description. The program and the specification capture the initial operational and declarative description of intent, while the test represents a concrete, albeit partial, understanding of the intent. Our objective is to achieve consistency between the program, the specification, and the test by incrementally refining our understanding of the user intent. Reaching consistency through this repair process provides us with a formal, logical description of the intent, which is then translated back into natural language for the developer's inspection. The resultant intent description is now unambiguous, though expressed in natural language. We demonstrate how the unambiguous intent discovered through our approach increases the percentage of verifiable auto-generated programs on a recently proposed dataset in the Dafny programming language.</description>

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>

      <title>Decoding Diffusion: A Scalable Framework for Unsupervised Analysis of Latent Space Biases and Representations Using Natural Language Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have made diffusion models powerful tools for creating high-quality images. However, their iterative denoising process makes understanding and interpreting their semantic latent spaces more challenging than other generative models, such as GANs. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by identifying semantically meaningful directions within the latent space. However, they often need manual interpretation or are limited in the number of vectors that can be trained, restricting their scope and utility. This paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised exploration of diffusion latent spaces. We directly leverage natural language prompts and image captions to map latent directions. This method allows for the automatic understanding of hidden features and supports a broader range of analysis without the need to train specific vectors. Our method provides a more scalable and interpretable understanding of the semantic knowledge encoded within diffusion models, facilitating comprehensive analysis of latent biases and the nuanced representations these models learn. Experimental results show that our framework can uncover hidden patterns and associations in various domains, offering new insights into the interpretability of diffusion model latent spaces.</description>

      <title>Repository-Level Compositional Code Translation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc.
  We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of &lt;836, 8575, 2719&gt; classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans translated the entire repository of these projects consisting of 6899 source code fragments. 99.1% of the translated code fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 25.8%. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 36 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the syntactically or semantically incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</description>

      <title>Birdie: Advancing State Space Models with Reward-Driven Objectives and Curricula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks and linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers but struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text copying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts. Previous efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural modifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the in-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture. Our approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of specialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We introduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from bidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive tasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph question-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with Transformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of SSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities. All code and pre-trained models are available at https://www.github.com/samblouir/birdie, with support for JAX and PyTorch.</description>

      <title>Privacy Risks of Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding in large language models (LLMs) accelerates token generation by speculatively predicting multiple tokens cheaply and verifying them in parallel, and has been widely deployed. In this paper, we provide the first study demonstrating the privacy risks of speculative decoding. We observe that input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect predictions can be leaked out to an adversary monitoring token generation times and packet sizes, leading to privacy breaches. By observing the pattern of correctly and incorrectly speculated tokens, we show that a malicious adversary can fingerprint queries and learn private user inputs with more than $90\%$ accuracy across three different speculative decoding techniques - REST (almost $100\%$ accuracy), LADE (up to $92\%$ accuracy), and BiLD (up to $95\%$ accuracy). We show that an adversary can also leak out confidential intellectual property used to design these techniques, such as data from data-stores used for prediction (in REST) at a rate of more than $25$ tokens per second, or even hyper-parameters used for prediction (in LADE). We also discuss mitigation strategies, such as aggregating tokens across multiple iterations and padding packets with additional bytes, to avoid such privacy or confidentiality breaches.</description>

      <title>Music Foundation Model as Generic Booster for Music Downstream Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the efficacy of using intermediate representations from a single foundation model to enhance various music downstream tasks. We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws with Hidden Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical learning in high-dimensional spaces is challenging without a strong underlying data structure. Recent advances with foundational models suggest that text and image data contain such hidden structures, which help mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Inspired by results from nonparametric statistics, we hypothesize that this phenomenon can be partially explained in terms of decomposition of complex tasks into simpler subtasks. In this paper, we present a controlled experimental framework to test whether neural networks can indeed exploit such ``hidden factorial structures.'' We find that they do leverage these latent patterns to learn discrete distributions more efficiently, and derive scaling laws linking model sizes, hidden factorizations, and accuracy. We also study the interplay between our structural assumptions and the models' capacity for generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, traditional evaluation metrics tend to saturate, making it challenging to distinguish between models based on their performance. We propose a general method to transform existing LLM evaluations into a series of progressively more difficult tasks. These enhanced evaluations emphasize reasoning capabilities and can reveal relative performance differences that are not apparent in the original assessments.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we create a new multiple-choice test corpus, extend it into a family of evaluations, and assess a collection of LLMs. Our results offer insights into the comparative reasoning abilities of these models, particularly highlighting distinctions between OpenAI's o1-preview and Google's gemini-pro-1.5-002.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the patterns of incorrect answers produced by large language models (LLMs) during evaluation. These errors exhibit highly non-intuitive behaviors unique to each model. By analyzing these patterns, we measure the similarities between LLMs and construct a taxonomy that categorizes them based on their error correlations. Our findings reveal that the incorrect responses are not randomly distributed but systematically correlated across models, providing new insights into the underlying structures and relationships among LLMs.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms. We prove the separation for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Temperature-Dependent CMC of Surfactant Mixtures with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02224</link>

Abstract: Surfactants are key ingredients in foaming and cleansing products across various industries such as personal and home care, industrial cleaning, and more, with the critical micelle concentration (CMC) being of major interest. Predictive models for CMC of pure surfactants have been developed based on recent ML methods, however, in practice surfactant mixtures are typically used due to to performance, environmental, and cost reasons. This requires accounting for synergistic/antagonistic interactions between surfactants; however, predictive ML models for a wide spectrum of mixtures are missing so far. Herein, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) framework for surfactant mixtures to predict the temperature-dependent CMC. We collect data for 108 surfactant binary mixtures, to which we add data for pure species from our previous work [Brozos et al. (2024), J. Chem. Theory Comput.]. We then develop and train GNNs and evaluate their accuracy across different prediction test scenarios for binary mixtures relevant to practical applications. The final GNN models demonstrate very high predictive performance when interpolating between different mixture compositions and for new binary mixtures with known species. Extrapolation to binary surfactant mixtures where either one or both surfactant species are not seen before, yields accurate results for the majority of surfactant systems. We further find superior accuracy of the GNN over a semi-empirical model based on activity coefficients, which has been widely used to date. We then explore if GNN models trained solely on binary mixture and pure species data can also accurately predict the CMCs of ternary mixtures. Finally, we experimentally measure the CMC of 4 commercial surfactants that contain up to four species and industrial relevant mixtures and find a very good agreement between measured and predicted CMC values.</description>
