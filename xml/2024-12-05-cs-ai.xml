      <title>ECG-SleepNet: Deep Learning-Based Comprehensive Sleep Stage Classification Using ECG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for understanding sleep disorders and improving overall health. This study proposes a novel three-stage approach for sleep stage classification using ECG signals, offering a more accessible alternative to traditional methods that often rely on complex modalities like EEG. In Stages 1 and 2, we initialize the weights of two networks, which are then integrated in Stage 3 for comprehensive classification. In the first phase, we estimate key features using Feature Imitating Networks (FINs) to achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence. The second phase focuses on identifying the N1 sleep stage through the time-frequency representation of ECG signals. Finally, the third phase integrates models from the previous stages and employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to classify five distinct sleep stages. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, particularly SMOTE, are used in enhancing classification capabilities for underrepresented stages like N1. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the classification performance, with an overall accuracy of 80.79% an overall kappa of 0.73. The model achieves specific accuracies of 86.70% for Wake, 60.36% for N1, 83.89% for N2, 84.85% for N3, and 87.16% for REM. This study emphasizes the importance of weight initialization and data augmentation in optimizing sleep stage classification with ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Network on PICTURE Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) provide critical care and life support for most severely ill and injured patients in the hospital. With the need for ICUs growing rapidly and unprecedentedly, especially during COVID-19, accurately identifying the most critical patients helps hospitals to allocate resources more efficiently and save more lives. The Predicting Intensive Care Transfers and Other Unforeseen Events (PICTURE) model predicts patient deterioration by separating those at high risk for imminent intensive care unit transfer, respiratory failure, or death from those at lower risk. This study aims to implement a deep learning model to benchmark the performance from the XGBoost model, an existing model which has competitive results on prediction.</description>

      <title>Approximately Optimal Search on a Higher-dimensional Sliding Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional sliding puzzles are constructed on the vertices of a $d$-dimensional hypercube, where $2^d-l$ vertices are distinctly coloured. Rings with the same colours are initially set randomly on the vertices of the hypercube. The goal of the puzzle is to move each of the $2^d-l$ rings to pre-defined target vertices on the cube. In this setting, the $k$-rule constraint represents a generalisation of edge collision for the movement of colours between vertices, allowing movement only when a hypercube face of dimension $k$ containing a ring is completely free of other rings. Starting from an initial configuration, what is the minimum number of moves needed to make ring colours match the vertex colours? An algorithm that provides us with such a number is called God's algorithm. When such an algorithm exists, it does not have a polynomial time complexity, at least in the case of the 15-puzzle corresponding to $k=1$ in the cubical puzzle. This paper presents a comprehensive computational study of different scenarios of the higher-dimensional puzzle. A benchmark of three computational techniques, an exact algorithm (the A* search) and two approximately optimal search techniques (an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and reinforcement learning (RL)) is presented in this work. The experiments show that all three methods can successfully solve the puzzle of dimension three for different face dimensions and across various difficulty levels. When the dimension increases, the A* search fails, and RL and EA methods can still provide a generally acceptable solution, i.e. a distribution of a number of moves with a median value of less than $30$. Overall, the EA method consistently requires less computational time, while failing in most cases to minimise the number of moves for the puzzle dimensions $d=4$ and $d=5$.</description>

      <title>The Reality of AI and Biorisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately and confidently answer the question 'could an AI model or system increase biorisk', it is necessary to have both a sound theoretical threat model for how AI models or systems could increase biorisk and a robust method for testing that threat model. This paper provides an analysis of existing available research surrounding two AI and biorisk threat models: 1) access to information and planning via large language models (LLMs), and 2) the use of AI-enabled biological tools (BTs) in synthesizing novel biological artifacts. We find that existing studies around AI-related biorisk are nascent, often speculative in nature, or limited in terms of their methodological maturity and transparency. The available literature suggests that current LLMs and BTs do not pose an immediate risk, and more work is needed to develop rigorous approaches to understanding how future models could increase biorisks. We end with recommendations about how empirical work can be expanded to more precisely target biorisk and ensure rigor and validity of findings.</description>

      <title>The Evolution and Future Perspectives of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC), a rapidly advancing technology, is transforming content creation across domains, such as text, images, audio, and video. Its growing potential has attracted more and more researchers and investors to explore and expand its possibilities. This review traces AIGC's evolution through four developmental milestones-ranging from early rule-based systems to modern transfer learning models-within a unified framework that highlights how each milestone contributes uniquely to content generation. In particular, the paper employs a common example across all milestones to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of methods within each phase, providing a consistent evaluation of AIGC methodologies and their development. Furthermore, this paper addresses critical challenges associated with AIGC and proposes actionable strategies to mitigate them. This study aims to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting and optimizing AIGC models to enhance the quality and efficiency of content creation across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Self-Improvement in Language Models: The Sharpening Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of self-improvement, where a language models evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample access, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families of self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF.</description>

      <title>Usage Governance Advisor: from Intent to AI Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the safety of AI Systems is a pressing concern for organizations deploying them. In addition to the societal damage done by the lack of fairness of those systems, deployers are concerned about the legal repercussions and the reputational damage incurred by the use of models that are unsafe. Safety covers both what a model does; e.g., can it be used to reveal personal information from its training set, and how a model was built; e.g., was it only trained on licensed data sets. Determining the safety of an AI system requires gathering information from a wide set of heterogeneous sources including safety benchmarks and technical documentation for the set of models used in that system. In addition, responsible use is encouraged through mechanisms that advise and help the user to take mitigating actions where safety risks are detected. We present Usage Governance Advisor which creates semi-structured governance information, identifies and prioritizes risks according to the intended use case, recommends appropriate benchmarks and risk assessments and importantly proposes mitigation strategies and actions.</description>

      <title>LLMs4Life: Large Language Models for Ontology Learning in Life Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology learning in complex domains, such as life sciences, poses significant challenges for current Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing LLMs struggle to generate ontologies with multiple hierarchical levels, rich interconnections, and comprehensive class coverage due to constraints on the number of tokens they can generate and inadequate domain adaptation. To address these issues, we extend the NeOn-GPT pipeline for ontology learning using LLMs with advanced prompt engineering techniques and ontology reuse to enhance the generated ontologies' domain-specific reasoning and structural depth. Our work evaluates the capabilities of LLMs in ontology learning in the context of highly specialized and complex domains such as life science domains. To assess the logical consistency, completeness, and scalability of the generated ontologies, we use the AquaDiva ontology developed and used in the collaborative research center AquaDiva as a case study. Our evaluation shows the viability of LLMs for ontology learning in specialized domains, providing solutions to longstanding limitations in model performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>Construction and optimization of health behavior prediction model for the elderly in smart elderly care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the intensification of global aging, health management of the elderly has become a focus of social attention. This study designs and implements a smart elderly care service model to address issues such as data diversity, health status complexity, long-term dependence and data loss, sudden changes in behavior, and data privacy in the prediction of health behaviors of the elderly. The model achieves accurate prediction and dynamic management of health behaviors of the elderly through modules such as multimodal data fusion, data loss processing, nonlinear prediction, emergency detection, and privacy protection. In the experimental design, based on multi-source data sets and market research results, the model demonstrates excellent performance in health behavior prediction, emergency detection, and personalized services. The experimental results show that the model can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of health behavior prediction and meet the actual application needs in the field of smart elderly care. In the future, with the integration of more data and further optimization of technology, the model will provide more powerful technical support for smart elderly care services.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Social Cost in Multi-Agent General Reinforcement Learning: Survey and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI safety literature is full of examples of powerful AI agents that, in blindly pursuing a specific and usually narrow objective, ends up with unacceptable and even catastrophic collateral damage to others. In this paper, we consider the problem of social harms that can result from actions taken by learning and utility-maximising agents in a multi-agent environment. The problem of measuring social harms or impacts in such multi-agent settings, especially when the agents are artificial generally intelligent (AGI) agents, was listed as an open problem in Everitt et al, 2018. We attempt a partial answer to that open problem in the form of market-based mechanisms to quantify and control the cost of such social harms. The proposed setup captures many well-studied special cases and is more general than existing formulations of multi-agent reinforcement learning with mechanism design in two ways: (i) the underlying environment is a history-based general reinforcement learning environment like in AIXI; (ii) the reinforcement-learning agents participating in the environment can have different learning strategies and planning horizons. To demonstrate the practicality of the proposed setup, we survey some key classes of learning algorithms and present a few applications, including a discussion of the Paperclips problem and pollution control with a cap-and-trade system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their widespread adoption has raised concerns pertaining to trust and safety. This systematic review investigates the current research landscape on trust and safety in LLMs, with a particular focus on the novel application of LLMs within the field of Trust and Safety itself. We delve into the complexities of utilizing LLMs in domains where maintaining trust and safety is paramount, offering a consolidated perspective on this emerging trend.\
  By synthesizing findings from various studies, we identify key challenges and potential solutions, aiming to benefit researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the nuanced interplay between LLMs and Trust and Safety.
  This review provides insights on best practices for using LLMs in Trust and Safety, and explores emerging risks such as prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how LLMs can be effectively and responsibly utilized to enhance trust and safety in the digital realm.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Latent Goal by Learning from Trajectory Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies for open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human intentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to the initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best instructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT allows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to collect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and negative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to fine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized trajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result shows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative improvement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies respectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover, PGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution environments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong generalization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent representation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient method for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or task interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across nearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates robustness to the execution environment.</description>

      <title>A privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion algorithm for collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of evidence reasoning has been applied to collective decision-making in recent years. However, existing distributed evidence fusion methods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they directly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like centralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a privacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level consensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure (EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among neighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic probability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective probabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible evidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are inferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear average consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to guarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence in numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving LAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each agent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such randomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the convergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is impossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that PCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher decision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Learning for Planning: The Story Thus Far and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph learning is naturally well suited for use in planning due to its ability to exploit relational structures exhibited in planning domains and to take as input planning instances with arbitrary number of objects. In this paper, we study the usage of graph learning for planning thus far by studying the theoretical and empirical effects on learning and planning performance of (1) graph representations of planning tasks, (2) graph learning architectures, and (3) optimisation formulations for learning. Our studies accumulate in the GOOSE framework which learns domain knowledge from small planning tasks in order to scale up to much larger planning tasks. In this paper, we also highlight and propose the 5 open challenges in the general Learning for Planning field that we believe need to be addressed for advancing the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of AI Tools on Student Study Habits and Academic Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of AI tools in enhancing student learning, specifically in improving study habits, time management, and feedback mechanisms. The research focuses on how AI tools can support personalized learning, adaptive test adjustments, and provide real-time classroom analysis. Student feedback revealed strong support for these features, and the study found a significant reduction in study hours alongside an increase in GPA, suggesting positive academic outcomes. Despite these benefits, challenges such as over-reliance on AI and difficulties in integrating AI with traditional teaching methods were also identified, emphasizing the need for AI tools to complement conventional educational strategies rather than replace them. Data were collected through a survey with a Likert scale and follow-up interviews, providing both quantitative and qualitative insights. The analysis involved descriptive statistics to summarize demographic data, AI usage patterns, and perceived effectiveness, as well as inferential statistics (T-tests, ANOVA) to examine the impact of demographic factors on AI adoption. Regression analysis identified predictors of AI adoption, and qualitative responses were thematically analyzed to understand students' perspectives on the future of AI in education. This mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive view of AI's role in education and highlighted the importance of privacy, transparency, and continuous refinement of AI features to maximize their educational benefits.</description>

      <title>Keeping Experts in the Loop: Expert-Guided Optimization for Clinical Data Classification using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), the challenge of effectively leveraging their potential in healthcare has taken center stage. A critical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role in determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization remains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt refinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to create an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or through employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of the input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose StructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the input of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the framework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies high-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance improvements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively enhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling redundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We evaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified clinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared to current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in LLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining minimal expert effort. By combining transparency, flexibility, and scalability, StructEase sets the foundation for a framework to integrate expert input into LLM workflows in healthcare and beyond.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Early Genetic Disorder and Subclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A great deal of effort has been devoted to discovering a particular genetic disorder, but its classification across a broad spectrum of disorder classes and types remains elusive. Early diagnosis of genetic disorders enables timely interventions and improves outcomes. This study implements machine learning models using basic clinical indicators measurable at birth or infancy to enable diagnosis in preliminary life stages. Supervised learning algorithms were implemented on a dataset of 22083 instances with 42 features like family history, newborn metrics, and basic lab tests. Extensive hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and selection were undertaken. Two multi-class classifiers were developed: one for predicting disorder classes (mitochondrial, multifactorial, and single-gene) and one for subtypes (9 disorders). Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. The CatBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 77% for predicting genetic disorder classes. For subtypes, SVM attained a maximum accuracy of 80%. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using basic clinical data in machine learning models for early categorization and diagnosis across various genetic disorders. Applying ML with basic clinical indicators can enable timely interventions once validated on larger datasets. It is necessary to conduct further studies to improve model performance on this dataset.</description>

      <title>Deep learning approach for predicting the replicator equation in evolutionary game theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed deep learning approach for predicting the replicator equation, allowing accurate forecasting of population dynamics. This methodological innovation allows us to derive governing differential or difference equations for systems that lack explicit mathematical models. We used the SINDy model first introduced by Fasel, Kaiser, Kutz, Brunton, and Brunt 2016a to get the replicator equation, which will significantly advance our understanding of evolutionary biology, economic systems, and social dynamics. By refining predictive models across multiple disciplines, including ecology, social structures, and moral behaviours, our work offers new insights into the complex interplay of variables shaping evolutionary outcomes in dynamic systems</description>

      <title>AH-OCDA: Amplitude-based Curriculum Learning and Hopfield Segmentation Model for Open Compound Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) is a practical domain adaptation problem that consists of a source domain, target compound domain, and unseen open domain. In this problem, the absence of domain labels and pixel-level segmentation labels for both compound and open domains poses challenges to the direct application of existing domain adaptation and generalization methods. To address this issue, we propose Amplitude-based curriculum learning and a Hopfield segmentation model for Open Compound Domain Adaptation (AH-OCDA). Our method comprises two complementary components: 1) amplitude-based curriculum learning and 2) Hopfield segmentation model. Without prior knowledge of target domains within the compound domains, amplitude-based curriculum learning gradually induces the semantic segmentation model to adapt from the near-source compound domain to the far-source compound domain by ranking unlabeled compound domain images through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Additionally, the Hopfield segmentation model maps segmentation feature distributions from arbitrary domains to the feature distributions of the source domain. AH-OCDA achieves state-of-the-art performance on two OCDA benchmarks and extended open domains, demonstrating its adaptability to continuously changing compound domains and unseen open domains.</description>

      <title>Large Multimodal Agents for Accurate Phishing Detection with Enhanced Token Optimization and Cost Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of sophisticated phishing attacks, there is a growing need for effective and economical detection solutions. This paper explores the use of large multimodal agents, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini, to analyze both URLs and webpage screenshots via APIs, thus avoiding the complexities of training and maintaining AI systems. Our findings indicate that integrating these two data types substantially enhances detection performance over using either type alone. However, API usage incurs costs per query that depend on the number of input and output tokens. To address this, we propose a two-tiered agentic approach: initially, one agent assesses the URL, and if inconclusive, a second agent evaluates both the URL and the screenshot. This method not only maintains robust detection performance but also significantly reduces API costs by minimizing unnecessary multi-input queries. Cost analysis shows that with the agentic approach, GPT-4o mini can process about 4.2 times as many websites per $100 compared to the multimodal approach (107,440 vs. 25,626), and Gemini 1.5 Flash can process about 2.6 times more websites (2,232,142 vs. 862,068). These findings underscore the significant economic benefits of the agentic approach over the multimodal method, providing a viable solution for organizations aiming to leverage advanced AI for phishing detection while controlling expenses.</description>

      <title>Switchable deep beamformer for high-quality and real-time passive acoustic mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping (PAM) is a promising tool for monitoring acoustic cavitation activities in the applications of ultrasound therapy. Data-adaptive beamformers for PAM have better image quality compared to the time exposure acoustics (TEA) algorithms. However, the computational cost of data-adaptive beamformers is considerably expensive. In this work, we develop a deep beamformer based on a generative adversarial network, which can switch between different transducer arrays and reconstruct high-quality PAM images directly from radio frequency ultrasound signals with low computational cost. The deep beamformer was trained on the dataset consisting of simulated and experimental cavitation signals of single and multiple microbubble clouds measured by different (linear and phased) arrays covering 1-15 MHz. We compared the performance of the deep beamformer to TEA and three different data-adaptive beamformers using the simulated and experimental test dataset. Compared with TEA, the deep beamformer reduced the energy spread area by 18.9%-65.0% and improved the image signal-to-noise ratio by 9.3-22.9 dB in average for the different arrays in our data. Compared to the data-adaptive beamformers, the deep beamformer reduced the computational cost by three orders of magnitude achieving 10.5 ms image reconstruction speed in our data, while the image quality was as good as that of the data-adaptive beamformers. These results demonstrated the potential of the deep beamformer for high-resolution monitoring of microbubble cavitation activities for ultrasound therapy.</description>

      <title>ScImage: How Good Are Multimodal Large Language Models at Scientific Text-to-Image Generation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual instructions. However, their performance in generating scientific images--a critical application for accelerating scientific progress--remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing ScImage, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations, focusing on the relationships between scientific objects (e.g., squares, circles). We evaluate five models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, and StableDiffusion, using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese. Our evaluation, conducted with 11 scientists across three criteria (correctness, relevance, and scientific accuracy), reveals that while GPT-4o produces outputs of decent quality for simpler prompts involving individual dimensions such as spatial, numeric, or attribute understanding in isolation, all models face challenges in this task, especially for more complex prompts.</description>

      <title>Artificial Expert Intelligence through PAC-reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) seeks to transcend the limitations of both Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and narrow AI by integrating domain-specific expertise with critical, precise reasoning capabilities akin to those of top human experts. Existing AI systems often excel at predefined tasks but struggle with adaptability and precision in novel problem-solving. To overcome this, AEI introduces a framework for ``Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Reasoning". This paradigm provides robust theoretical guarantees for reliably decomposing complex problems, with a practical mechanism for controlling reasoning precision. In reference to the division of human thought into System 1 for intuitive thinking and System 2 for reflective reasoning~\citep{tversky1974judgment}, we refer to this new type of reasoning as System 3 for precise reasoning, inspired by the rigor of the scientific method. AEI thus establishes a foundation for error-bounded, inference-time learning.</description>

      <title>F-SE-LSTM: A Time Series Anomaly Detection Method with Frequency Domain Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of society, time series anomaly detection plays an important role in network and IoT services. However, most existing anomaly detection methods directly analyze time series in the time domain and cannot distinguish some relatively hidden anomaly sequences. We attempt to analyze the impact of frequency on time series from a frequency domain perspective, thus proposing a new time series anomaly detection method called F-SE-LSTM. This method utilizes two sliding windows and fast Fourier transform (FFT) to construct a frequency matrix. Simultaneously, Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are employed to extract frequency-related features within and between periods. Through comparative experiments on multiple datasets such as Yahoo Webscope S5 and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark, the results demonstrate that the frequency matrix constructed by F-SE-LSTM exhibits better discriminative ability than ordinary time domain and frequency domain data. Furthermore, F-SE-LSTM outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning anomaly detection methods in terms of anomaly detection capability and execution efficiency.</description>

      <title>Towards Rich Emotions in 3D Avatars: A Text-to-3D Avatar Generation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Producing emotionally dynamic 3D facial avatars with text derived from spoken words (Emo3D) has been a pivotal research topic in 3D avatar generation. While progress has been made in general-purpose 3D avatar generation, the exploration of generating emotional 3D avatars remains scarce, primarily due to the complexities of identifying and rendering rich emotions from spoken words. This paper reexamines Emo3D generation and draws inspiration from human processes, breaking down Emo3D into two cascading steps: Text-to-3D Expression Mapping (T3DEM) and 3D Avatar Rendering (3DAR). T3DEM is the most crucial step in determining the quality of Emo3D generation and encompasses three key challenges: Expression Diversity, Emotion-Content Consistency, and Expression Fluidity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel benchmark to advance research in Emo3D generation. First, we present EmoAva, a large-scale, high-quality dataset for T3DEM, comprising 15,000 text-to-3D expression mappings that characterize the aforementioned three challenges in Emo3D generation. Furthermore, we develop various metrics to effectively evaluate models against these identified challenges. Next, to effectively model the consistency, diversity, and fluidity of human expressions in the T3DEM step, we propose the Continuous Text-to-Expression Generator, which employs an autoregressive Conditional Variational Autoencoder for expression code generation, enhanced with Latent Temporal Attention and Expression-wise Attention mechanisms. Finally, to further enhance the 3DAR step on rendering higher-quality subtle expressions, we present the Globally-informed Gaussian Avatar (GiGA) model. GiGA incorporates a global information mechanism into 3D Gaussian representations, enabling the capture of subtle micro-expressions and seamless transitions between emotional states.</description>

      <title>FCL-ViT: Task-Aware Attention Tuning for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) involves adapting the prior Deep Neural Network (DNN) knowledge to new tasks, without forgetting the old ones. However, modern CL techniques focus on provisioning memory capabilities to existing DNN models rather than designing new ones that are able to adapt according to the task at hand. This paper presents the novel Feedback Continual Learning Vision Transformer (FCL-ViT) that uses a feedback mechanism to generate real-time dynamic attention features tailored to the current task. The FCL-ViT operates in two Phases. In phase 1, the generic image features are produced and determine where the Transformer should attend on the current image. In phase 2, task-specific image features are generated that leverage dynamic attention. To this end, Tunable self-Attention Blocks (TABs) and Task Specific Blocks (TSBs) are introduced that operate in both phases and are responsible for tuning the TABs attention, respectively. The FCL-ViT surpasses state-of-the-art performance on Continual Learning compared to benchmark methods, while retaining a small number of trainable DNN parameters.</description>

      <title>Bias Analysis of AI Models for Undergraduate Student Admissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias detection and mitigation is an active area of research in machine learning. This work extends previous research done by the authors to provide a rigorous and more complete analysis of the bias found in AI predictive models. Admissions data spanning six years was used to create an AI model to determine whether a given student would be directly admitted into the School of Science under various scenarios at a large urban research university. During this time, submission of standardized test scores as part of an application became optional which led to interesting questions about the impact of standardized test scores on admission decisions. We developed and analyzed AI models to understand which variables are important in admissions decisions, and how the decision to exclude test scores affects the demographics of the students who are admitted. We then evaluated the predictive models to detect and analyze biases these models may carry with respect to three variables chosen to represent sensitive populations: gender, race, and whether a student was the first in his or her family to attend college. We also extended our analysis to show that the biases detected were persistent. Finally, we included several fairness metrics in our analysis and discussed the uses and limitations of these metrics.</description>

      <title>Graph-Powered Defense: Controller Area Network Intrusion Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network of services, including delivery, farming, and environmental monitoring, has experienced exponential expansion in the past decade with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Yet, UAVs are not robust enough against cyberattacks, especially on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. The CAN bus is a general-purpose vehicle-bus standard to enable microcontrollers and in-vehicle computers to interact, primarily connecting different Electronic Control Units (ECUs). In this study, we focus on solving some of the most critical security weaknesses in UAVs by developing a novel graph-based intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging the Uncomplicated Application-level Vehicular Communication and Networking (UAVCAN) protocol. First, we decode CAN messages based on UAVCAN protocol specification; second, we present a comprehensive method of transforming tabular UAVCAN messages into graph structures. Lastly, we apply various graph-based machine learning models for detecting cyber-attacks on the CAN bus, including graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs), graph attention networks (GATs), Graph Sample and Aggregate Networks (GraphSAGE), and graph structure-based transformers. Our findings show that inductive models such as GATs, GraphSAGE, and graph-based transformers can achieve competitive and even better accuracy than transductive models like GCNNs in detecting various types of intrusions, with minimum information on protocol specification, thus providing a generic robust solution for CAN bus security for the UAVs. We also compared our results with baseline single-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and found that all our graph-based models perform better without using any decoded features based on the UAVCAN protocol, highlighting higher detection performance with protocol-independent capability.</description>

      <title>Factored space models: Towards causality between levels of abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality plays an important role in understanding intelligent behavior, and there is a wealth of literature on mathematical models for causality, most of which is focused on causal graphs. Causal graphs are a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, in particular when the relevant variables are known and at the same level of abstraction. However, the given variables can also be unstructured data, like pixels of an image. Meanwhile, the causal variables, such as the positions of objects in the image, can be arbitrary deterministic functions of the given variables. Moreover, the causal variables may form a hierarchy of abstractions, in which the macro-level variables are deterministic functions of the micro-level variables. Causal graphs are limited when it comes to modeling this kind of situation. In the presence of deterministic relationships there is generally no causal graph that satisfies both the Markov condition and the faithfulness condition. We introduce factored space models as an alternative to causal graphs which naturally represent both probabilistic and deterministic relationships at all levels of abstraction. Moreover, we introduce structural independence and establish that it is equivalent to statistical independence in every distribution that factorizes over the factored space. This theorem generalizes the classical soundness and completeness theorem for d-separation.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Resource Allocation Framework for Microservices in Hybrid Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for scalable, efficient resource management in hybrid cloud environments has led to the exploration of AI-driven approaches for dynamic resource allocation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for resource allocation among microservices in hybrid cloud platforms. The framework employs reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource utilization optimization to reduce costs and improve performance. The framework integrates AI models with cloud management tools to respond to challenges of dynamic scaling and cost-efficient low-latency service delivery. The reinforcement learning model continuously adjusts provisioned resources as required by the microservices and predicts the future consumption trends to minimize both under- and over-provisioning of resources. Preliminary simulation results indicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can reduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and threshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the efficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a corresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study compares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource allocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to outperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results indicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud platforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the power of scaling for microservice-based applications. The proposed framework is a strong and scalable solution to managing cloud resources in dynamic and performance-critical environments.</description>

      <title>Projection Abstractions in Planning Under the Lenses of Abstractions for MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of abstraction has been independently developed both in the context of AI Planning and discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, the way abstractions are built and used in the context of Planning and MDPs is different even though lots of commonalities can be highlighted. To this day there is no work trying to relate and unify the two fields on the matter of abstractions unraveling all the different assumptions and their effect on the way they can be used. Therefore, in this paper we aim to do so by looking at projection abstractions in Planning through the lenses of discounted MDPs. Starting from a projection abstraction built according to Classical or Probabilistic Planning techniques, we will show how the same abstraction can be obtained under the abstraction frameworks available for discounted MDPs. Along the way, we will focus on computational as well as representational advantages and disadvantages of both worlds pointing out new research directions that are of interest for both fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly revolutionized the field of clinical diagnosis and treatment, offering novel approaches to improve diagnostic precision and treatment efficacy across diverse clinical domains, thus driving the pursuit of precision medicine. The growing availability of multi-organ and multimodal datasets has accelerated the development of large-scale Medical Multimodal Foundation Models (MMFMs). These models, known for their strong generalization capabilities and rich representational power, are increasingly being adapted to address a wide range of clinical tasks, from early diagnosis to personalized treatment strategies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of recent developments in MMFMs, focusing on three key aspects: datasets, model architectures, and clinical applications. We also explore the challenges and opportunities in optimizing multimodal representations and discuss how these advancements are shaping the future of healthcare by enabling improved patient outcomes and more efficient clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of Attention in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key component of transformers is the attention mechanism orchestrating how each token influences the propagation of every other token through a transformer. In this paper we provide a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the asymptotic properties of attention in transformers. Although we present several results based on different assumptions, all of them point to the same conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully compared with existing theoretical results and illustrated by simulations and experimental studies using the GPT-2 model.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting it into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently constrained in real-world applications due to inevitable information loss in simple undirected graphs and data-driven model optimization dilemmas associated with exceeding the upper bounds of representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and its quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Aggregation Rules in Participatory Budgeting: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) offers a democratic process for communities to allocate public funds across various projects through voting. In practice, PB organizers face challenges in selecting aggregation rules either because they are not familiar with the literature and the exact details of every existing rule or because no existing rule echoes their expectations. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach utilizing machine learning to address this challenge. By training neural networks on PB instances, our approach learns aggregation rules that balance social welfare, representation, and other societal beneficial goals. It is able to generalize from small-scale synthetic PB examples to large, real-world PB instances. It is able to learn existing aggregation rules but also generate new rules that adapt to diverse objectives, providing a more nuanced, compromise-driven solution for PB processes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with synthetic and real-world PB data, and can expand the use and deployment of PB solutions.</description>

      <title>Composition of Experts: A Modular Compound AI System Leveraging Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, but their monolithic nature presents challenges in terms of scalability, cost, and customization. This paper introduces the Composition of Experts (CoE), a modular compound AI system leveraging multiple expert LLMs. CoE leverages a router to dynamically select the most appropriate expert for a given input, enabling efficient utilization of resources and improved performance. We formulate the general problem of training a CoE and discuss inherent complexities associated with it. We propose a two-step routing approach to address these complexities that first uses a router to classify the input into distinct categories followed by a category-to-expert mapping to obtain desired experts. CoE offers a flexible and cost-effective solution to build compound AI systems. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of CoE in achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead. Given that CoE comprises of many expert LLMs it has unique system requirements for cost-effective serving. We present an efficient implementation of CoE leveraging SambaNova SN40L RDUs unique three-tiered memory architecture. CoEs obtained using open weight LLMs Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct, google/gemma-2-9b-it, google/gemma-2-27b-it, meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct achieve a score of $59.4$ with merely $31$ billion average active parameters on Arena-Hard and a score of $9.06$ with $54$ billion average active parameters on MT-Bench.</description>

      <title>MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling effective collaboration among LLMs is a crucial step toward developing autonomous systems capable of solving complex problems. While LLMs are typically used as single-model generators, where humans critique and refine their outputs, the potential for jointly-trained collaborative models remains largely unexplored. Despite promising results in multi-agent communication and debate settings, little progress has been made in training models to work together on tasks. In this paper, we present a first step toward "Multi-agent LLM training" (MALT) on reasoning problems. Our approach employs a sequential multi-agent setup with heterogeneous LLMs assigned specialized roles: a generator, verifier, and refinement model iteratively solving problems. We propose a trajectory-expansion-based synthetic data generation process and a credit assignment strategy driven by joint outcome based rewards. This enables our post-training setup to utilize both positive and negative trajectories to autonomously improve each model's specialized capabilities as part of a joint sequential system. We evaluate our approach across MATH, GSM8k, and CQA, where MALT on Llama 3.1 8B models achieves relative improvements of 14.14%, 7.12%, and 9.40% respectively over the same baseline model. This demonstrates an early advance in multi-agent cooperative capabilities for performance on mathematical and common sense reasoning questions. More generally, our work provides a concrete direction for research around multi-agent LLM training approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning methods are highly local and sensitive to the domain of data they are trained with. Even a slight deviation from the domain distribution affects prediction accuracy of deep networks significantly. In this work, we have investigated a set of techniques aimed at increasing accuracy of generator networks which perform translation from one domain to the other in an adversarial setting. In particular, we experimented with activations, the encoder-decoder network architectures, and introduced a Loss called cyclic loss to constrain the Generator network so that it learns effective source-target translation. This machine learning problem is motivated by myriad applications that can be derived from domain adaptation networks like generating labeled data from synthetic inputs in an unsupervised fashion, and using these translation network in conjunction with the original domain network to generalize deep learning networks across domains.</description>

      <title>Kernel-Free Universum Quadratic Surface Twin Support Vector Machines for Imbalanced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary classification tasks with imbalanced classes pose significant challenges in machine learning. Traditional classifiers often struggle to accurately capture the characteristics of the minority class, resulting in biased models with subpar predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to tackle this issue by leveraging Universum points to support the minority class within quadratic twin support vector machine models. Unlike traditional classifiers, our models utilize quadratic surfaces instead of hyperplanes for binary classification, providing greater flexibility in modeling complex decision boundaries. By incorporating Universum points, our approach enhances classification accuracy and generalization performance on imbalanced datasets. We generated four artificial datasets to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methods. Additionally, we validated the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets, showing superior performance compared to conventional classifiers and existing methods for imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Identifying Key Nodes for the Influence Spread using a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of key nodes in complex networks is an important topic in many network science areas. It is vital to a variety of real-world applications, including viral marketing, epidemic spreading and influence maximization. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform the conventional, centrality-based methods in accuracy and consistency, but this approach still requires further refinement. What information about the influencers can be extracted from the network? How can we precisely obtain the labels required for training? Can these models generalize well? In this paper, we answer these questions by presenting an enhanced machine learning-based framework for the influence spread problem. We focus on identifying key nodes for the Independent Cascade model, which is a popular reference method. Our main contribution is an improved process of obtaining the labels required for training by introducing 'Smart Bins' and proving their advantage over known methods. Next, we show that our methodology allows ML models to not only predict the influence of a given node, but to also determine other characteristics of the spreading process-which is another novelty to the relevant literature. Finally, we extensively test our framework and its ability to generalize beyond complex networks of different types and sizes, gaining important insight into the properties of these methods.</description>

      <title>The use of large language models to enhance cancer clinical trial educational materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer clinical trials often face challenges in recruitment and engagement due to a lack of participant-facing informational and educational resources. This study investigated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in generating patient-friendly educational content from clinical trial informed consent forms. Using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we employed zero-shot learning for creating trial summaries and one-shot learning for developing multiple-choice questions, evaluating their effectiveness through patient surveys and crowdsourced annotation. Results showed that GPT4-generated summaries were both readable and comprehensive, and may improve patients' understanding and interest in clinical trials. The multiple-choice questions demonstrated high accuracy and agreement with crowdsourced annotators. For both resource types, hallucinations were identified that require ongoing human oversight. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs "out-of-the-box" to support the generation of clinical trial education materials with minimal trial-specific engineering, but implementation with a human-in-the-loop is still needed to avoid misinformation risks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deep Learning Model Robustness through Metamorphic Re-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the use of metamorphic relations to enhance the robustness and real-world performance of machine learning models. We propose a Metamorphic Retraining Framework, which applies metamorphic relations to data and utilizes semi-supervised learning algorithms in an iterative and adaptive multi-cycle process. The framework integrates multiple semi-supervised retraining algorithms, including FixMatch, FlexMatch, MixMatch, and FullMatch, to automate the retraining, evaluation, and testing of models with specified configurations. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST datasets using a variety of image processing models, both pretrained and non-pretrained. Our results demonstrate the potential of metamorphic retraining to significantly improve model robustness as we show in our results that each model witnessed an increase of an additional flat 17 percent on average in our robustness metric.</description>

      <title>Learning a Filtered Backprojection Reconstruction Method for Photoacoustic Computed Tomography with Hemispherical Measurement Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In certain three-dimensional (3D) applications of photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), including \textit{in vivo} breast imaging, hemispherical measurement apertures that enclose the object within their convex hull are employed for data acquisition. Data acquired with such measurement geometries are referred to as \textit{half-scan} data, as only half of a complete spherical measurement aperture is employed. Although previous studies have demonstrated that half-scan data can uniquely and stably reconstruct the sought-after object, no closed-form reconstruction formula for use with half-scan data has been reported. To address this, a semi-analytic reconstruction method in the form of filtered backprojection (FBP), referred to as the half-scan FBP method, is developed in this work. Because the explicit form of the filtering operation in the half-scan FBP method is not currently known, a learning-based method is proposed to approximate it. The proposed method is systematically investigated by use of virtual imaging studies of 3D breast PACT that employ ensembles of numerical breast phantoms and a physics-based model of the data acquisition process. The method is subsequently applied to experimental data acquired in an \textit{in vivo} breast PACT study. The results confirm that the half-scan FBP method can accurately reconstruct 3D images from half-scan data. Importantly, because the sought-after inverse mapping is well-posed, the reconstruction method remains accurate even when applied to data that differ considerably from those employed to learn the filtering operation.</description>

      <title>Human-centred test and evaluation of military AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The REAIM 2024 Blueprint for Action states that AI applications in the military domain should be ethical and human-centric and that humans must remain responsible and accountable for their use and effects. Developing rigorous test and evaluation, verification and validation (TEVV) frameworks will contribute to robust oversight mechanisms. TEVV in the development and deployment of AI systems needs to involve human users throughout the lifecycle. Traditional human-centred test and evaluation methods from human factors need to be adapted for deployed AI systems that require ongoing monitoring and evaluation. The language around AI-enabled systems should be shifted to inclusion of the human(s) as a component of the system. Standards and requirements supporting this adjusted definition are needed, as are metrics and means to evaluate them. The need for dialogue between technologists and policymakers on human-centred TEVV will be evergreen, but dialogue needs to be initiated with an objective in mind for it to be productive. Development of TEVV throughout system lifecycle is critical to support this evolution including the issue of human scalability and impact on scale of achievable testing. Communication between technical and non technical communities must be improved to ensure operators and policy-makers understand risk assumed by system use and to better inform research and development. Test and evaluation in support of responsible AI deployment must include the effect of the human to reflect operationally realised system performance. Means of communicating the results of TEVV to those using and making decisions regarding the use of AI based systems will be key in informing risk based decisions regarding use.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Multilingual Sign Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Processing (SLP) is an interdisciplinary field comprised of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. It is focused on the computational understanding, translation, and production of signed languages. Traditional approaches have often been constrained by the use of gloss-based systems that are both language-specific and inadequate for capturing the multidimensional nature of sign language. These limitations have hindered the development of technology capable of processing signed languages effectively.
  This thesis aims to revolutionize the field of SLP by proposing a simple paradigm that can bridge this existing technological gap. We propose the use of SignWiring, a universal sign language transcription notation system, to serve as an intermediary link between the visual-gestural modality of signed languages and text-based linguistic representations.
  We contribute foundational libraries and resources to the SLP community, thereby setting the stage for a more in-depth exploration of the tasks of sign language translation and production. These tasks encompass the translation of sign language from video to spoken language text and vice versa. Through empirical evaluations, we establish the efficacy of our transcription method as a pivot for enabling faster, more targeted research, that can lead to more natural and accurate translations across a range of languages.
  The universal nature of our transcription-based paradigm also paves the way for real-time, multilingual applications in SLP, thereby offering a more inclusive and accessible approach to language technology. This is a significant step toward universal accessibility, enabling a wider reach of AI-driven language technologies to include the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.</description>

      <title>ChatCollab: Exploring Collaboration Between Humans and AI Agents in Software Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential for productive team-based collaboration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) by presenting and conducting initial tests with a general framework that enables multiple human and AI agents to work together as peers. ChatCollab's novel architecture allows agents - human or AI - to join collaborations in any role, autonomously engage in tasks and communication within Slack, and remain agnostic to whether their collaborators are human or AI. Using software engineering as a case study, we find that our AI agents successfully identify their roles and responsibilities, coordinate with other agents, and await requested inputs or deliverables before proceeding. In relation to three prior multi-agent AI systems for software development, we find ChatCollab AI agents produce comparable or better software in an interactive game development task. We also propose an automated method for analyzing collaboration dynamics that effectively identifies behavioral characteristics of agents with distinct roles, allowing us to quantitatively compare collaboration dynamics in a range of experimental conditions. For example, in comparing ChatCollab AI agents, we find that an AI CEO agent generally provides suggestions 2-4 times more often than an AI product manager or AI developer, suggesting agents within ChatCollab can meaningfully adopt differentiated collaborative roles.

      <title>Who's Gaming the System? A Causally-Motivated Approach for Detecting Strategic Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many settings, machine learning models may be used to inform decisions that impact individuals or entities who interact with the model. Such entities, or agents, may game model decisions by manipulating their inputs to the model to obtain better outcomes and maximize some utility. We consider a multi-agent setting where the goal is to identify the "worst offenders:" agents that are gaming most aggressively. However, identifying such agents is difficult without knowledge of their utility function. Thus, we introduce a framework in which each agent's tendency to game is parameterized via a scalar. We show that this gaming parameter is only partially identifiable. By recasting the problem as a causal effect estimation problem where different agents represent different "treatments," we prove that a ranking of all agents by their gaming parameters is identifiable. We present empirical results in a synthetic data study validating the usage of causal effect estimation for gaming detection and show in a case study of diagnosis coding behavior in the U.S. that our approach highlights features associated with gaming.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Explainable Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their large sizes, volumetric scans and whole-slide pathology images (WSIs) are often processed by extracting embeddings from local regions and then an aggregator makes predictions from this set. However, current methods require post-hoc visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) and often fail to localize small yet clinically crucial details. To address these limitations, we introduce INSIGHT, a novel weakly-supervised aggregator that integrates heatmap generation as an inductive bias. Starting from pre-trained feature maps, INSIGHT employs a detection module with small convolutional kernels to capture fine details and a context module with a broader receptive field to suppress local false positives. The resulting internal heatmap highlights diagnostically relevant regions. On CT and WSI benchmarks, INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art classification results and high weakly-labeled semantic segmentation performance.

      <title>Explore Reinforced: Equilibrium Approximation with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current approximate Coarse Correlated Equilibria (CCE) algorithms struggle with equilibrium approximation for games in large stochastic environments but are theoretically guaranteed to converge to a strong solution concept. In contrast, modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms provide faster training yet yield weaker solutions. We introduce Exp3-IXrl - a blend of RL and game-theoretic approach, separating the RL agent's action selection from the equilibrium computation while preserving the integrity of the learning process. We demonstrate that our algorithm expands the application of equilibrium approximation algorithms to new environments. Specifically, we show the improved performance in a complex and adversarial cybersecurity network environment - the Cyber Operations Research Gym - and in the classical multi-armed bandit settings.</description>

      <title>PKRD-CoT: A Unified Chain-of-thought Prompting for Multi-Modal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging the capabilities of robust Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) directly within autonomous driving contexts. However, the high costs and complexity of designing and training end-to-end autonomous driving models make them challenging for many enterprises and research entities. To address this, our study explores a seamless integration of MLLMs into autonomous driving systems by proposing a Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (Zero-Shot-CoT) prompt design named PKRD-CoT. PKRD-CoT is based on the four fundamental capabilities of autonomous driving: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and decision-making. This makes it particularly suitable for understanding and responding to dynamic driving environments by mimicking human thought processes step by step, thus enhancing decision-making in real-time scenarios. Our design enables MLLMs to tackle problems without prior experience, thereby increasing their utility within unstructured autonomous driving environments. In experiments, we demonstrate the exceptional performance of GPT-4.0 with PKRD-CoT across autonomous driving tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. Additionally, our benchmark analysis reveals the promising viability of PKRD-CoT for other MLLMs, such as Claude, LLava1.6, and Qwen-VL-Plus. Overall, this study contributes a novel and unified prompt-design framework for GPT-4.0 and other MLLMs in autonomous driving, while also rigorously evaluating the efficacy of these widely recognized MLLMs in the autonomous driving domain through comprehensive comparisons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety filters in control systems correct nominal controls that violate safety constraints. Designing such filters as functions of visual observations in uncertain and complex environments is challenging. Several deep learning-based approaches to tackle this challenge have been proposed recently. However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones. We experiment with diverse pre-trained vision representation models as filter backbones, training approaches, and output aggregation techniques. We compare the performance of ensembles with different configurations against each other, their individual member models, and large single-model baselines in distinguishing between safe and unsafe states and controls in the DeepAccident dataset. Our results show that diverse ensembles have better state and control classification accuracies compared to individual models.</description>

Abstract: Large Foundation Models like Dust3r can produce high quality outputs such as pointmaps, camera intrinsics, and depth estimation, given stereo-image pairs as input. However, the application of these outputs on tasks like Visual Localization requires a large amount of inference time and compute resources. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose the use of a knowledge distillation pipeline, where we aim to build a student-teacher model with Dust3r as the teacher and explore multiple architectures of student models that are trained using the 3D reconstructed points output by Dust3r. Our goal is to build student models that can learn scene-specific representations and output 3D points with replicable performance such as Dust3r. The data set we used to train our models is 12Scenes. We test two main architectures of models: a CNN-based architecture and a Vision Transformer based architecture. For each architecture, we also compare the use of pre-trained models against models built from scratch. We qualitatively compare the reconstructed 3D points output by the student model against Dust3r's and discuss the various features learned by the student model. We also perform ablation studies on the models through hyperparameter tuning. Overall, we observe that the Vision Transformer presents the best performance visually and quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of information retrieval (IR), the integration of generative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) is transforming how users search for and interact with information. Recognizing this paradigm shift at the intersection of IR and generative AI (IR-GenAI), a visioning workshop supported by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) was held in July 2024 to discuss the future of IR in the age of generative AI. This workshop convened 44 experts in information retrieval, natural language processing, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence from academia, industry, and government to explore how generative AI can enhance IR and vice versa, and to identify the major challenges and opportunities in this rapidly advancing field.
  This report contains a summary of discussions as potentially important research topics and contains a list of recommendations for academics, industry practitioners, institutions, evaluation campaigns, and funding agencies.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Policies for Crop Planning Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>Implementing An Artificial Quantum Perceptron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Perceptron is a fundamental building block of a neural network. The flexibility and scalability of perceptron make it ubiquitous in building intelligent systems. Studies have shown the efficacy of a single neuron in making intelligent decisions. Here, we examined and compared two perceptrons with distinct mechanisms, and developed a quantum version of one of those perceptrons. As a part of this modeling, we implemented the quantum circuit for an artificial perception, generated a dataset, and simulated the training. Through these experiments, we show that there is an exponential growth advantage and test different qubit versions. Our findings show that this quantum model of an individual perceptron can be used as a pattern classifier. For the second type of model, we provide an understanding to design and simulate a spike-dependent quantum perceptron.

Abstract: Background: Explainability in phishing detection model can support a further solution of phishing attack mitigation by increasing trust and understanding how phishing can be detected. Objective: The aims of this study to determine and best recommendation to apply an approach which has several components with abilities to fulfil the critical needs Methods: A methodology starting with analyzing both black-box and white-box models to get the pros and cons specifically in phishing detection. The conclusion of the analysis will be validated by experiment using a set of well-known algorithms and public phishing datasets. Experimental metrics covers 3 measurements such as predictive accuracy and explainability metrics. Conclusion: Both models are comparable in terms of interpretability and consistency, with room for improvement in diverse datasets. EBM as an example of white-box model is generally better suited for applications requiring explainability and actionable insights. Finally, each model, white-box and black-box model has positive and negative aspects both for performance metric and for explainable metric. It is important to consider the objective of model usage.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Collective AI Beyond Individual Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates collective behaviors that emerge from a group of homogeneous individuals optimized for a specific capability. We created a group of simple, identical neural network based agents modeled after chemotaxis-driven vehicles that follow pheromone trails and examined multi-agent simulations using clones of these evolved individuals. Our results show that the evolution of individuals led to population differentiation. Surprisingly, we observed that collective fitness significantly changed during later evolutionary stages, despite maintained high individual performance and simplified neural architectures. This decline occurred when agents developed reduced sensor-motor coupling, suggesting that over-optimization of individual agents almost always lead to less effective group behavior. Our research investigates how individual differentiation can evolve through what evolutionary pathways.</description>

      <title>AccDiffusion v2: Towards More Accurate Higher-Resolution Diffusion Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models suffer severe object repetition and local distortion when the inference resolution differs from its pre-trained resolution. We propose AccDiffusion v2, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation without training. Our in-depth analysis in this paper shows that using an identical text prompt for different patches leads to repetitive generation, while the absence of a prompt undermines image details. In response, our AccDiffusion v2 novelly decouples the vanilla image-content-aware prompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a more precise description of a patch. Further analysis reveals that local distortion arises from inaccurate descriptions in prompts about the local structure of higher-resolution images. To address this issue, AccDiffusion v2, for the first time, introduces an auxiliary local structural information through ControlNet during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation aiming to mitigate the local distortions. Finally, our analysis indicates that global semantic information is conducive to suppressing both repetitive generation and local distortion. Hence, our AccDiffusion v2 further proposes dilated sampling with window interaction for better global semantic information during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation. We conduct extensive experiments, including both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, to demonstrate the efficacy of our AccDiffusion v2. The quantitative comparison shows that AccDiffusion v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation extrapolation without training. The qualitative comparison intuitively illustrates that AccDiffusion v2 effectively suppresses the issues of repetitive generation and local distortion in image generation extrapolation.

      <title>OmniCreator: Self-Supervised Unified Generation with Universal Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce OmniCreator, a novel framework that can conduct text-prompted unified (image+video) generation as well as editing all in one place. OmniCreator acquires generative and universal editing capabilities in a self-supervised manner, taking original text-video pairs as conditions while utilizing the same video as a denoising target to learn the semantic correspondence between video and text. During inference, when presented with a text prompt and a video, OmniCreator is capable of generating a target that is faithful to both, achieving a universal editing effect that is unconstrained as opposed to existing editing work that primarily focuses on certain editing types or relies on additional controls (e.g., structural conditions, attention features, or DDIM inversion). On the other hand, when presented with a text prompt only, OmniCreator becomes generative, producing high-quality video as a result of the semantic correspondence learned. Importantly, we found that the same capabilities extend to images as is, making OmniCreator a truly unified framework. Further, due to the lack of existing generative video editing benchmarks, we introduce the OmniBench-99 dataset, designed to evaluate the performance of generative video editing models comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniCreator exhibits substantial superiority over all other models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking symbolic regression constant optimization schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique, and it has seen many advancements in recent years, especially in genetic programming approaches (GPSR). Furthermore, it has been known for many years that constant optimization of parameters, during the evolutionary search, greatly increases GPSR performance However, different authors approach such tasks differently and no consensus exists regarding which methods perform best. In this work, we evaluate eight different parameter optimization methods, applied during evolutionary search, over ten known benchmark problems, in two different scenarios. We also propose using an under-explored metric called Tree Edit Distance (TED), aiming to identify symbolic accuracy. In conjunction with classical error measures, we develop a combined analysis of model performance in symbolic regression. We then show that different constant optimization methods perform better in certain scenarios and that there is no overall best choice for every problem. Finally, we discuss how common metric decisions may be biased and appear to generate better models in comparison.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become increasingly important due to their state-of-the-art performance and ability to integrate multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to perform complex tasks with high accuracy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on personalized multimodal large language models, focusing on their architecture, training methods, and applications. We propose an intuitive taxonomy for categorizing the techniques used to personalize MLLMs to individual users, and discuss the techniques accordingly. Furthermore, we discuss how such techniques can be combined or adapted when appropriate, highlighting their advantages and underlying rationale. We also provide a succinct summary of personalization tasks investigated in existing research, along with the evaluation metrics commonly used. Additionally, we summarize the datasets that are useful for benchmarking personalized MLLMs. Finally, we outline critical open challenges. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and advance the development of personalized multimodal large language models.</description>

      <title>Effective Mitigations for Systemic Risks from General-Purpose AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systemic risks posed by general-purpose AI models are a growing concern, yet the effectiveness of mitigations remains underexplored. Previous research has proposed frameworks for risk mitigation, but has left gaps in our understanding of the perceived effectiveness of measures for mitigating systemic risks. Our study addresses this gap by evaluating how experts perceive different mitigations that aim to reduce the systemic risks of general-purpose AI models. We surveyed 76 experts whose expertise spans AI safety; critical infrastructure; democratic processes; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks (CBRN); and discrimination and bias. Among 27 mitigations identified through a literature review, we find that a broad range of risk mitigation measures are perceived as effective in reducing various systemic risks and technically feasible by domain experts. In particular, three mitigation measures stand out: safety incident reports and security information sharing, third-party pre-deployment model audits, and pre-deployment risk assessments. These measures show both the highest expert agreement ratings (&gt;60\%) across all four risk areas and are most frequently selected in experts' preferred combinations of measures (&gt;40\%). The surveyed experts highlighted that external scrutiny, proactive evaluation and transparency are key principles for effective mitigation of systemic risks. We provide policy recommendations for implementing the most promising measures, incorporating the qualitative contributions from experts. These insights should inform regulatory frameworks and industry practices for mitigating the systemic risks associated with general-purpose AI.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Initial Steps in Adaptive Gradient Descent Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient optimization methods, such as Adam, are prevalent in training deep neural networks across diverse machine learning tasks due to their ability to achieve faster convergence. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal generalization compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and exhibit instability, particularly when training Transformer models. In this work, we show the standard initialization of the second-order moment estimation ($v_0 =0$) as a significant factor contributing to these limitations. We introduce simple yet effective solutions: initializing the second-order moment estimation with non-zero values, using either data-driven or random initialization strategies. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach not only stabilizes convergence but also enhances the final performance of adaptive gradient optimizers. Furthermore, by adopting the proposed initialization strategies, Adam achieves performance comparable to many recently proposed variants of adaptive gradient optimization methods, highlighting the practical impact of this straightforward modification.</description>

      <title>Failure Probability Estimation for Black-Box Autonomous Systems using State-Dependent Importance Sampling Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the probability of failure is a critical step in developing safety-critical autonomous systems. Direct estimation methods such as Monte Carlo sampling are often impractical due to the rarity of failures in these systems. Existing importance sampling approaches do not scale to sequential decision-making systems with large state spaces and long horizons. We propose an adaptive importance sampling algorithm to address these limitations. Our method minimizes the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence between a state-dependent proposal distribution and a relaxed form of the optimal importance sampling distribution. Our method uses Markov score ascent methods to estimate this objective. We evaluate our approach on four sequential systems and show that it provides more accurate failure probability estimates than baseline Monte Carlo and importance sampling techniques. This work is open sourced.</description>

      <title>CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human Intentions toward Public Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called \textbf{CausalMob}, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Defense in a Narrow Domain: Limitations of Existing Methods and a New Transcript-Classifier Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defending large language models against jailbreaks so that they never engage in a broadly-defined set of forbidden behaviors is an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the difficulty of jailbreak-defense when we only want to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors. As a case study, we focus on preventing an LLM from helping a user make a bomb. We find that popular defenses such as safety training, adversarial training, and input/output classifiers are unable to fully solve this problem. In pursuit of a better solution, we develop a transcript-classifier defense which outperforms the baseline defenses we test. However, our classifier defense still fails in some circumstances, which highlights the difficulty of jailbreak-defense even in a narrow domain.</description>

      <title>VISCO: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Critique and Correction Towards Self-Improvement in Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to critique and correct their reasoning is an essential building block towards their self-improvement. However, a systematic analysis of such capabilities in LVLMs is still lacking. We propose VISCO, the first benchmark to extensively analyze the fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs. Compared to existing work that uses a single scalar value to critique the entire reasoning [4], VISCO features dense and fine-grained critique, requiring LVLMs to evaluate the correctness of each step in the chain-of-thought and provide natural language explanations to support their judgments. Extensive evaluation of 24 LVLMs demonstrates that human-written critiques significantly enhance the performance after correction, showcasing the potential of the self-improvement strategy. However, the model-generated critiques are less helpful and sometimes detrimental to the performance, suggesting that critique is the crucial bottleneck. We identified three common patterns in critique failures: failure to critique visual perception, reluctance to "say no", and exaggerated assumption of error propagation. To address these issues, we propose an effective LookBack strategy that revisits the image to verify each piece of information in the initial reasoning. LookBack significantly improves critique and correction performance by up to 13.5%.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning-Based Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance Using PPO and B-Splines in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SmartBSP, an advanced self-supervised learning framework for real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in autonomous robotics navigating through complex environments. The proposed system integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Actor-Critic architecture to process limited LIDAR inputs and compute spatial decision-making probabilities. The robot's perceptual field is discretized into a grid format, which the CNN analyzes to produce a spatial probability distribution. During the training process a nuanced cost function is minimized that accounts for path curvature, endpoint proximity, and obstacle avoidance. Simulations results in different scenarios validate the algorithm's resilience and adaptability across diverse operational scenarios. Subsequently, Real-time experiments, employing the Robot Operating System (ROS), were carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision-language models, realistic radiology reports may be generated using only medical images as input guided by simple prompts. However, their practical utility has been limited due to the factual errors in their description of findings. In this paper, we propose a novel model for explainable fact-checking that identifies errors in findings and their locations indicated through the reports. Specifically, we analyze the types of errors made by automated reporting methods and derive a new synthetic dataset of images paired with real and fake descriptions of findings and their locations from a ground truth dataset. A new multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this datsaset. We evaluate the resulting fact-checking model and its utility in correcting reports generated by several SOTA automated reporting tools on a variety of benchmark datasets with results pointing to over 40\% improvement in report quality through such error detection and correction.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels to Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>VideoICL: Confidence-based Iterative In-context Learning for Out-of-Distribution Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in video large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly improved their video understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, their performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that are underrepresented in training data. Traditional methods like fine-tuning on OOD datasets are impractical due to high computational costs. While In-context learning (ICL) with demonstration examples has shown promising generalization performance in language tasks and image-language tasks without fine-tuning, applying ICL to video-language tasks faces challenges due to the limited context length in Video LMMs, as videos require longer token lengths. To address these issues, we propose VideoICL, a novel video in-context learning framework for OOD tasks that introduces a similarity-based relevant example selection strategy and a confidence-based iterative inference approach. This allows to select the most relevant examples and rank them based on similarity, to be used for inference. If the generated response has low confidence, our framework selects new examples and performs inference again, iteratively refining the results until a high-confidence response is obtained. This approach improves OOD video understanding performance by extending effective context length without incurring high costs. The experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains, especially in domain-specific scenarios, laying the groundwork for broader video comprehension applications.

      <title>LayoutVLM: Differentiable Optimization of 3D Layout via Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-universe 3D layout generation arranges unlabeled 3D assets conditioned on language instruction. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with generating physically plausible 3D scenes and adherence to input instructions, particularly in cluttered scenes. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve performance.</description>

      <title>DataLab: A Unifed Platform for LLM-Powered Business Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports a wide range of BI tasks for different data roles by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.</description>

      <title>Recovering implicit physics model under real-world constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering a physics-driven model, i.e. a governing set of equations of the underlying dynamical systems, from the real-world data has been of recent interest. Most existing methods either operate on simulation data with unrealistically high sampling rates or require explicit measurements of all system variables, which is not amenable in real-world deployments. Moreover, they assume the timestamps of external perturbations to the physical system are known a priori, without uncertainty, implicitly discounting any sensor time-synchronization or human reporting errors. In this paper, we propose a novel liquid time constant neural network (LTC-NN) based architecture to recover underlying model of physical dynamics from real-world data. The automatic differentiation property of LTC-NN nodes overcomes problems associated with low sampling rates, the input dependent time constant in the forward pass of the hidden layer of LTC-NN nodes creates a massive search space of implicit physical dynamics, the physics model solver based data reconstruction loss guides the search for the correct set of implicit dynamics, and the use of the dropout regularization in the dense layer ensures extraction of the sparsest model. Further, to account for the perturbation timing error, we utilize dense layer nodes to search through input shifts that results in the lowest reconstruction loss. Experiments on four benchmark dynamical systems, three with simulation data and one with the real-world data show that the LTC-NN architecture is more accurate in recovering implicit physics model coefficients than the state-of-the-art sparse model recovery approaches. We also introduce four additional case studies (total eight) on real-life medical examples in simulation and with real-world clinical data to show effectiveness of our approach in recovering underlying model in practice.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Tuning-Free Few-Shot Adaptability in Visual Foundation Models by Recycling Pre-Tuned LoRAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrate strong few-shot adaptability without requiring fine-tuning, positioning them ideal for data-limited and real-time applications. However, this adaptability has not yet been replicated in current Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which require explicit fine-tuning with sufficient tuning data. Besides, the pretraining-finetuning paradigm has led to the surge of numerous task-specific modular components, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). For the first time, we explore the potential of reusing diverse pre-tuned LoRAs without accessing their original training data, to achieve tuning-free few-shot adaptation in VFMs. Our framework, LoRA Recycle, distills a meta-LoRA from diverse pre-tuned LoRAs with a meta-learning objective, using surrogate data generated inversely from pre-tuned LoRAs themselves. The VFM, once equipped with the meta-LoRA, is empowered to solve new few-shot tasks in a single forward pass, akin to the in-context learning of LLMs. Additionally, we incorporate a double-efficient mechanism tailored to our framework, significantly accelerating the meta-training process while maintaining or even improving performance. Extensive experiments across various few-shot classification benchmarks across both in- and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our framework.</description>

      <title>BANER: Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), challenges such as over/under-detected false spans in the span detection stage and unaligned entity prototypes in the type classification stage persist. Additionally, LLMs have not proven to be effective few-shot information extractors in general. In this paper, we propose an approach called Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition to address these issues. We introduce a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLM's ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, we utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods, validating its effectiveness. In particular, the proposed strategies demonstrate effectiveness across a range of LLM architectures. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/BANER.</description>

      <title>Cross-Attention Head Position Patterns Can Align with Human Visual Concepts in Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models leverage cross-attention layers, which have been effectively utilized to enhance a range of visual generative tasks. However, our understanding of cross-attention layers remains somewhat limited. In this study, we present a method for constructing Head Relevance Vectors (HRVs) that align with useful visual concepts. An HRV for a given visual concept is a vector with a length equal to the total number of cross-attention heads, where each element represents the importance of the corresponding head for the given visual concept. We develop and employ an ordered weakening analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of HRVs as interpretable features. To demonstrate the utility of HRVs, we propose concept strengthening and concept adjusting methods and apply them to enhance three visual generative tasks. We show that misinterpretations of polysemous words in image generation can be corrected in most cases, five challenging attributes in image editing can be successfully modified, and catastrophic neglect in multi-concept generation can be mitigated. Overall, our work provides an advancement in understanding cross-attention layers and introduces new approaches for fine-controlling these layers at the head level.</description>

      <title>U-Net in Medical Image Segmentation: A Review of Its Applications Across Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical imaging is essential in healthcare to provide key insights into patient anatomy and pathology, aiding in diagnosis and treatment. Non-invasive techniques such as X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and Ultrasound (US), capture detailed images of organs, tissues, and abnormalities. Effective analysis of these images requires precise segmentation to delineate regions of interest (ROI), such as organs or lesions. Traditional segmentation methods, relying on manual feature-extraction, are labor-intensive and vary across experts. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), particularly convolutional models such as U-Net and its variants (U-Net++ and U-Net 3+), have transformed medical image segmentation (MIS) by automating the process and enhancing accuracy. These models enable efficient, precise pixel-wise classification across various imaging modalities, overcoming the limitations of manual segmentation. This review explores various medical imaging techniques, examines the U-Net architectures and their adaptations, and discusses their application across different modalities. It also identifies common challenges in MIS and proposes potential solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a widely researched area in artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching agents decision-making through interactions with their environment. A key subset includes stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) and continuum-armed bandit (SCAB) problems, which model sequential decision-making under uncertainty. This review outlines the foundational models and assumptions of bandit problems, explores non-asymptotic theoretical tools like concentration inequalities and minimax regret bounds, and compares frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for managing exploration-exploitation trade-offs. We also extend the discussion to $K$-armed contextual bandits and SCAB, examining their methodologies, regret analyses, and discussing the relation between the SCAB problems and the functional data analysis. Finally, we highlight recent advances and ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>VideoGen-of-Thought: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Shot Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current video generation models excel at generating short clips but still struggle with creating multi-shot, movie-like videos. Existing models trained on large-scale data on the back of rich computational resources are unsurprisingly inadequate for maintaining a logical storyline and visual consistency across multiple shots of a cohesive script since they are often trained with a single-shot objective. To this end, we propose VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a collaborative and training-free architecture designed specifically for multi-shot video generation. VGoT is designed with three goals in mind as follows. Multi-Shot Video Generation: We divide the video generation process into a structured, modular sequence, including (1) Script Generation, which translates a curt story into detailed prompts for each shot; (2) Keyframe Generation, responsible for creating visually consistent keyframes faithful to character portrayals; and (3) Shot-Level Video Generation, which transforms information from scripts and keyframes into shots; (4) Smoothing Mechanism that ensures a consistent multi-shot output. Reasonable Narrative Design: Inspired by cinematic scriptwriting, our prompt generation approach spans five key domains, ensuring logical consistency, character development, and narrative flow across the entire video. Cross-Shot Consistency: We ensure temporal and identity consistency by leveraging identity-preserving (IP) embeddings across shots, which are automatically created from the narrative. Additionally, we incorporate a cross-shot smoothing mechanism, which integrates a reset boundary that effectively combines latent features from adjacent shots, resulting in smooth transitions and maintaining visual coherence throughout the video. Our experiments demonstrate that VGoT surpasses existing video generation methods in producing high-quality, coherent, multi-shot videos.</description>

      <title>Connecting Large Language Models with Blockchain: Advancing the Evolution of Smart Contracts from Automation to Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain smart contracts have catalyzed the development of decentralized applications across various domains, including decentralized finance. However, due to constraints in computational resources and the prevalence of data silos, current smart contracts face significant challenges in fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks such as intelligent analysis and reasoning. To address this gap, this paper proposes and implements a universal framework for integrating LLMs with blockchain data, {\sysname}, effectively overcoming the interoperability barriers between blockchain and LLMs. By combining semantic relatedness with truth discovery methods, we introduce an innovative data aggregation approach, {\funcname}, which significantly enhances the accuracy and trustworthiness of data generated by LLMs. To validate the framework's effectiveness, we construct a dataset consisting of three types of questions, capturing Q\&amp;A interactions between 10 oracle nodes and 5 LLM models. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with 40\% malicious nodes, the proposed solution improves data accuracy by an average of 17.74\% compared to the optimal baseline. This research not only provides an innovative solution for the intelligent enhancement of smart contracts but also highlights the potential for deep integration between LLMs and blockchain technology, paving the way for more intelligent and complex applications of smart contracts in the future.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Self-evolution Adversarial Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the wide application of deep neural network models in various computer vision tasks, there has been a proliferation of adversarial example generation strategies aimed at deeply exploring model security. However, existing adversarial training defense models, which rely on single or limited types of attacks under a one-time learning process, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of attack methods. Therefore, to achieve defense performance improvements for models in long-term applications, we propose a novel Sustainable Self-Evolution Adversarial Training (SSEAT) framework. Specifically, we introduce a continual adversarial defense pipeline to realize learning from various kinds of adversarial examples across multiple stages. Additionally, to address the issue of model catastrophic forgetting caused by continual learning from ongoing novel attacks, we propose an adversarial data replay module to better select more diverse and key relearning data. Furthermore, we design a consistency regularization strategy to encourage current defense models to learn more from previously trained ones, guiding them to retain more past knowledge and maintain accuracy on clean samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed SSEAT defense method, which demonstrates superior defense performance and classification accuracy compared to competitors.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of natural language processing, revolutionizing numerous downstream tasks with powerful reasoning and generation abilities. For example, In-Context Learning (ICL) introduces a fine-tuning-free paradigm, allowing out-of-the-box LLMs to execute downstream tasks by analogy learning without any fine-tuning. Besides, in a fine-tuning-dependent paradigm where substantial training data exists, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), as the cost-effective methods, enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance comparable to full fine-tuning.
  However, these fascinating techniques employed by LLMs have not been fully exploited in the ABSA field. Previous works probe LLMs in ABSA by merely using randomly selected input-output pairs as demonstrations in ICL, resulting in an incomplete and superficial evaluation. In this paper, we shed light on a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the ABSA field, involving 13 datasets, 8 ABSA subtasks, and 6 LLMs. Specifically, we design a unified task formulation to unify ``multiple LLMs for multiple ABSA subtasks in multiple paradigms.'' For the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm, we efficiently fine-tune LLMs using instruction-based multi-task learning. For the fine-tuning-free paradigm, we propose 3 demonstration selection strategies to stimulate the few-shot abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art performance compared to fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) in the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm. More importantly, in the fine-tuning-free paradigm where SLMs are ineffective, LLMs with ICL still showcase impressive potential and even compete with fine-tuned SLMs on some ABSA subtasks.</description>

Abstract: Emotion recognition is significantly enhanced by integrating multimodal biosignals and IMU data from multiple domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-scale attention-based LSTM architecture, combined with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, by leveraging multi-domain signals from the head (Meta Quest Pro VR headset), trunk (Equivital Vest), and peripheral (Empatica Embrace Plus) during affect elicitation via visual stimuli. Signals from 23 participants were recorded, alongside self-assessed valence and arousal ratings after each stimulus. LSTM layers extract features from each modality, while multi-scale attention captures fine-grained temporal dependencies, and SE blocks recalibrate feature importance prior to classification. We assess which domain's signals carry the most distinctive emotional information during VR experiences, identifying key biosignals contributing to emotion detection. The proposed architecture, validated in a user study, demonstrates superior performance in classifying valance and arousal level (high / low), showcasing the efficacy of multi-domain and multi-modal fusion with biosignals (e.g., TEMP, EDA) with IMU data (e.g., accelerometer) for emotion recognition in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>GQWformer: A Quantum-based Transformer for Graph Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated significant advantages in graph representation learning through their global attention mechanisms. However, the self-attention mechanism in GTs tends to neglect the inductive biases inherent in graph structures, making it chanllenging to effectively capture essential structural information. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that integrate graph inductive bias into self-attention mechanisms by leveraging quantum technology for structural encoding. In this paper, we introduce the Graph Quantum Walk Transformer (GQWformer), a groundbreaking GNN framework that utilizes quantum walks on attributed graphs to generate node quantum states. These quantum states encapsulate rich structural attributes and serve as inductive biases for the transformer, thereby enabling the generation of more meaningful attention scores. By subsequently incorporating a recurrent neural network, our design amplifies the model's ability to focus on both local and global information. We conducted comprehensive experiments across five publicly available datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. These results clearly indicate that GQWformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art graph classification algorithms. These findings highlight the significant potential of integrating quantum computing methodologies with traditional GNNs to advance the field of graph representation learning, providing a promising direction for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Conformal Symplectic Optimization for Stable Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents necessitates overcoming the highly unstable nonconvex stochastic optimization inherent in the trial-and-error mechanism. To tackle this challenge, we propose a physics-inspired optimization algorithm called relativistic adaptive gradient descent (RAD), which enhances long-term training stability. By conceptualizing neural network (NN) training as the evolution of a conformal Hamiltonian system, we present a universal framework for transferring long-term stability from conformal symplectic integrators to iterative NN updating rules, where the choice of kinetic energy governs the dynamical properties of resulting optimization algorithms. By utilizing relativistic kinetic energy, RAD incorporates principles from special relativity and limits parameter updates below a finite speed, effectively mitigating abnormal gradient influences. Additionally, RAD models NN optimization as the evolution of a multi-particle system where each trainable parameter acts as an independent particle with an individual adaptive learning rate. We prove RAD's sublinear convergence under general nonconvex settings, where smaller gradient variance and larger batch sizes contribute to tighter convergence. Notably, RAD degrades to the well-known adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm when its speed coefficient is chosen as one and symplectic factor as a small positive value. Experimental results show RAD outperforming nine baseline optimizers with five RL algorithms across twelve environments, including standard benchmarks and challenging scenarios. Notably, RAD achieves up to a 155.1% performance improvement over ADAM in Atari games, showcasing its efficacy in stabilizing and accelerating RL training.</description>

      <title>Deep Matrix Factorization with Adaptive Weights for Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep matrix factorization has been established as a powerful model for unsupervised tasks, achieving promising results, especially for multi-view clustering. However, existing methods often lack effective feature selection mechanisms and rely on empirical hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Deep Matrix Factorization with Adaptive Weights for Multi-View Clustering (DMFAW). Our method simultaneously incorporates feature selection and generates local partitions, enhancing clustering results. Notably, the features weights are controlled and adjusted by a parameter that is dynamically updated using Control Theory inspired mechanism, which not only improves the model's stability and adaptability to diverse datasets but also accelerates convergence. A late fusion approach is then proposed to align the weighted local partitions with the consensus partition. Finally, the optimization problem is solved via an alternating optimization algorithm with theoretically guaranteed convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets highlight that DMFAW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance.</description>

      <title>Initial Study On Improving Segmentation By Combining Preoperative CT And Intraoperative CBCT Using Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-Assisted Interventions enable clinicians to perform precise, minimally invasive procedures, often relying on advanced imaging methods. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can be used to facilitate computer-assisted interventions, despite often suffering from artifacts that pose challenges for accurate interpretation. While the degraded image quality can affect image analysis, the availability of high quality, preoperative scans offers potential for improvements. Here we consider a setting where preoperative CT and intraoperative CBCT scans are available, however, the alignment (registration) between the scans is imperfect to simulate a real world scenario. We propose a multimodal learning method that fuses roughly aligned CBCT and CT scans and investigate the effect on segmentation performance. For this experiment we use synthetically generated data containing real CT and synthetic CBCT volumes with corresponding voxel annotations. We show that this fusion setup improves segmentation performance in $18$ out of $20$ investigated setups.</description>

      <title>CADMR: Cross-Attention and Disentangled Learning for Multimodal Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability and diversity of multimodal data in recommender systems offer new avenues for enhancing recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction. However, these systems must contend with high-dimensional, sparse user-item rating matrices, where reconstructing the matrix with only small subsets of preferred items for each user poses a significant challenge. To address this, we propose CADMR, a novel autoencoder-based multimodal recommender system framework. CADMR leverages multi-head cross-attention mechanisms and Disentangled Learning to effectively integrate and utilize heterogeneous multimodal data in reconstructing the rating matrix. Our approach first disentangles modality-specific features while preserving their interdependence, thereby learning a joint latent representation. The multi-head cross-attention mechanism is then applied to enhance user-item interaction representations with respect to the learned multimodal item latent representations. We evaluate CADMR on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Photovoltaic Power Forecasting: An iTransformer and LSTM-Based Model Integrating Temporal and Covariate Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is critical for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid, optimizing real-time energy management, and ensuring energy reliability amidst increasing demand. However, existing models often struggle with effectively capturing the complex relationships between target variables and covariates, as well as the interactions between temporal dynamics and multivariate data, leading to suboptimal forecasting accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model architecture that leverages the iTransformer for feature extraction from target variables and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract features from covariates. A cross-attention mechanism is integrated to fuse the outputs of both models, followed by a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) mapping for enhanced representation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated using publicly available datasets from Australia, with experiments conducted across four seasons. Results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively capture seasonal variations in PV power generation and improve forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sample Efficient Robot Learning in Supervised Effect Prediction Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In self-supervised robot learning, robots actively explore their environments and generate data by acting on entities in the environment. Therefore, an exploration policy is desired that ensures sample efficiency to minimize robot execution costs while still providing accurate learning. For this purpose, the robotic community has adopted Intrinsic Motivation (IM)-based approaches such as Learning Progress (LP). On the machine learning front, Active Learning (AL) has been used successfully, especially for classification tasks. In this work, we develop a novel AL framework geared towards robotics regression tasks, such as action-effect prediction and, more generally, for world model learning, which we call MUSEL - Model Uncertainty for Sample Efficient Learning. MUSEL aims to extract model uncertainty from the total uncertainty estimate given by a suitable learning engine by making use of earning progress and input diversity and use it to improve sample efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art action-effect prediction methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model by using a Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) as the learning engine and testing the system on a set of robotic experiments in simulation. The efficacy of MUSEL is demonstrated by comparing its performance to standard methods used in robot action-effect learning. In a robotic tabletop environment in which a robot manipulator is tasked with learning the effect of its actions, the experiments show that MUSEL facilitates higher accuracy in learning action effects while ensuring sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning to learn quantum states for Heisenberg scaling accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing the potential of quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. For learning quantum states, our scheme trains a Hardware efficient ansatz with a blackbox optimization algorithm, called evolution strategy (ES). To enhance the efficiency of ES, a RL agent dynamically adjusts the hyperparameters of ES. To facilitate the RL training, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We showcase that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can be generalized to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applicable to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Prompt Middleware: Contextual Prompt Refinement Controls for Comprehension Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective prompting of generative AI is challenging for many users, particularly in expressing context for comprehension tasks such as explaining spreadsheet formulas, Python code, and text passages. Prompt middleware aims to address this barrier by assisting in prompt construction, but barriers remain for users in expressing adequate control so that they can receive AI-responses that match their preferences.
  We conduct a formative survey (n=38) investigating user needs for control over AI-generated explanations in comprehension tasks, which uncovers a trade-off between standardized but predictable support for prompting, and adaptive but unpredictable support tailored to the user and task. To explore this trade-off, we implement two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control (Dynamic PRC) and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static PRC). The Dynamic PRC approach generates context-specific UI elements that provide prompt refinements based on the user's prompt and user needs from the AI, while the Static PRC approach offers a preset list of generally applicable refinements.
  We evaluate these two approaches with a controlled user study (n=16) to assess the impact of these approaches on user control of AI responses for crafting better explanations. Results show a preference for the Dynamic PRC approach as it afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context, and encouraged exploration and reflection of the tasks, but that reasoning about the effects of different generated controls on the final output remains challenging. Drawing on participant feedback, we discuss design implications for future Dynamic PRC systems that enhance user control of AI responses. Our findings suggest that dynamic prompt middleware can improve the user experience of generative AI workflows by affording greater control and guide users to a better AI response.</description>

      <title>HERO: Hint-Based Efficient and Reliable Query Optimizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model for learned query optimization which provides query hints leading to better execution plans. The model addresses the three key challenges in learned hint-based query optimization: reliable hint recommendation (ensuring non-degradation of query latency), efficient hint exploration, and fast inference. We provide an in-depth analysis of existing NN-based approaches to hint-based optimization and experimentally confirm the named challenges for them. Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints. Controlling the degree of parallelism (query dop) in addition to operator-related hints enables our model to achieve 3x latency improvement on JOB benchmark which sets a new standard for optimization. Our model is interpretable and easy to debug, which is particularly important for deployment in production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) models are often black boxes, making their decision-making processes difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency has driven advancements in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field dedicated to clarifying the reasoning behind DL model predictions. Among these, attribution-based methods such as LRP and GradCAM are widely used, though they rely on approximations that can be imprecise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce One Matrix to Explain Neural Networks (OMENN), a novel post-hoc method that represents a neural network as a single, interpretable matrix for each specific input. This matrix is constructed through a series of linear transformations that represent the processing of the input by each successive layer in the neural network. As a result, OMENN provides locally precise, attribution-based explanations of the input across various modern models, including ViTs and CNNs. We present a theoretical analysis of OMENN based on dynamic linearity property and validate its effectiveness with extensive tests on two XAI benchmarks, demonstrating that OMENN is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Extensible Structured Text Generation in PLCs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are microcomputers essential for automating factory operations. Structured Text (ST), a high-level language adhering to the IEC 61131-3 standard, is pivotal for PLCs due to its ability to express logic succinctly and to seamlessly integrate with other languages within the same standard. However, vendors develop their own customized versions of ST, and the lack of comprehensive and standardized documentation for the full semantics of ST has contributed to inconsistencies in how the language is implemented. Consequently, the steep learning curve associated with ST, combined with ever-evolving industrial requirements, presents significant challenges for developers. In response to these issues, we present AutoPLC, an LLM-based approach designed to automate the generation of vendor-specific ST code. To facilitate effective code generation, we first built a comprehensive knowledge base, including Rq2ST Case Library (requirements and corresponding implementations) and Instruction libraries. Then we developed a retrieval module to incorporate the domain-specific knowledge by identifying pertinent cases and instructions, guiding the LLM to generate code that meets the requirements. In order to verify and improve the quality of the generated code, we designed an adaptable code checker. If errors are detected, we initiate an iterative self-improvement process to instruct the LLM to revise the generated code. We evaluate AutoPLC's performance against seven state-of-the-art baselines using three benchmarks, one for open-source basic ST and two for commercial Structured Control Language (SCL) from Siemens. The results show that our approach consistently achieves superior performance across all benchmarks. Ablation study emphasizes the significance of our modules. Further manual analysis confirm the practical utility of the ST code generated by AutoPLC.</description>

Abstract: We present VISTA (Visualization of Internal States and Their Associations), a novel pipeline for visually exploring and interpreting neural network representations. VISTA addresses the challenge of analyzing vast multidimensional spaces in modern machine learning models by mapping representations into a semantic 2D space. The resulting collages visually reveal patterns and relationships within internal representations. We demonstrate VISTA's utility by applying it to sparse autoencoder latents uncovering new properties and interpretations. We review the VISTA methodology, present findings from our case study ( https://got.drib.net/latents/ ), and discuss implications for neural network interpretability across various domains of machine learning.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Enhanced Conversational Recommendation via Transformer-based Sequential Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conversational recommender systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a set of items and item-related entities or attributes, e.g., director is a related entity of a movie. These items and item-related entities are often mentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential dependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we represent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned items and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in certain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related entities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of associations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge graphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called TSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our model TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of the mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with multi-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the enhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of TSCR.</description>

      <title>GerPS-Compare: Comparing NER methods for legal norm analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply NER to a particular sub-genre of legal texts in German: the genre of legal norms regulating administrative processes in public service administration. The analysis of such texts involves identifying stretches of text that instantiate one of ten classes identified by public service administration professionals. We investigate and compare three methods for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect these classes: a Rule-based system, deep discriminative models, and a deep generative model. Our results show that Deep Discriminative models outperform both the Rule-based system as well as the Deep Generative model, the latter two roughly performing equally well, outperforming each other in different classes. The main cause for this somewhat surprising result is arguably the fact that the classes used in the analysis are semantically and syntactically heterogeneous, in contrast to the classes used in more standard NER tasks. Deep Discriminative models appear to be better equipped for dealing with this heterogenerity than both generic LLMs and human linguists designing rule-based NER systems.</description>

      <title>BYE: Build Your Encoder with One Sequence of Exploration Data for Long-Term Dynamic Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic scene understanding remains a persistent challenge in robotic applications. Early dynamic mapping methods focused on mitigating the negative influence of short-term dynamic objects on camera motion estimation by masking or tracking specific categories, which often fall short in adapting to long-term scene changes. Recent efforts address object association in long-term dynamic environments using neural networks trained on synthetic datasets, but they still rely on predefined object shapes and categories. Other methods incorporate visual, geometric, or semantic heuristics for the association but often lack robustness. In this work, we introduce BYE, a class-agnostic, per-scene point cloud encoder that removes the need for predefined categories, shape priors, or extensive association datasets. Trained on only a single sequence of exploration data, BYE can efficiently perform object association in dynamically changing scenes. We further propose an ensembling scheme combining the semantic strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the scene-specific expertise of BYE, achieving a 7% improvement and a 95% success rate in object association tasks. Code and dataset are available at https://byencoder.github.io.</description>

      <title>Gracefully Filtering Backdoor Samples for Generative Large Language Models without Retraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks remain significant security threats to generative large language models (LLMs). Since generative LLMs output sequences of high-dimensional token logits instead of low-dimensional classification logits, most existing backdoor defense methods designed for discriminative models like BERT are ineffective for generative LLMs. Inspired by the observed differences in learning behavior between backdoor and clean mapping in the frequency space, we transform gradients of each training sample, directly influencing parameter updates, into the frequency space. Our findings reveal a distinct separation between the gradients of backdoor and clean samples in the frequency space. Based on this phenomenon, we propose Gradient Clustering in the Frequency Space for Backdoor Sample Filtering (GraCeFul), which leverages sample-wise gradients in the frequency space to effectively identify backdoor samples without requiring retraining LLMs. Experimental results show that GraCeFul outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, GraCeFul exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, achieving nearly 100% recall and F1 scores in identifying backdoor samples, reducing the average success rate of various backdoor attacks to 0% with negligible drops in clean accuracy across multiple free-style question answering datasets. Additionally, GraCeFul generalizes to Llama-2 and Vicuna. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GraceFul.</description>

      <title>OODFace: Benchmarking Robustness of Face Recognition under Common Corruptions and Appearance Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of deep learning, facial recognition technology has seen extensive research and rapid development. Although facial recognition is considered a mature technology, we find that existing open-source models and commercial algorithms lack robustness in certain real-world Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, raising concerns about the reliability of these systems. In this paper, we introduce OODFace, which explores the OOD challenges faced by facial recognition models from two perspectives: common corruptions and appearance variations. We systematically design 30 OOD scenarios across 9 major categories tailored for facial recognition. By simulating these challenges on public datasets, we establish three robustness benchmarks: LFW-C/V, CFP-FP-C/V, and YTF-C/V. We then conduct extensive experiments on 19 different facial recognition models and 3 commercial APIs, along with extended experiments on face masks, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and defense strategies to assess their robustness. Based on the results, we draw several key insights, highlighting the vulnerability of facial recognition systems to OOD data and suggesting possible solutions. Additionally, we offer a unified toolkit that includes all corruption and variation types, easily extendable to other datasets. We hope that our benchmarks and findings can provide guidance for future improvements in facial recognition model robustness.</description>

      <title>Pre-Deployment Information Sharing: A Zoning Taxonomy for Precursory Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Connected Automated Vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>WEM-GAN: Wavelet transform based facial expression manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facial expression manipulation aims to change human facial expressions without affecting face recognition. In order to transform the facial expressions to target expressions, previous methods relied on expression labels to guide the manipulation process. However, these methods failed to preserve the details of facial features, which causes the weakening or the loss of identity information in the output image. In our work, we propose WEM-GAN, in short for wavelet-based expression manipulation GAN, which puts more efforts on preserving the details of the original image in the editing process. Firstly, we take advantage of the wavelet transform technique and combine it with our generator with a U-net autoencoder backbone, in order to improve the generator's ability to preserve more details of facial features. Secondly, we also implement the high-frequency component discriminator, and use high-frequency domain adversarial loss to further constrain the optimization of our model, providing the generated face image with more abundant details. Additionally, in order to narrow the gap between generated facial expressions and target expressions, we use residual connections between encoder and decoder, while also using relative action units (AUs) several times. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that our model performs better in preserving identity features, editing capability, and image generation quality on the AffectNet dataset. It also shows superior performance in metrics such as Average Content Distance (ACD) and Expression Distance (ED).</description>

      <title>Semantic Tokens in Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures have recently garnered significant attention for their ability to improve truth grounding and coherence in natural language processing tasks. However, the reliability of RAG systems in producing accurate answers diminishes as the volume of data they access increases. Even with smaller datasets, these systems occasionally fail to address simple queries. This issue arises from their dependence on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which can introduce uncertainty into the system's outputs. In this work, I propose a novel Comparative RAG system that introduces an evaluator module to bridge the gap between probabilistic RAG systems and deterministically verifiable responses. The evaluator compares external recommendations with the retrieved document chunks, adding a decision-making layer that enhances the system's reliability. This approach ensures that the chunks retrieved are both semantically relevant and logically consistent with deterministic insights, thereby improving the accuracy and overall efficiency of RAG systems. This framework paves the way for more reliable and scalable question-answering applications in domains requiring high precision and verifiability.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Coronary Artery Stenosis in X-ray Angiography using Mamba Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronary artery disease stands as one of the primary contributors to global mortality rates. The automated identification of coronary artery stenosis from X-ray images plays a critical role in the diagnostic process for coronary heart disease. This task is challenging due to the complex structure of coronary arteries, intrinsic noise in X-ray images, and the fact that stenotic coronary arteries appear narrow and blurred in X-ray angiographies. This study employs five different variants of the Mamba-based model and one variant of the Swin Transformer-based model, primarily based on the U-Net architecture, for the localization of stenosis in Coronary artery disease. Our best results showed an F1 score of 68.79% for the U-Mamba BOT model, representing an 11.8% improvement over the semi-supervised approach.</description>

      <title>TAB-Fields: A Maximum Entropy Framework for Mission-Aware Adversarial Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental challenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such as reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies these adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address this challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable element, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require knowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on the adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an adversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained by their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to characterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific policies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a representation that captures adversary state distributions over time by computing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known constraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization problem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond mission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard planning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation with underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission constraints altogether. Evaluation videos and code are available at https://tab-fields.github.io.</description>

      <title>Generating Critical Scenarios for Testing Automated Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have demonstrated significant potential in revolutionizing transportation, yet ensuring their safety and reliability remains a critical challenge, especially when exposed to dynamic and unpredictable environments. Real-world testing of an Autonomous Driving System (ADS) is both expensive and risky, making simulation-based testing a preferred approach. In this paper, we propose AVASTRA, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to generate realistic critical scenarios for testing ADSs in simulation environments. To capture the complexity of driving scenarios, AVASTRA comprehensively represents the environment by both the internal states of an ADS under-test (e.g., the status of the ADS's core components, speed, or acceleration) and the external states of the surrounding factors in the simulation environment (e.g., weather, traffic flow, or road condition). AVASTRA trains the RL agent to effectively configure the simulation environment that places the AV in dangerous situations and potentially leads it to collisions. We introduce a diverse set of actions that allows the RL agent to systematically configure both environmental conditions and traffic participants. Additionally, based on established safety requirements, we enforce heuristic constraints to ensure the realism and relevance of the generated test scenarios. AVASTRA is evaluated on two popular simulation maps with four different road configurations. Our results show AVASTRA's ability to outperform the state-of-the-art approach by generating 30% to 115% more collision scenarios. Compared to the baseline based on Random Search, AVASTRA achieves up to 275% better performance. These results highlight the effectiveness of AVASTRA in enhancing the safety testing of AVs through realistic comprehensive critical scenario generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation Systems have become integral to modern user experiences, but lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Existing explainable recommendation methods are hindered by reliance on a post-hoc paradigm, wherein explanation generators are trained independently of the underlying recommender models. This paradigm necessitates substantial human effort in data construction and raises concerns about explanation reliability. In this paper, we present ExpCTR, a novel framework that integrates large language model based explanation generation directly into the CTR prediction process. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning, we employ two carefully designed reward mechanisms, LC alignment, which ensures explanations reflect user intentions, and IC alignment, which maintains consistency with traditional ID-based CTR models. Our approach incorporates an efficient training paradigm with LoRA and a three-stage iterative process. ExpCTR circumvents the need for extensive explanation datasets while fostering synergy between CTR prediction and explanation generation. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpCTR significantly enhances both recommendation accuracy and interpretability across three real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: Prefix circuits are fundamental components in digital adders, widely used in digital systems due to their efficiency in calculating carry signals. Synthesizing prefix circuits with minimized area and delay is crucial for enhancing the performance of modern computing systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a surprising ability to perform text generation tasks. We propose PrefixLLM, that leverages LLMs for prefix circuit synthesis. PrefixLLM transforms the prefix circuit synthesis task into a structured text generation problem, termed the Structured Prefix Circuit Representation (SPCR), and introduces an iterative framework to automatically and accurately generate valid SPCRs. We further present a design space exploration (DSE) framework that uses LLMs to iteratively search for area and delay optimized prefix circuits. Compared to state-of-the-art, PrefixLLM can reduce the area by 3.70% under the same delay constraint. This work highlights the use of LLMs in the synthesis of arithmetic circuits, which can be transformed into the structured text generation.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.</description>

      <title>AV-Odyssey Bench: Can Your Multimodal LLMs Really Understand Audio-Visual Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Reka Core, have expanded their capabilities to include vision and audio modalities. While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.</description>

      <title>Improving Dynamic Object Interactions in Text-to-Video Generation with AI Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large text-to-video models hold immense potential for a wide range of downstream applications. However, these models struggle to accurately depict dynamic object interactions, often resulting in unrealistic movements and frequent violations of real-world physics. One solution inspired by large language models is to align generated outputs with desired outcomes using external feedback. This enables the model to refine its responses autonomously, eliminating extensive manual data collection. In this work, we investigate the use of feedback to enhance the object dynamics in text-to-video models. We aim to answer a critical question: what types of feedback, paired with which specific self-improvement algorithms, can most effectively improve text-video alignment and realistic object interactions? We begin by deriving a unified probabilistic objective for offline RL finetuning of text-to-video models. This perspective highlights how design elements in existing algorithms like KL regularization and policy projection emerge as specific choices within a unified framework. We then use derived methods to optimize a set of text-video alignment metrics (e.g., CLIP scores, optical flow), but notice that they often fail to align with human perceptions of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging vision-language models to provide more nuanced feedback specifically tailored to object dynamics in videos. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively optimize a wide variety of rewards, with binary AI feedback driving the most significant improvements in video quality for dynamic interactions, as confirmed by both AI and human evaluations. Notably, we observe substantial gains when using reward signals derived from AI feedback, particularly in scenarios involving complex interactions between multiple objects and realistic depictions of objects falling.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Scaling Image Tokenizers with Grouped Spherical Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision tokenizers have gained a lot of attraction due to their scalability and compactness; previous works depend on old-school GAN-based hyperparameters, biased comparisons, and a lack of comprehensive analysis of the scaling behaviours. To tackle those issues, we introduce Grouped Spherical Quantization (GSQ), featuring spherical codebook initialization and lookup regularization to constrain codebook latent to a spherical surface. Our empirical analysis of image tokenizer training strategies demonstrates that GSQ-GAN achieves superior reconstruction quality over state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations, providing a solid foundation for scaling studies. Building on this, we systematically examine the scaling behaviours of GSQ, specifically in latent dimensionality, codebook size, and compression ratios, and their impact on model performance. Our findings reveal distinct behaviours at high and low spatial compression levels, underscoring challenges in representing high-dimensional latent spaces. We show that GSQ can restructure high-dimensional latent into compact, low-dimensional spaces, thus enabling efficient scaling with improved quality. As a result, GSQ-GAN achieves a 16x down-sampling with a reconstruction FID (rFID) of 0.50.</description>

Abstract: In this work we explore utilizing LLMs for data augmentation for manufacturing task guidance system. The dataset consists of representative samples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing setting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for the supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We observe that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure specification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and are grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the performance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using each LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using LLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating the ratings with experts.</description>

      <title>Scaffold or Crutch? Examining College Students' Use and Views of Generative AI Tools for STEM Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing problem-solving competency is central to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, yet translating this priority into effective approaches to problem-solving instruction and assessment remain a significant challenge. The recent proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools like ChatGPT in higher education introduces new considerations about how these tools can help or hinder students' development of STEM problem-solving competency. Our research examines these considerations by studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM coursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM college students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in STEM courses. Our findings reveal high adoption rates and diverse applications of genAI tools among STEM students. The most common use cases include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save time. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting problems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies. The study also explored students' and STEM instructors' perceptions of the benefits and risks associated with using genAI tools in STEM education. Our findings provide insights into how to guide students on appropriate genAI use in STEM courses and how to design genAI-based tools to foster students' problem-solving competency.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to active and reactive power consumption patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <title>AniGS: Animatable Gaussian Avatar from a Single Image with Inconsistent Gaussian Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating animatable human avatars from a single image is essential for various digital human modeling applications. Existing 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to capture fine details in animatable models, while generative approaches for controllable animation, though avoiding explicit 3D modeling, suffer from viewpoint inconsistencies in extreme poses and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging the power of generative models to produce detailed multi-view canonical pose images, which help resolve ambiguities in animatable human reconstruction. We then propose a robust method for 3D reconstruction of inconsistent images, enabling real-time rendering during inference. Specifically, we adapt a transformer-based video generation model to generate multi-view canonical pose images and normal maps, pretraining on a large-scale video dataset to improve generalization. To handle view inconsistencies, we recast the reconstruction problem as a 4D task and introduce an efficient 3D modeling approach using 4D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves photorealistic, real-time animation of 3D human avatars from in-the-wild images, showcasing its effectiveness and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.</description>

      <title>Taming Scalable Visual Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing vector quantization (VQ) methods struggle with scalability, largely attributed to the instability of the codebook that undergoes partial updates during training. The codebook is prone to collapse as utilization decreases, due to the progressively widening distribution gap between non-activated codes and visual features. To solve the problem, we propose Index Backpropagation Quantization (IBQ), a new VQ method for the joint optimization of all codebook embeddings and the visual encoder. Applying a straight-through estimator on the one-hot categorical distribution between the encoded feature and codebook, all codes are differentiable and maintain a consistent latent space with the visual encoder. IBQ enables scalable training of visual tokenizers and, for the first time, achieves a large-scale codebook ($2^{18}$) with high dimension ($256$) and high utilization. Experiments on the standard ImageNet benchmark demonstrate the scalability and superiority of IBQ, achieving competitive results on both reconstruction ($1.00$ rFID) and autoregressive visual generation ($2.05$ gFID). The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Voken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of BERT based models for automated punctuation and capitalization corrections in Turkish texts across five distinct model sizes. The models are designated as Tiny, Mini, Small, Medium, and Base. The design and capabilities of each model are tailored to address the specific challenges of the Turkish language, with a focus on optimizing performance while minimizing computational overhead. The study presents a systematic comparison of the performance metrics precision, recall, and F1 score of each model, offering insights into their applicability in diverse operational contexts. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in text readability and accuracy as model size increases, with the Base model achieving the highest correction precision. This research provides a comprehensive guide for selecting the appropriate model size based on specific user needs and computational resources, establishing a framework for deploying these models in real-world applications to enhance the quality of written Turkish.</description>

Abstract: Formal explainability guarantees the rigor of computed explanations, and so it is paramount in domains where rigor is critical, including those deemed high-risk. Unfortunately, since its inception formal explainability has been hampered by poor scalability. At present, this limitation still holds true for some families of classifiers, the most significant being deep neural networks. This paper addresses the poor scalability of formal explainability and proposes novel efficient algorithms for computing formal explanations. The novel algorithm computes explanations by answering instead a number of robustness queries, and such that the number of such queries is at most linear on the number of features. Consequently, the proposed algorithm establishes a direct relationship between the practical complexity of formal explainability and that of robustness. To achieve the proposed goals, the paper generalizes the definition of formal explanations, thereby allowing the use of robustness tools that are based on different distance norms, and also by reasoning in terms of some target degree of robustness. Preliminary experiments validate the practical efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: Model-based reasoning agents are ill-equipped to act in novel situations in which their model of the environment no longer sufficiently represents the world. We propose HYDRA - a framework for designing model-based agents operating in mixed discrete-continuous worlds, that can autonomously detect when the environment has evolved from its canonical setup, understand how it has evolved, and adapt the agents' models to perform effectively. HYDRA is based upon PDDL+, a rich modeling language for planning in mixed, discrete-continuous environments. It augments the planning module with visual reasoning, task selection, and action execution modules for closed-loop interaction with complex environments. HYDRA implements a novel meta-reasoning process that enables the agent to monitor its own behavior from a variety of aspects. The process employs a diverse set of computational methods to maintain expectations about the agent's own behavior in an environment. Divergences from those expectations are useful in detecting when the environment has evolved and identifying opportunities to adapt the underlying models. HYDRA builds upon ideas from diagnosis and repair and uses a heuristics-guided search over model changes such that they become competent in novel conditions. The HYDRA framework has been used to implement novelty-aware agents for three diverse domains - CartPole++ (a higher dimension variant of a classic control problem), Science Birds (an IJCAI competition problem), and PogoStick (a specific problem domain in Minecraft). We report empirical observations from these domains to demonstrate the efficacy of various components in the novelty meta-reasoning process.</description>

      <title>Exploring the hierarchical structure of human plans via program generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human behavior is often assumed to be hierarchically structured, made up of abstract actions that can be decomposed into concrete actions. However, behavior is typically measured as a sequence of actions, which makes it difficult to infer its hierarchical structure. In this paper, we explore how people form hierarchically structured plans, using an experimental paradigm with observable hierarchical representations: participants create programs that produce sequences of actions in a language with explicit hierarchical structure. This task lets us test two well-established principles of human behavior: utility maximization (i.e. using fewer actions) and minimum description length (MDL; i.e. having a shorter program). We find that humans are sensitive to both metrics, but that both accounts fail to predict a qualitative feature of human-created programs, namely that people prefer programs with reuse over and above the predictions of MDL. We formalize this preference for reuse by extending the MDL account into a generative model over programs, modeling hierarchy choice as the induction of a grammar over actions. Our account can explain the preference for reuse and provides better predictions of human behavior, going beyond simple accounts of compressibility to highlight a principle that guides hierarchical planning.</description>

      <title>Governance of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Companies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.</description>

      <title>The Logic of Counterfactuals and the Epistemology of Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economics recognizes a type of causal model known as the Rubin causal model, or potential outcome framework, which deserves far more attention from philosophers than it currently receives. To spark philosophers' interest, I develop a dialectic connecting the Rubin causal model to the Lewis-Stalnaker debate on a logical principle of counterfactuals: Conditional Excluded Middle (CEM). I begin by playing good cop for CEM, developing a new argument in its favor -- a Quine-Putnam-style indispensability argument. This argument is based on the observation that CEM seems to be indispensable to the Rubin causal model, which underpins our best scientific theory of causal inference in health and social sciences -- a Nobel Prize-winning theory. Indeed, CEM has long remained a core assumption of the Rubin causal model, despite challenges from within the statistics and economics communities over twenty years ago. I then switch sides to play bad cop for CEM, undermining the indispensability argument by developing a new theory of causal inference that dispenses with CEM while preserving the successes of the original theory (thanks to a new theorem proved here). The key, somewhat surprisingly, is to integrate two approaches to causal modeling: the Rubin causal model, more familiar in health and social sciences, and the causal Bayes net, more familiar in philosophy. The good cop/bad cop dialectic is concluded with a connection to broader philosophical issues, including intertheory relations, the revisability of logic, and the role of background assumptions in justifying scientific inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatically generating novel and interesting games is a complex task. Challenges include representing game rules in a computationally workable form, searching through the large space of potential games under most such representations, and accurately evaluating the originality and quality of previously unseen games. Prior work in automated game generation has largely focused on relatively restricted rule representations and relied on domain-specific heuristics. In this work, we explore the generation of novel games in the comparatively expansive Ludii game description language, which encodes the rules of over 1000 board games in a variety of styles and modes of play. We draw inspiration from recent advances in large language models and evolutionary computation in order to train a model that intelligently mutates and recombines games and mechanics expressed as code. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our approach is capable of generating new and interesting games, including in regions of the potential rules space not covered by existing games in the Ludii dataset. A sample of the generated games are available to play online through the Ludii portal.</description>

      <title>ST-WebAgentBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Safety and Trustworthiness in Web Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Web agents have introduced novel architectures and benchmarks showcasing progress in autonomous web navigation and interaction. However, most existing benchmarks prioritize effectiveness and accuracy, overlooking factors like safety and trustworthiness which are essential for deploying web agents in enterprise settings. We present STWebAgentBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate web agents safety and trustworthiness across six critical dimensions, essential for reliability in enterprise applications. This benchmark is grounded in a detailed framework that defines safe and trustworthy (ST) agent behavior. Our work extends WebArena with safety templates and evaluation functions to assess safety policy compliance rigorously. We introduce the Completion Under Policy to measure task success while adhering to policies, alongside the Risk Ratio, which quantifies policy violations across dimensions, providing actionable insights to address safety gaps. Our evaluation reveals that current SOTA agents struggle with policy adherence and cannot yet be relied upon for critical business applications. We open-source this benchmark and invite the community to contribute, with the goal of fostering a new generation of safer, more trustworthy AI agents. All code, data, environment reproduction resources, and video demonstrations are available at https://sites.google.com/view/st-webagentbench/home.</description>

      <title>Proactive Agent: Shifting LLM Agents from Reactive Responses to Active Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agents powered by large language models have shown remarkable abilities in solving complex tasks. However, most agent systems remain reactive, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios requiring foresight and autonomous decision-making. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of developing proactive agents capable of anticipating and initiating tasks without explicit human instructions. We propose a novel data-driven approach for this problem. Firstly, we collect real-world human activities to generate proactive task predictions. These predictions are then labeled by human annotators as either accepted or rejected. The labeled data is used to train a reward model that simulates human judgment and serves as an automatic evaluator of the proactiveness of LLM agents. Building on this, we develop a comprehensive data generation pipeline to create a diverse dataset, ProactiveBench, containing 6,790 events. Finally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning models with the proposed ProactiveBench can significantly elicit the proactiveness of LLM agents. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model achieves an F1-Score of 66.47% in proactively offering assistance, outperforming all open-source and close-source models. These results highlight the potential of our method in creating more proactive and effective agent systems, paving the way for future advancements in human-agent collaboration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs exhibit advanced reasoning capabilities, offering the potential to transform natural language questions into mathematical models. However, existing open-source datasets in operations research domain lack detailed annotations of the modeling process, such as variable definitions, focusing solely on objective values, which hinders reinforcement learning applications. To address this, we release the StructuredOR dataset, annotated with comprehensive labels that capture the complete mathematical modeling process. We further propose BPP-Search, a algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning into a tree-of-thought structure using Beam search, a Process reward model, and a pairwise Preference algorithm. This approach enables efficient exploration of tree structures, avoiding exhaustive search while improving accuracy. Extensive experiments on StructuredOR, NL4OPT, and MAMO-ComplexLP datasets show that BPP-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In tree-based reasoning, BPP-Search excels in accuracy and efficiency, enabling faster retrieval of correct solutions.</description>

Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</description>

      <title>Predictive Models in Sequential Recommendations: Bridging Performance Laws with Data Quality Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a critical role in predicting users' sequential preferences. Despite its growing prominence in various industries, the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs and unpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Under this predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examining the loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between loss and model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications. Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive and inefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the capabilities of code large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, their applications across diverse code intelligence domains are rapidly increasing. However, most existing datasets only evaluate limited application domains. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive code evaluation dataset FullStack Bench focusing on full-stack programming, which encompasses a wide range of application domains (e.g., basic programming, data analysis, software engineering, mathematics, and machine learning). Besides, to assess multilingual programming capabilities, in FullStack Bench, we design real-world instructions and corresponding unit test cases from 16 widely-used programming languages to reflect real-world usage scenarios rather than simple translations. Moreover, we also release an effective code sandbox execution tool (i.e., SandboxFusion) supporting various programming languages and packages to evaluate the performance of our FullStack Bench efficiently. Comprehensive experimental results on our FullStack Bench demonstrate the necessity and effectiveness of our FullStack Bench and SandboxFusion.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM for Automated Ontology Extraction and Knowledge Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting relevant and structured knowledge from large, complex technical documents within the Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) domain is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Our work addresses this challenge by presenting OntoKGen, a genuine pipeline for ontology extraction and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation. OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.</description>

      <title>CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</description>

Abstract: Apache Spark is better suited for load data mining and machine learning that require a lot of iteration by using memory-distributed data sets. Due to the complexity of Spark, the high learning threshold of Scala, and the low reusability of its code, this paper designs and implements a Spark-based visual process AI+machine learning method under a big data environment.

      <title>MBA-RAG: a Bandit Approach for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Question Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result. Our method achieves new state of the art results on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while reducing retrieval costs.

      <title>A Single-Loop Gradient Descent and Perturbed Ascent Algorithm for Nonconvex Functional Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be used to model a number of machine learning problems, such as multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision processes. However, such kinds of problems are challenging because both the objective and constraints are possibly nonconvex, so it is difficult to balance the reduction of the loss value and reduction of constraint violation. Although there are a few methods that solve this class of problems, all of them are double-loop or triple-loop algorithms, and they require oracles to solve some subproblems up to certain accuracy by tuning multiple hyperparameters at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel gradient descent and perturbed ascent (GDPA) algorithm to solve a class of smooth nonconvex inequality constrained problems. The GDPA is a primal-dual algorithm, which only exploits the first-order information of both the objective and constraint functions to update the primal and dual variables in an alternating way. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is a single-loop algorithm, where only two step-sizes need to be tuned. We show that under a mild regularity condition GDPA is able to find Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of nonconvex functional constrained problems with convergence rate guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first single-loop algorithm that can solve the general nonconvex smooth problems with nonconvex inequality constraints. Numerical results also showcase the superiority of GDPA compared with the best-known algorithms (in terms of both stationarity measure and feasibility of the obtained solutions).</description>

      <title>Synergies Between Federated Learning and O-RAN: Towards an Elastic Architecture for Multiple Distributed Machine Learning Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning (ML) technique. However, implementation of FL over 5G-and-beyond wireless networks faces key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the wireless network conditions and (ii) the coexistence of multiple FL-services in the system, which are not jointly considered in prior works. We first take a closer look into these challenges and unveil nuanced phenomena called over-/under-provisioning of resources and perspective-driven load balancing. We then take the first steps towards addressing these phenomena by proposing a novel distributed ML architecture called elastic FL (EFL). EFL unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an elastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL-services. It further constitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three dedicated network control functionalities tailored for FL-services, including (i) non-real-time (non-RT) system descriptor, which trains ML-based applications to predicted both system and FL-related dynamics and parameters; (ii) near-RT FL controller, which handles O-RAN slicing and mobility management for the seamless execution of FL-services; (iii) FL MAC scheduler, which conducts real-time resource allocation to the end clients of various FL-services. We finally prototype EFL to demonstrate its potential in improving the performance of FL-services.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Sequential Volumetric Design Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volumetric design, also called massing design, is the first and critical step in professional building design which is sequential in nature. As the volumetric design process requires careful design decisions and iterative adjustments, the underlying sequential design process encodes valuable information for designers. Many efforts have been made to automatically generate reasonable volumetric designs, but the quality of the generated design solutions varies, and evaluating a design solution requires either a prohibitively comprehensive set of metrics or expensive human expertise. While previous approaches focused on learning only the final design instead of sequential design tasks, we propose to encode the design knowledge from a collection of expert or high-performing design sequences and extract useful representations using transformer-based models. Later we propose to utilize the learned representations for crucial downstream applications such as design preference evaluation and procedural design generation. We develop the preference model by estimating the density of the learned representations whereas we train an autoregressive transformer model for sequential design generation. We demonstrate our ideas by leveraging a novel dataset of thousands of sequential volumetric designs. Our preference model can compare two arbitrarily given design sequences and is almost $90\%$ accurate in evaluation against random design sequences. Our autoregressive model is also capable of autocompleting a volumetric design sequence from a partial design sequence.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Comprehending Users' Preferences for Accurate Personalized News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09401v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to assist users in finding news articles that align with their interests, which plays a pivotal role in mitigating users' information overload problem. Although many recent works have been studied for better personalized news recommendation, the following challenges should be explored more: (C1) Comprehending manifold intents coupled within a news article, (C2) Differentiating varying post-read preferences of news articles, and (C3) Addressing the cold-start user problem. To tackle the aforementioned challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel personalized news recommendation framework (CROWN) that employs (1) category-guided intent disentanglement for (C1), (2) consistency-based news representation for (C2), and (3) GNN-enhanced hybrid user representation for (C3). Furthermore, we incorporate a category prediction into the training process of CROWN as an auxiliary task, which provides supplementary supervisory signals to enhance intent disentanglement. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets reveal that (1) CROWN provides consistent performance improvements over ten state-of-the-art news recommendation methods and (2) the proposed strategies significantly improve the accuracy of CROWN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uplift modeling comprises a collection of machine learning techniques designed for managers to predict the incremental impact of specific actions on customer outcomes. However, accurately estimating this incremental impact poses significant challenges due to the necessity of determining the difference between two mutually exclusive outcomes for each individual. In our study, we introduce two novel modifications to the established Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) technique. These modifications sequentially learn the causal effect, addressing the counterfactual dilemma. Each modification innovates upon the existing technique in terms of the ensemble learning method and the learning objective, respectively. Experiments with large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, consistently achieving substantial improvements over baseline models.</description>

      <title>CultureLLM: Incorporating Cultural Differences into Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reported to be partial to certain cultures owing to the training data dominance from the English corpora. Since multilingual cultural data are often expensive to collect, existing efforts handle this by prompt engineering or culture-specific pre-training. However, they might overlook the knowledge deficiency of low-resource culture and require extensive computing resources. In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM adopts World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data via the proposed semantic data augmentation. Using only 50 seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs and one unified model (CultureLLM-One) for 9 cultures covering rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on 60 culture-related datasets demonstrate that CultureLLM significantly outperforms various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by 8.1%) and Gemini Pro (by 9.5%) with comparable performance to GPT-4 or even better. Our human study shows that the generated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples, providing an effective solution for LLMs augmentation.

      <title>EVOR: Evolving Retrieval for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been successfully applied in code generation. However, existing pipelines for retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) employ static knowledge bases with a single source, limiting the adaptation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to domains they have insufficient knowledge of. In this work, we develop a novel pipeline, EVOR, that employs the synchronous evolution of both queries and diverse knowledge bases. On two realistic settings where the external knowledge is required to solve code generation tasks, we compile four new datasets associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages, named EVOR-BENCH. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOR achieves two to four times of execution accuracy compared to other methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), DocPrompting (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. We demonstrate that EVOR is flexible and can be easily combined with them to achieve further improvement. Further analysis reveals that EVOR benefits from the synchronous evolution of queries and documents and the diverse information sources in the knowledge base. We hope that our studies will inspire more insights into the design of advanced RACG pipelines in future research. Our model, code, and data are available at https://arks-codegen.github.io.</description>

      <title>Using text embedding models as text classifiers with medical data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising and LLMs have been applied to numerous fields. However, it is not trivial to implement LLMs in the medical field, due to the high standards for precision and accuracy. Currently, the diagnosis of medical ailments must be done by hand, as it is costly to build a sufficiently broad LLM that can diagnose a wide range of diseases. Here, we explore the use of vector databases and embedding models as a means of encoding and classifying text with medical text data without the need to train a new model altogether. We used various LLMs to generate the medical data, then encoded the data with a text embedding model and stored it in a vector database. We hypothesized that higher embedding dimensions coupled with descriptive data in the vector database would lead to better classifications and designed a robustness test to test our hypothesis. By using vector databases and text embedding models to classify a clinician's notes on a patient presenting with a certain ailment, we showed that these tools can be successful at classifying medical text data. We found that a higher embedding dimension did indeed yield better results, however, querying with simple data in the database was optimal for performance. We have shown in this study the applicability of text embedding models and vector databases on a small scale, and our work lays the groundwork for applying these tools on a larger scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented surge in video data production in recent years necessitates efficient tools to extract meaningful frames from videos for downstream tasks. Long-term temporal reasoning is a key desideratum for frame retrieval systems. While state-of-the-art foundation models, like VideoLLaMA and ViCLIP, are proficient in short-term semantic understanding, they surprisingly fail at long-term reasoning across frames. A key reason for this failure is that they intertwine per-frame perception and temporal reasoning into a single deep network. Hence, decoupling but co-designing semantic understanding and temporal reasoning is essential for efficient scene identification. We propose a system that leverages vision-language models for semantic understanding of individual frames but effectively reasons about the long-term evolution of events using state machines and temporal logic (TL) formulae that inherently capture memory. Our TL-based reasoning improves the F1 score of complex event identification by 9-15% compared to benchmarks that use GPT4 for reasoning on state-of-the-art self-driving datasets such as Waymo and NuScenes.</description>

      <title>Text Clustering with Large Language Model Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15112v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text clustering is an important method for organising the increasing volume of digital content, aiding in the structuring and discovery of hidden patterns in uncategorised data. The effectiveness of text clustering largely depends on the selection of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. This study argues that recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance this task. The research investigates how different textual embeddings, particularly those utilised in LLMs, and various clustering algorithms influence the clustering of text datasets. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of embeddings on clustering results, the role of dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and the adjustment of model size. The findings indicate that LLM embeddings are superior at capturing subtleties in structured language. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model yields better results in three out of five clustering metrics across most tested datasets. Most LLM embeddings show improvements in cluster purity and provide a more informative silhouette score, reflecting a refined structural understanding of text data compared to traditional methods. Among the more lightweight models, BERT demonstrates leading performance. Additionally, it was observed that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarisation techniques do not consistently enhance clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful consideration for practical application. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by integrating embeddings from LLMs, offering improved methodologies and suggesting new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning language models with human preferences. While the significance of dataset quality is generally recognized, explicit investigations into its impact within the RLHF framework, to our knowledge, have been limited. This paper addresses the issue of text quality within the preference dataset by focusing on direct preference optimization (DPO), an increasingly adopted reward-model-free RLHF method. We confirm that text quality significantly influences the performance of models optimized with DPO more than those optimized with reward-model-based RLHF. Building on this new insight, we propose an extension of DPO, termed filtered direct preference optimization (fDPO). fDPO uses a trained reward model to monitor the quality of texts within the preference dataset during DPO training. Samples of lower quality are discarded based on comparisons with texts generated by the model being optimized, resulting in a more accurate dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO enhances the final model performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/filtered-dpo.</description>

      <title>Paired Autoencoders for Likelihood-free Estimation in Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the solution of nonlinear inverse problems where the forward problem is a discretization of a partial differential equation. Such problems are notoriously difficult to solve in practice and require minimizing a combination of a data-fit term and a regularization term. The main computational bottleneck of typical algorithms is the direct estimation of the data misfit. Therefore, likelihood-free approaches have become appealing alternatives. Nonetheless, difficulties in generalization and limitations in accuracy have hindered their broader utility and applicability. In this work, we use a paired autoencoder framework as a likelihood-free estimator for inverse problems. We show that the use of such an architecture allows us to construct a solution efficiently and to overcome some known open problems when using likelihood-free estimators. In particular, our framework can assess the quality of the solution and improve on it if needed. We demonstrate the viability of our approach using examples from full waveform inversion and inverse electromagnetic imaging.</description>

This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration (i.e., determine which states to save and explore from, and what actions to consider next), which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these handcrafted heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant pretrained foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g., discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries-states encountered during exploration that are valuable in terms of exploration, yet where what makes them interesting was not anticipated by the human user. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse range of language and vision-based tasks that require search and exploration. Across these tasks, IGE strongly exceeds classic reinforcement learning and graph search baselines, and also succeeds where prior state-of-the-art FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, Intelligent Go-Explore combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</description>

      <title>OceanCastNet: A Deep Learning Ocean Wave Model with Energy Conservation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional wave forecasting models, although based on energy conservation equations, are computationally expensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning geophysical fluid models, while computationally efficient, often suffer from issues such as energy dissipation in long-term forecasts. This paper proposes a novel energy-balanced deep learning wave forecasting model called OceanCastNet (OCN). By incorporating wind fields at the current, previous, and future time steps, as well as wave fields at the current and previous time steps as input variables, OCN maintains energy balance within the model. Furthermore, the model employs adaptive Fourier operators as its core components and designs a masked loss function to better handle the impact of land-sea boundaries. A series of experiments on the ERA5 dataset demonstrate that OCN can achieve short-term forecast accuracy comparable to traditional models while exhibiting an understanding of the wave generation process. In comparative experiments under both normal and extreme conditions, OCN consistently outperforms the widely used WaveWatch III model in the industry. Even after long-term forecasting, OCN maintains a stable and energy-rich state. By further constructing a simple meteorological model, OCN-wind, which considers energy balance, this paper confirms the importance of energy constraints for improving the long-term forecast performance of deep learning meteorological models. This finding provides new ideas for future research on deep learning geophysical fluid models.</description>

      <title>Morescient GAI for Software Engineering (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of Generative AI (GAI) technology to automatically check, synthesize and modify software engineering artifacts promises to revolutionize all aspects of software engineering. Using GAI for software engineering tasks is consequently one of the most rapidly expanding fields of software engineering research, with over a hundred LLM-based code models having been published since 2021. However, the overwhelming majority of existing code models share a major weakness - they are exclusively trained on the syntactic facet of software, significantly lowering their trustworthiness in tasks dependent on software semantics. To address this problem, a new class of "Morescient" GAI is needed that is "aware" of (i.e., trained on) both the semantic and static facets of software. This, in turn, will require a new generation of software observation platforms capable of generating large quantities of execution observations in a structured and readily analyzable way. In this paper, we present a vision and roadmap for how such "Morescient" GAI models can be engineered, evolved and disseminated according to the principles of open science.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model-Enabled Low-Latency Semantic Communication in the Presence of Semantic Ambiguities and Wireless Channel Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based Semantic Communications (SemCom) is becoming critical to maximize overall efficiency of communication networks. Nevertheless, SemCom is sensitive to wireless channel uncertainties, source outliers, and suffer from poor generalization bottlenecks. To address the mentioned challenges, this paper develops a latent diffusion model-enabled SemCom system with three key contributions, i.e., i) to handle potential outliers in the source data, semantic errors obtained by projected gradient descent based on the vulnerabilities of DL models, are utilized to update the parameters and obtain an outlier-robust encoder, ii) a lightweight single-layer latent space transformation adapter completes one-shot learning at the transmitter and is placed before the decoder at the receiver, enabling adaptation for out-of-distribution data and enhancing human-perceptual quality, and iii) an end-to-end consistency distillation (EECD) strategy is used to distill the diffusion models trained in latent space, enabling deterministic single or few-step low-latency denoising in various noisy channels while maintaining high semantic quality. Extensive numerical experiments across different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SemCom system, consistently proving its robustness to outliers, the capability to transmit data with unknown distributions, and the ability to perform real-time channel denoising tasks while preserving high human perceptual quality, outperforming the existing denoising approaches in semantic metrics like learned perceptual image path similarity (LPIPS).</description>

      <title>Interventional Causal Discovery in a Mixture of DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal interactions among a group of variables are often modeled by a single causal graph. In some domains, however, these interactions are best described by multiple co-existing causal graphs, e.g., in dynamical systems or genomics. This paper addresses the hitherto unknown role of interventions in learning causal interactions among variables governed by a mixture of causal systems, each modeled by one directed acyclic graph (DAG). Causal discovery from mixtures is fundamentally more challenging than single-DAG causal discovery. Two major difficulties stem from (i)~an inherent uncertainty about the skeletons of the component DAGs that constitute the mixture and (ii)~possibly cyclic relationships across these component DAGs. This paper addresses these challenges and aims to identify edges that exist in at least one component DAG of the mixture, referred to as the true edges. First, it establishes matching necessary and sufficient conditions on the size of interventions required to identify the true edges. Next, guided by the necessity results, an adaptive algorithm is designed that learns all true edges using $O(n^2)$ interventions, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Remarkably, the size of the interventions is optimal if the underlying mixture model does not contain cycles across its components. More generally, the gap between the intervention size used by the algorithm and the optimal size is quantified. It is shown to be bounded by the cyclic complexity number of the mixture model, defined as the size of the minimal intervention that can break the cycles in the mixture, which is upper bounded by the number of cycles among the ancestors of a node.</description>

      <title>Center-Sensitive Kernel Optimization for Efficient On-Device Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To facilitate the evolution of edge intelligence in ever-changing environments, we study on-device incremental learning constrained in limited computation resource in this paper. Current on-device training methods just focus on efficient training without considering the catastrophic forgetting, preventing the model getting stronger when continually exploring the world. To solve this problem, a direct solution is to involve the existing incremental learning mechanisms into the on-device training framework. Unfortunately, such a manner cannot work well as those mechanisms usually introduce large additional computational cost to the network optimization process, which would inevitably exceed the memory capacity of the edge devices. To address this issue, this paper makes an early effort to propose a simple but effective edge-friendly incremental learning framework. Based on an empirical study on the knowledge intensity of the kernel elements of the neural network, we find that the center kernel is the key for maximizing the knowledge intensity for learning new data, while freezing the other kernel elements would get a good balance on the model's capacity for overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Upon this finding, we further design a center-sensitive kernel optimization framework to largely alleviate the cost of the gradient computation and back-propagation. Besides, a dynamic channel element selection strategy is also proposed to facilitate a sparse orthogonal gradient projection for further reducing the optimization complexity, upon the knowledge explored from the new task data. Extensive experiments validate our method is efficient and effective, e.g., our method achieves average accuracy boost of 38.08% with even less memory and approximate computation compared to existing on-device training methods, indicating its significant potential for on-device incremental learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Journalists are among the many users of large language models (LLMs). To better understand the journalist-AI interactions, we conduct a study of LLM usage by two news agencies through browsing the WildChat dataset, identifying candidate interactions, and verifying them by matching to online published articles. Our analysis uncovers instances where journalists provide sensitive material such as confidential correspondence with sources or articles from other agencies to the LLM as stimuli and prompt it to generate articles, and publish these machine-generated articles with limited intervention (median output-publication ROUGE-L of 0.62). Based on our findings, we call for further research into what constitutes responsible use of AI, and the establishment of clear guidelines and best practices on using LLMs in a journalistic context.</description>

      <title>QuadrupedGPT: Towards a Versatile Quadruped Agent in Open-ended Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As robotic agents increasingly assist humans in reality, quadruped robots offer unique opportunities for interaction in complex scenarios due to their agile movement. However, building agents that can autonomously navigate, adapt, and respond to versatile goals remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce QuadrupedGPT designed to follow diverse commands with agility comparable to that of a pet. The primary challenges addressed include: i) effectively utilizing multimodal observations for informed decision-making; ii) achieving agile control by integrating locomotion and navigation; iii) developing advanced cognition to execute long-term objectives. Our QuadrupedGPT interprets human commands and environmental contexts using a large multimodal model. Leveraging its extensive knowledge base, the agent autonomously assigns parameters for adaptive locomotion policies and devises safe yet efficient paths toward its goals. Additionally, it employs high-level reasoning to decompose long-term goals into a sequence of executable subgoals. Through comprehensive experiments, our agent shows proficiency in handling diverse tasks and intricate instructions, representing a significant step toward the development of versatile quadruped agents for open-ended environments.</description>

      <title>Point-SAM: Promptable 3D Segmentation Model for Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of 2D foundation models for image segmentation has been significantly advanced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, achieving similar success in 3D models remains a challenge due to issues such as non-unified data formats, poor model scalability, and the scarcity of labeled data with diverse masks. To this end, we propose a 3D promptable segmentation model Point-SAM, focusing on point clouds. We employ an efficient transformer-based architecture tailored for point clouds, extending SAM to the 3D domain. We then distill the rich knowledge from 2D SAM for Point-SAM training by introducing a data engine to generate part-level and object-level pseudo-labels at scale from 2D SAM. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art 3D segmentation models on several indoor and outdoor benchmarks and demonstrates a variety of applications, such as interactive 3D annotation and zero-shot 3D instance proposal. Codes and demo can be found at https://github.com/zyc00/Point-SAM.</description>

      <title>AdaZeta: Adaptive Zeroth-Order Tensor-Train Adaption for Memory-Efficient Large Language Models Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, yet it demands more and more memory as model sizes keep growing. To address this issue, the recently proposed Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) methods attempt to fine-tune LLMs using only forward passes, thereby avoiding the need for a backpropagation graph. However, significant performance drops and a high risk of divergence have limited their widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Zeroth-order Tensor-Train Adaption (AdaZeta) framework, specifically designed to improve the performance and convergence of the ZO methods. To enhance dimension-dependent ZO estimation accuracy, we introduce a fast-forward, low-parameter tensorized adapter. To tackle the frequently observed divergence issue in large-scale ZO fine-tuning tasks, we propose an adaptive query number schedule that guarantees convergence. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results on Roberta-Large and Llama-2-7B models substantiate the efficacy of our AdaZeta framework in terms of accuracy, memory efficiency, and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning with Lower Expectile Q-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a compelling approach that addresses the challenge of learning from limited, static data by generating imaginary trajectories using learned models. However, these approaches often struggle with inaccurate value estimation from model rollouts. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based offline RL method, Lower Expectile Q-learning (LEQ), which provides a low-bias model-based value estimation via lower expectile regression of $\lambda$-returns. Our empirical results show that LEQ significantly outperforms previous model-based offline RL methods on long-horizon tasks, such as the D4RL AntMaze tasks, matching or surpassing the performance of model-free approaches and sequence modeling approaches. Furthermore, LEQ matches the performance of state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods in dense-reward environments across both state-based tasks (NeoRL and D4RL) and pixel-based tasks (V-D4RL), showing that LEQ works robustly across diverse domains. Our ablation studies demonstrate that lower expectile regression, $\lambda$-returns, and critic training on offline data are all crucial for LEQ.</description>

      <title>Embedded Prompt Tuning: Towards Enhanced Calibration of Pretrained Models for Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01003v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale data have been widely witnessed to achieve success in various natural imaging downstream tasks. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to adapt foundation models to new domains by updating only a small portion of parameters in order to reduce computational overhead. However, the effectiveness of these PEFT methods, especially in cross-domain few-shot scenarios, e.g., medical image analysis, has not been fully explored. In this work, we facilitate the study of the performance of PEFT when adapting foundation models to medical image classification tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate the limitations of prompt introducing ways and approximation capabilities on Transformer architectures of mainstream prompt tuning methods, we propose the Embedded Prompt Tuning (EPT) method by embedding prompt tokens into the expanded channels. We also find that there are anomalies in the feature space distribution of foundation models during pre-training process, and prompt tuning can help mitigate this negative impact. To explain this phenomenon, we also introduce a novel perspective to understand prompt tuning: Prompt tuning is a distribution calibrator. And we support it by analyzing patch-wise scaling and feature separation operations contained in EPT. Our experiments show that EPT outperforms several state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods by a significant margin on few-shot medical image classification tasks, and completes the fine-tuning process within highly competitive time, indicating EPT is an effective PEFT method.

      <title>An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current strong pedestrian attribute recognition models are developed based on Transformer networks, which are computationally heavy. Recently proposed models with linear complexity (e.g., Mamba) have garnered significant attention and have achieved a good balance between accuracy and computational cost across a variety of visual tasks. Relevant review articles also suggest that while these models can perform well on some pedestrian attribute recognition datasets, they are generally weaker than the corresponding Transformer models. To further tap into the potential of the novel Mamba architecture for PAR tasks, this paper designs and adapts Mamba into two typical PAR frameworks, i.e., the text-image fusion approach and pure vision Mamba multi-label recognition framework. It is found that interacting with attribute tags as additional input does not always lead to an improvement, specifically, Vim can be enhanced, but VMamba cannot. This paper further designs various hybrid Mamba-Transformer variants and conducts thorough experimental validations. These experimental results indicate that simply enhancing Mamba with a Transformer does not always lead to performance improvements but yields better results under certain settings. We hope this empirical study can further inspire research in Mamba for PAR, and even extend into the domain of multi-label recognition, through the design of these network structures and comprehensive experimentation.

      <title>Stress-Testing Long-Context Language Models with Lifelong ICL and Task Haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn a sequence of language tasks through in-context learning (ICL). We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizes contexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expected to leverage the relevant demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, and achieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than those of the Single-task ICL baseline.
  Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted "needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) evaluation, but presents distinct new challenges. It requires models (1) to utilize the contexts at a deeper level, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) to navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, proxying the complexities and dynamism of contexts in real-world scenarios. Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.
  We benchmark 14 long-context LMs using Task Haystack, finding that frontier models like GPT-4o still struggle with the setting, failing on 15% of cases on average. Most open-weight models further lack behind by a large margin, with failure rates reaching up to 61%. In our controlled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency bias as contributors to these failure cases. Further, performance declines when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of long-context LMs.</description>

      <title>PITN: Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring blood pressure with non-invasive sensors has gained popularity for providing comfortable user experiences, one of which is a significant function of smart wearables. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</description>

      <title>PolarBEVDet: Exploring Polar Representation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection in Bird's-Eye-View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection provides an economical and deployment-friendly solution for autonomous driving. However, all the existing LSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the non-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view symmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution and preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the polar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To achieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to generate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for fusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the polar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D auxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve the quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively. Finally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object detector, PolarBEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes show that PolarBEVDet achieves the superior performance.

      <title>Bidirectional Decoding: Improving Action Chunking via Closed-Loop Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning from human demonstrations. Yet, its reported effects on the learned policy are inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity in stochastic environments. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence, which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast, which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions within and across action chunks, BID promotes consistency over time while maintaining reactivity to unexpected changes. Experimental results show that BID boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Code and videos are available at https://bid-robot.github.io.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Interpretation of Neural Network Latent Spaces with Symbolic Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated in many scientific fields that artificial neural networks like autoencoders or Siamese networks encode meaningful concepts in their latent spaces. However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. The approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.</description>

      <title>Harmful Fine-tuning Attacks and Defenses for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18169v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that the nascent fine-tuning-as-a-service business model exposes serious safety concerns -- fine-tuning over a few harmful data uploaded by the users can compromise the safety alignment of the model. The attack, known as harmful fine-tuning attack, has raised a broad research interest among the community. However, as the attack is still new, \textbf{we observe that there are general misunderstandings within the research community.} To clear up concern, this paper provide a comprehensive overview to three aspects of harmful fine-tuning: attacks setting, defense design and evaluation methodology. Specifically, we first present the threat model of the problem, and introduce the harmful fine-tuning attack and its variants. Then we systematically survey the existing literature on attacks/defenses/mechanical analysis of the problem. Finally, we introduce the evaluation methodology and outline future research directions that might contribute to the development of the field. Additionally, we present a list of questions of interest, which might be useful to refer to when reviewers in the peer review process question the realism of the experiment/attack/defense setting. A curated list of relevant papers is maintained and made accessible at: https://github.com/git-disl/awesome_LLM-harmful-fine-tuning-papers.</description>

      <title>From Seconds to Hours: Reviewing MultiModal Large Language Models on Comprehensive Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual encoders has recently shown promising performance in visual understanding tasks, leveraging their inherent capability to comprehend and generate human-like text for visual reasoning. Given the diverse nature of visual data, MultiModal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) exhibit variations in model designing and training for understanding images, short videos, and long videos. Our paper focuses on the substantial differences and unique challenges posed by long video understanding compared to static image and short video understanding. Unlike static images, short videos encompass sequential frames with both spatial and within-event temporal information, while long videos consist of multiple events with between-event and long-term temporal information. In this survey, we aim to trace and summarize the advancements of MM-LLMs from image understanding to long video understanding. We review the differences among various visual understanding tasks and highlight the challenges in long video understanding, including more fine-grained spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, and long-term dependencies. We then provide a detailed summary of the advancements in MM-LLMs in terms of model design and training methodologies for understanding long videos. Finally, we compare the performance of existing MM-LLMs on video understanding benchmarks of various lengths and discuss potential future directions for MM-LLMs in long video understanding.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Copyright Disputes and Generative AI Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes by formalizing relevant judicial principles within a coherent framework based on the random-worlds method. It provides a structured analysis of key evidentiary principles, with a particular focus on the ``inverse ratio rule"--a controversial doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Additionally, the paper examines the heightened copyright risks posed by generative AI, highlighting how extensive access to copyrighted material by generative models increases the risk of infringement. Utilizing the probabilistic approach, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a potential mitigation strategy, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings demonstrate how a rigorous probabilistic approach can advance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Salient Information Prompting to Steer Content in Prompt-based Abstractive Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent summaries across domains using prompting techniques, reducing the need to train models for summarization applications. However, crafting effective prompts that guide LLMs to generate summaries with the appropriate level of detail and writing style remains a challenge. In this paper, we explore the use of salient information extracted from the source document to enhance summarization prompts. We show that adding keyphrases in prompts can improve ROUGE F1 and recall, making the generated summaries more similar to the reference and more complete. The number of keyphrases can control the precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that incorporating phrase-level salient information is superior to word- or sentence-level. However, the impact on hallucination is not universally positive across LLMs. To conduct this analysis, we introduce Keyphrase Signal Extractor (SigExt), a lightweight model that can be finetuned to extract salient keyphrases. By using SigExt, we achieve consistent ROUGE improvements across datasets and open-weight and proprietary LLMs without any LLM customization. Our findings provide insights into leveraging salient information in building prompt-based summarization systems. We release our code at \url{https://github.com/amazon-science/SigExt}</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Perspective on Unlearning and Alignment for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an open research problem. Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework in LLMs. Namely, we derive novel metrics with high-probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Through a case study focused on unlearning, we reveal that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning, whereas our probabilistic evaluations demonstrate that most if not all of the supposedly unlearned information remains accessible in these models. Additionally, we propose a novel unlearning loss based on entropy optimization and adaptive temperature scaling, which significantly improves unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/yascho/probabilistic-unlearning.</description>

      <title>Learning General Representation of 12-Lead Electrocardiogram with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) captures the heart's electrical signals, offering valuable information for diagnosing cardiac conditions. However, the scarcity of labeled data makes it challenging to fully leverage supervised learning in medical domain. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, enabling models to learn from unlabeled data and uncover meaningful patterns. In this paper, we show that masked modeling in the latent space can be a powerful alternative to existing self-supervised methods in the ECG domain. We introduce ECG-JEPA, a SSL model for 12-lead ECG analysis that learns semantic representations of ECG data by predicting in the hidden latent space, bypassing the need to reconstruct raw signals. This approach offers several advantages in the ECG domain: (1) it avoids producing unnecessary details, such as noise, which is common in ECG; and (2) it addresses the limitations of na\"ive L2 loss between raw signals. Another key contribution is the introduction of Cross-Pattern Attention (CroPA), a specialized masked attention mechanism tailored for 12-lead ECG data. ECG-JEPA is trained on the union of several open ECG datasets, totaling approximately 180,000 samples, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks including ECG classification and feature prediction.

      <title>Burning RED: Unlocking Subtask-Driven Reinforcement Learning and Risk-Awareness in Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10578v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average-reward Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a foundational framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. However, average-reward MDPs have remained largely unexplored in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, with the majority of RL-based efforts having been allocated to episodic and discounted MDPs. In this work, we study a unique structural property of average-reward MDPs and utilize it to introduce Reward-Extended Differential (or RED) reinforcement learning: a novel RL framework that can be used to effectively and efficiently solve various subtasks simultaneously in the average-reward setting. We introduce a family of RED learning algorithms for prediction and control, including proven-convergent algorithms for the tabular case. We then showcase the power of these algorithms by demonstrating how they can be used to learn a policy that optimizes, for the first time, the well-known conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) risk measure in a fully-online manner, without the use of an explicit bi-level optimization scheme or an augmented state-space.</description>

      <title>ASTM :Autonomous Smart Traffic Management System Using Artificial Intelligence CNN and LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10929v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the modern world, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has contributed to improvements in various areas, including automation, computer vision, fraud detection, and more. AI can be leveraged to enhance the efficiency of Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (ASTM) systems and reduce traffic congestion rates. This paper presents an Autonomous Smart Traffic Management (STM) system that uses AI to improve traffic flow rates. The system employs the YOLO V5 Convolutional Neural Network to detect vehicles in traffic management images. Additionally, it predicts the number of vehicles for the next 12 hours using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). The Smart Traffic Management Cycle Length Analysis manages the traffic cycle length based on these vehicle predictions, aided by AI. From the results of the RNN-LSTM model for predicting vehicle numbers over the next 12 hours, we observe that the model predicts traffic with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.521 vehicles and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.232 vehicles. After simulating the STM system in the CARLA simulation environment, we found that the Traffic Management Congestion Flow Rate with ASTM (21 vehicles per minute) is 50\% higher than the rate without STM (around 15 vehicles per minute). Additionally, the Traffic Management Vehicle Pass Delay with STM (5 seconds per vehicle) is 70\% lower than without STM (around 12 seconds per vehicle). These results demonstrate that the STM system using AI can increase traffic flow by 50\% and reduce vehicle pass delays by 70\%.</description>

      <title>VibeCheck: Discover and Quantify Qualitative Differences in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit subtle yet distinctive characteristics in their outputs that users intuitively recognize, but struggle to quantify. These "vibes" -- such as tone, formatting, or writing style -- influence user preferences, yet traditional evaluations focus primarily on the singular axis of correctness. We introduce VibeCheck, a system for automatically comparing a pair of LLMs by discovering identifying traits of a model (vibes) that are well-defined, differentiating, and user-aligned. VibeCheck iteratively discovers vibes from model outputs and then utilizes a panel of LLM judges to quantitatively measure the utility of each vibe. We validate that the vibes generated by VibeCheck align with those found in human discovery and run VibeCheck on pairwise preference data from real-world user conversations with Llama-3-70b vs GPT-4. VibeCheck reveals that Llama has a friendly, funny, and somewhat controversial vibe. These vibes predict model identity with 80% accuracy and human preference with 61% accuracy. Lastly, we run VibeCheck on a variety of models and tasks including summarization, math, and captioning to provide insight into differences in model behavior. VibeCheck discovers vibes like Command X prefers to add concrete intros and conclusions when summarizing in comparison to TNGL, Llama-405b often overexplains its thought process on math problems compared to GPT-4o, and GPT-4 prefers to focus on the mood and emotions of the scene when captioning compared to Gemini-1.5-Flash.

      <title>Normalizing self-supervised learning for provably reliable Change Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Change point detection (CPD) methods aim to identify abrupt shifts in the distribution of input data streams. Accurate estimators for this task are crucial across various real-world scenarios. Yet, traditional unsupervised CPD techniques face significant limitations, often relying on strong assumptions or suffering from low expressive power due to inherent model simplicity. In contrast, representation learning methods overcome these drawbacks by offering flexibility and the ability to capture the full complexity of the data without imposing restrictive assumptions. However, these approaches are still emerging in the CPD field and lack robust theoretical foundations to ensure their reliability. Our work addresses this gap by integrating the expressive power of representation learning with the groundedness of traditional CPD techniques. We adopt spectral normalization (SN) for deep representation learning in CPD tasks and prove that the embeddings after SN are highly informative for CPD. Our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods during the comprehensive evaluation via three standard CPD datasets.</description>

      <title>MarineFormer: A Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for USV Navigation in Dynamic Marine Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating autonomously in marine environments including dynamic and static obstacles, and strong flow disturbances, such as in high-flow rivers, poses significant challenges for USVs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that leverages two types of attention: spatial attention, which learns to integrate diverse environmental factors and sensory information into navigation decisions, and temporal attention within a transformer framework to account for the dynamic, continuously changing nature of the environment. We devise MarineFormer, a Trans{\bf former}-based navigation policy for dynamic {\bf Marine} environments, trained end-to-end through reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, MarineFormer uses graph attention to capture spatial information and a transformer architecture to process temporal sequences in an environment that simulates a 2D turbulent marine condition involving multiple static and dynamic obstacles. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method versus the state-of-the-art methods, as well as other classical planners. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by nearly $20\%$ in episode completion success rate and additionally enhances the USV's path length efficiency.</description>

      <title>From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory Representation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.</description>

      <title>FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Nobel Prize Literature with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the capabilities of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly the o1 model, in the context of literary analysis. The outputs of these models are compared directly to those produced by graduate-level human participants. By focusing on two Nobel Prize-winning short stories, 'Nine Chapters' by Han Kang, the 2024 laureate, and 'Friendship' by Jon Fosse, the 2023 laureate, the research explores the extent to which AI can engage with complex literary elements such as thematic analysis, intertextuality, cultural and historical contexts, linguistic and structural innovations, and character development. Given the Nobel Prize's prestige and its emphasis on cultural, historical, and linguistic richness, applying LLMs to these works provides a deeper understanding of both human and AI approaches to interpretation. The study uses qualitative and quantitative evaluations of coherence, creativity, and fidelity to the text, revealing the strengths and limitations of AI in tasks typically reserved for human expertise. While LLMs demonstrate strong analytical capabilities, particularly in structured tasks, they often fall short in emotional nuance and coherence, areas where human interpretation excels. This research underscores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the humanities, opening new opportunities in literary studies and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Testbed for Cognitive Radio Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technological trends show that Radio Frequency Reinforcement Learning (RFRL) will play a prominent role in the wireless communication systems of the future. Applications of RFRL range from military communications jamming to enhancing WiFi networks. Before deploying algorithms for these purposes, they must be trained in a simulation environment to ensure adequate performance. For this reason, we previously created the RFRL Gym: a standardized, accessible tool for the development and testing of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the wireless communications space. This environment leveraged the OpenAI Gym framework and featured customizable simulation scenarios within the RF spectrum. However, the RFRL Gym was limited to training a single RL agent per simulation; this is not ideal, as most real-world RF scenarios will contain multiple intelligent agents in cooperative, competitive, or mixed settings, which is a natural consequence of spectrum congestion. Therefore, through integration with Ray RLlib, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) functionality for training and assessment has been added to the RFRL Gym, making it even more of a robust tool for RF spectrum simulation. This paper provides an overview of the updated RFRL Gym environment. In this work, the general framework of the tool is described relative to comparable existing resources, highlighting the significant additions and refactoring we have applied to the Gym. Afterward, results from testing various RF scenarios in the MARL environment and future additions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-student Diffusion Distillation for Better One-step Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality sample generation at the cost of a lengthy multistep inference procedure. To overcome this, diffusion distillation techniques produce student generators capable of matching or surpassing the teacher in a single step. However, the student model's inference speed is limited by the size of the teacher architecture, preventing real-time generation for computationally heavy applications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Student Distillation (MSD), a framework to distill a conditional teacher diffusion model into multiple single-step generators. Each student generator is responsible for a subset of the conditioning data, thereby obtaining higher generation quality for the same capacity. MSD trains multiple distilled students, allowing smaller sizes and, therefore, faster inference. Also, MSD offers a lightweight quality boost over single-student distillation with the same architecture. We demonstrate MSD is effective by training multiple same-sized or smaller students on single-step distillation using distribution matching and adversarial distillation techniques. With smaller students, MSD gets competitive results with faster inference for single-step generation. Using 4 same-sized students, MSD significantly outperforms single-student baseline counterparts and achieves remarkable FID scores for one-step image generation: 1.20 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.20 on zero-shot COCO2014.</description>

      <title>Trustful LLMs: Customizing and Grounding Text Generation with Knowledge Bases and Dual Decoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although people are impressed by the content generation skills of large language models, the use of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, is limited by the domain grounding of the content. The correctness and groundedness of the generated content need to be based on a verified context, such as results from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). One important issue when adapting LLMs to a customized domain is that the generated responses are often incomplete, or the additions are not verified and may even be hallucinated. Prior studies on hallucination detection have focused on evaluation metrics, which are not easily adaptable to dynamic domains and can be vulnerable to attacks like jail-breaking. In this work, we propose 1) a post-processing algorithm that leverages knowledge triplets in RAG context to correct hallucinations and 2) a dual-decoder model that fuses RAG context to guide the generation process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdamW has been the default optimizer for transformer pretraining. For many years, our community searches for faster and more stable optimizers with only constraint positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{single-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename Cautious Optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing speed-up on Llama and MAE pretraining up to $1.47\times$.

      <title>BayLing 2: A Multilingual Large Language Model with Efficient Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), with their powerful generative capabilities and vast knowledge, empower various tasks in everyday life. However, these abilities are primarily concentrated in high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with weaker generative capabilities and relatively limited knowledge. Enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs is therefore crucial for serving over 100 linguistic communities worldwide. An intuitive approach to enhance the multilingual capabilities would be to construct instruction data for various languages, but constructing instruction data for over 100 languages is prohibitively costly. In this paper, we introduce BayLing 2, which efficiently transfers generative capabilities and knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages through language alignment. To achieve this, we constructed a dataset of 3.2 million instructions, comprising high-resource language instructions (Chinese and English) and cross-lingual instructions for 100+ languages and performed instruction tuning based on the dataset to facilitate the capability transfer between languages. Using Llama as the foundation model, we developed BayLing-2-7B, BayLing-2-13B, and BayLing-2-8B, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of BayLing. For multilingual translation across 100+ languages, BayLing shows superior performance compared to open-source models of similar scale. For multilingual knowledge and understanding benchmarks, BayLing achieves significant improvements across over 20 low-resource languages, demonstrating its capability of effective knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages. Furthermore, results on English benchmarks indicate that BayLing maintains high performance in highresource languages while enhancing the performance in low-resource languages. Demo, homepage, code and models of BayLing are available.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Evaluation of Text-to-Video Models using Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-video models such as Sora, Gen-3, MovieGen, and CogVideoX are pushing the boundaries of synthetic video generation, with adoption seen in fields like robotics, autonomous driving, and entertainment. As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>LoBAM: LoRA-Based Backdoor Attack on Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model merging is an emerging technique that integrates multiple models fine-tuned on different tasks to create a versatile model that excels in multiple domains. This scheme, in the meantime, may open up backdoor attack opportunities where one single malicious model can jeopardize the integrity of the merged model. Existing works try to demonstrate the risk of such attacks by assuming substantial computational resources, focusing on cases where the attacker can fully fine-tune the pre-trained model. Such an assumption, however, may not be feasible given the increasing size of machine learning models. In practice where resources are limited and the attacker can only employ techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to produce the malicious model, it remains unclear whether the attack can still work and pose threats. In this work, we first identify that the attack efficacy is significantly diminished when using LoRA for fine-tuning. Then, we propose LoBAM, a method that yields high attack success rate with minimal training resources. The key idea of LoBAM is to amplify the malicious weights in an intelligent way that effectively enhances the attack efficacy. We demonstrate that our design can lead to improved attack success rate through both theoretical proof and extensive empirical experiments across various model merging scenarios. Moreover, we show that our method has strong stealthiness and is difficult to detect.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Proximal Policy Optimization Learning Using Task Prediction for Solving Environments with Delayed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of delayed rewards in reinforcement learning (RL). While Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as a leading Policy Gradient method, its performance can degrade under delayed rewards. We introduce two key enhancements to PPO: a hybrid policy architecture that combines an offline policy (trained on expert demonstrations) with an online PPO policy, and a reward shaping mechanism using Time Window Temporal Logic (TWTL). The hybrid architecture leverages offline data throughout training while maintaining PPO's theoretical guarantees. Building on the monotonic improvement framework of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), we prove that our approach ensures improvement over both the offline policy and previous iterations, with a bounded performance gap of $(2\varsigma\gamma\alpha^2)/(1-\gamma)^2$, where $\alpha$ is the mixing parameter, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $\varsigma$ bounds the expected advantage. Additionally, we prove that our TWTL-based reward shaping preserves the optimal policy of the original problem. TWTL enables formal translation of temporal objectives into immediate feedback signals that guide learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on an inverted pendulum and a lunar lander environments, showing improvements in both learning speed and final performance compared to standard PPO and offline-only approaches.</description>

      <title>LLM-ABBA: Understanding time series via symbolic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) for time series has been demonstrated in previous work. Utilizing a symbolic time series representation, one can efficiently bridge the gap between LLMs and time series. However, the remaining challenge is to exploit the semantic information hidden in time series by using symbols or existing tokens of LLMs, while aligning the embedding space of LLMs according to the hidden information of time series. The symbolic time series approximation (STSA) method called adaptive Brownian bridge-based symbolic aggregation (ABBA) shows outstanding efficacy in preserving salient time series features by modeling time series patterns in terms of amplitude and period while using existing tokens of LLMs.
  In this paper, we introduce a method, called LLM-ABBA, that integrates ABBA into large language models for various downstream time series tasks. By symbolizing time series, LLM-ABBA compares favorably to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) in UCR and three medical time series classification tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed-polygonal chain trick in ABBA is introduced to \kc{avoid obvious drifting} during prediction tasks by significantly mitigating the effects of cumulative error arising from misused symbols during the transition from symbols to numerical values. In time series regression tasks, LLM-ABBA achieves the new SOTA on Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER) benchmarks. LLM-ABBA also shows competitive prediction capability compared to recent SOTA time series prediction results. We believe this framework can also seamlessly extend to other time series tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short Correspondence critiques the classic dichotomization of prediction error into reducible and irreducible components, noting that certain types of error can be eliminated at differential speeds. We propose an improved analytical framework that better distinguishes epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, emphasizing that predictability depends on information sets and cautioning against premature claims of unpredictability.</description>

      <title>Density-Calibrated Conformal Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Density-Calibrated Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR-d) method, a novel approach for constructing prediction intervals that adapts to varying uncertainty across the feature space. Building upon conformal quantile regression, CQR-d incorporates local information through a weighted combination of local and global conformity scores, where the weights are determined by local data density. We prove that CQR-d provides valid marginal coverage at level $1 - \alpha - \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ represents a small tolerance from numerical optimization. Through extensive simulation studies and an application to the a heteroscedastic dataset available in R, we demonstrate that CQR-d maintains the desired coverage while producing substantially narrower prediction intervals compared to standard conformal quantile regression (CQR). The method's effectiveness is particularly pronounced in settings with clear local uncertainty patterns, making it a valuable tool for prediction tasks in heterogeneous data environments.</description>

      <title>TransFair: Transferring Fairness from Ocular Disease Classification to Progression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in automated disease classification significantly reduces healthcare costs and improves the accessibility of services. However, this transformation has given rise to concerns about the fairness of AI, which disproportionately affects certain groups, particularly patients from underprivileged populations. Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities. Although these methods have shown effectiveness in disease classification tasks, they may fall short in ensuring fair prediction of disease progression, mainly because of limited longitudinal data with diverse demographics available for training a robust and equitable prediction model. In this paper, we introduce TransFair to enhance demographic fairness in progression prediction for ocular diseases. TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with models with and without considering fairness learning show that TransFair effectively enhances demographic equity in predicting ocular disease progression.</description>

      <title>VISION-XL: High Definition Video Inverse Problem Solver using Latent Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for solving high-definition video inverse problems using latent image diffusion models. Building on recent advancements in spatio-temporal optimization for video inverse problems using image diffusion models, our approach leverages latent-space diffusion models to achieve enhanced video quality and resolution. To address the high computational demands of processing high-resolution frames, we introduce a pseudo-batch consistent sampling strategy, allowing efficient operation on a single GPU. Additionally, to improve temporal consistency, we present batch-consistent inversion, an initialization technique that incorporates informative latents from the measurement frame. By integrating with SDXL, our framework achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction across a wide range of spatio-temporal inverse problems, including complex combinations of frame averaging and various spatial degradations, such as deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting. Unlike previous methods, our approach supports multiple aspect ratios (landscape, vertical, and square) and delivers HD-resolution reconstructions (exceeding 1280x720) in under 2.5 minutes on a single NVIDIA 4090 GPU.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Vision-language Context Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

      <title>Advancing Speech Language Models by Scaling Supervised Fine-Tuning with Over 60,000 Hours of Synthetic Speech Dialogue Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GPT-4o represents a significant milestone in enabling real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, its remarkable low latency and high fluency not only capture attention but also stimulate research interest in the field. This real-time speech interaction is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid feedback and immediate responses, dramatically enhancing user experience. However, there is a notable lack of research focused on real-time large speech language models, particularly for Chinese. In this work, we present KE-Omni, a seamless large speech language model built upon Ke-SpeechChat, a large-scale high-quality synthetic speech interaction dataset consisting of 7 million Chinese and English conversations, featuring 42,002 speakers, and totaling over 60,000 hours, This contributes significantly to the advancement of research and development in this field. The demos can be accessed at \url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/KE-Team/KE-Omni}.</description>

      <title>InstantSwap: Fast Customized Concept Swapping across Sharp Shape Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Customized Concept Swapping (CCS) enable a text-to-image model to swap a concept in the source image with a customized target concept. However, the existing methods still face the challenges of inconsistency and inefficiency. They struggle to maintain consistency in both the foreground and background during concept swapping, especially when the shape difference is large between objects. Additionally, they either require time-consuming training processes or involve redundant calculations during inference. To tackle these issues, we introduce InstantSwap, a new CCS method that aims to handle sharp shape disparity at speed. Specifically, we first extract the bbox of the object in the source image automatically based on attention map analysis and leverage the bbox to achieve both foreground and background consistency. For background consistency, we remove the gradient outside the bbox during the swapping process so that the background is free from being modified. For foreground consistency, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to inject semantic information into both source and target concepts inside the box. This helps learn semantic-enhanced representations that encourage the swapping process to focus on the foreground objects. To improve swapping speed, we avoid computing gradients at each timestep but instead calculate them periodically to reduce the number of forward passes, which improves efficiency a lot with a little sacrifice on performance. Finally, we establish a benchmark dataset to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority and versatility of InstantSwap.

      <title>Yi-Lightning Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents Yi-Lightning, our latest flagship large language model (LLM). It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences. This observation prompts a critical reassessment of conventional benchmarks' utility in guiding the development of more intelligent and powerful AI systems for practical applications. Yi-Lightning is now available through our developer platform at https://platform.lingyiwanwu.com.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Lingual Audio Abuse Detection in Low-Resource Settings with Few-Shot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online abusive content detection, particularly in low-resource settings and within the audio modality, remains underexplored. We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.</description>

      <title>Understanding complex crowd dynamics with generative neural simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is an outstanding challenge crucial for designing efficient urban infrastructure and ensuring safe crowd management. To this end, both small-scale laboratory and large-scale real-world measurements have been used. However, these approaches respectively lack statistical resolution and parametric controllability, both essential to discovering physical relationships underlying the complex stochastic dynamics of crowds. Here, we establish an investigation paradigm that offers laboratory-like controllability, while ensuring the statistical resolution of large-scale real-world datasets. Using our data-driven Neural Crowd Simulator (NeCS), which we train on large-scale data and validate against key statistical features of crowd dynamics, we show that we can perform effective surrogate crowd dynamics experiments without training on specific scenarios. We not only reproduce known experimental results on pairwise avoidance, but also uncover the vision-guided and topological nature of N-body interactions. These findings show how virtual experiments based on neural simulation enable data-driven scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning via Homomorphic Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) aims to train a global model for multiple clients while maintaining their data privacy. However, current PPFL protocols exhibit one or more of the following insufficiencies: considerable degradation in accuracy, the requirement for sharing keys, and cooperation during the key generation or decryption processes. As a mitigation, we develop the first protocol that utilizes neural networks to implement PPFL, as well as incorporating an Aggregatable Hybrid Encryption scheme tailored to the needs of PPFL. We name these networks as Homomorphic Adversarial Networks (HANs) which demonstrate that neural networks are capable of performing tasks similar to multi-key homomorphic encryption (MK-HE) while solving the problems of key distribution and collaborative decryption. Our experiments show that HANs are robust against privacy attacks. Compared with non-private federated learning, experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that HANs exhibit a negligible accuracy loss (at most 1.35%). Compared to traditional MK-HE schemes, HANs increase encryption aggregation speed by 6,075 times while incurring a 29.2 times increase in communication overhead.</description>
