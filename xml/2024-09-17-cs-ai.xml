      <title>Bayesian Inverse Graphics for Few-Shot Concept Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at building generalizations of new concepts from just one single example. Contrary to this, current computer vision models typically require large amount of training samples to achieve a comparable accuracy. In this work we present a Bayesian model of perception that learns using only minimal data, a prototypical probabilistic program of an object. Specifically, we propose a generative inverse graphics model of primitive shapes, to infer posterior distributions over physically consistent parameters from one or several images. We show how this representation can be used for downstream tasks such as few-shot classification and pose estimation. Our model outperforms existing few-shot neural-only classification algorithms and demonstrates generalization across varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and out-of-distribution shapes. By design, our model is uncertainty-aware and uses our new differentiable renderer for optimizing global scene parameters through gradient descent, sampling posterior distributions over object parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and using a neural based likelihood function.</description>

      <title>Inter Observer Variability Assessment through Ordered Weighted Belief Divergence Measure in MAGDM Application to the Ensemble Classifier Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large number of multi-attribute group decisionmaking (MAGDM) have been widely introduced to obtain consensus results. However, most of the methodologies ignore the conflict among the experts opinions and only consider equal or variable priorities of them. Therefore, this study aims to propose an Evidential MAGDM method by assessing the inter-observational variability and handling uncertainty that emerges between the experts. The proposed framework has fourfold contributions. First, the basic probability assignment (BPA) generation method is introduced to consider the inherent characteristics of each alternative by computing the degree of belief. Second, the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure is constructed to capture the overall intrinsic information of the alternative by assessing the inter-observational variability and addressing the conflicts emerging between the group of experts. An ordered weighted belief divergence measure is constructed to acquire the weighted support for each group of experts to obtain the final preference relationship. Finally, we have shown an illustrative example of the proposed Evidential MAGDM framework. Further, we have analyzed the interpretation of Evidential MAGDM in the real-world application for ensemble classifier feature fusion to diagnose retinal disorders using optical coherence tomography images.</description>

      <title>Explaining Datasets in Words: Statistical Models with Natural Language Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate "discusses COVID". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce.</description>

      <title>Developing an Algorithm Selector for Green Configuration in Scheduling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is central to operations research, primarily optimizing energy efficiency due to its profound environmental and economic implications. Efficient scheduling enhances production metrics and mitigates energy consumption, thus effectively balancing productivity and sustainability objectives. Given the intricate and diverse nature of JSP instances, along with the array of algorithms developed to tackle these challenges, an intelligent algorithm selection tool becomes paramount. This paper introduces a framework designed to identify key problem features that characterize its complexity and guide the selection of suitable algorithms. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly XGBoost, the framework recommends optimal solvers such as GUROBI, CPLEX, and GECODE for efficient JSP scheduling. GUROBI excels with smaller instances, while GECODE demonstrates robust scalability for complex scenarios. The proposed algorithm selector achieves an accuracy of 84.51\% in recommending the best algorithm for solving new JSP instances, highlighting its efficacy in algorithm selection. By refining feature extraction methodologies, the framework aims to broaden its applicability across diverse JSP scenarios, thereby advancing efficiency and sustainability in manufacturing logistics.</description>

      <title>CPL: Critical Planning Step Learning Boosts LLM Generalization in Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training large language models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities has proven effective across diverse domains, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing methods primarily focus on improving task-specific reasoning but have not adequately addressed the model's generalization capabilities across a broader range of reasoning tasks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Critical Planning Step Learning (CPL), which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore diverse planning steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. Based on long-term outcomes, CPL learns step-level planning preferences to improve the model's planning capabilities and, consequently, its general reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, while effective in many scenarios for aligning LLMs, existing preference learning approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle with complex multi-step reasoning tasks due to their inability to capture fine-grained supervision at each step. We propose Step-level Advantage Preference Optimization (Step-APO), which integrates an advantage estimate for step-level preference pairs obtained via MCTS into the DPO. This enables the model to more effectively learn critical intermediate planning steps, thereby further improving its generalization in reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on GSM8K and MATH, not only significantly improves performance on GSM8K (+10.5%) and MATH (+6.5%), but also enhances out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks, such as ARC-C (+4.0%), BBH (+1.8%), MMLU-STEM (+2.2%), and MMLU (+0.9%).</description>

      <title>A RAG Approach for Generating Competency Questions in Ontology Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.</description>

      <title>Using The Concept Hierarchy for Household Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to systematically represent both the static and the dynamic components of environments, i.e. objects and agents, as well as the changes that are happening in the environment, i.e. the actions and skills performed by agents. Our approach, the Concept Hierarchy, provides the necessary information for autonomous systems to represent environment states, perform action modeling and recognition, and plan the execution of tasks. Additionally, the hierarchical structure supports generalization and knowledge transfer to environments. We rigorously define tasks, actions, skills, and affordances that enable human-understandable action and skill recognition.</description>

      <title>Exploring Action-Centric Representations Through the Lens of Rate-Distortion Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.</description>

      <title>Affective Computing Has Changed: The Foundation Model Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dawn of Foundation Models has on the one hand revolutionised a wide range of research problems, and, on the other hand, democratised the access and use of AI-based tools by the general public. We even observe an incursion of these models into disciplines related to human psychology, such as the Affective Computing domain, suggesting their affective, emerging capabilities. In this work, we aim to raise awareness of the power of Foundation Models in the field of Affective Computing by synthetically generating and analysing multimodal affective data, focusing on vision, linguistics, and speech (acoustics). We also discuss some fundamental problems, such as ethical issues and regulatory aspects, related to the use of Foundation Models in this research area.</description>

      <title>Yes, Prime Minister, question order does matter -- and it's certainly not classical! But is it quantum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Response to a poll can be manipulated by means of a series of leading questions. We show that such phenomena cannot be explained by use of classical probability theory, whereas quantum probability theory admits a possibility of offering an explanation. Admissible transformation rules in quantum probability, however, do impose some constraints on the modelling of cognitive behaviour, which are highlighted here. Focusing on a recent poll conducted by Ipsos on a set of questions posed by Sir Humphrey Appleby in an episode of the British political satire \textit{Yes, Prime Minister}, we show that the resulting data cannot be explained quite so simply using quantum rules, although it seems not impossible.</description>

      <title>SynSUM -- Synthetic Benchmark with Structured and Unstructured Medical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the SynSUM benchmark, a synthetic dataset linking unstructured clinical notes to structured background variables. The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation. The dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/prabaey/SynSUM.</description>

      <title>AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Pattern Matchers: Editing Semi-Structured and Structured Documents with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer numerous applications, the full extent of which is not yet understood. This paper investigates if LLMs can be applied for editing structured and semi-structured documents with minimal effort. Using a qualitative research approach, we conduct two case studies with ChatGPT and thoroughly analyze the results. Our experiments indicate that LLMs can effectively edit structured and semi-structured documents when provided with basic, straightforward prompts. ChatGPT demonstrates a strong ability to recognize and process the structure of annotated documents. This suggests that explicitly structuring tasks and data in prompts might enhance an LLM's ability to understand and solve tasks. Furthermore, the experiments also reveal impressive pattern matching skills in ChatGPT. This observation deserves further investigation, as it may contribute to understanding the processes leading to hallucinations in LLMs.</description>

      <title>StockTime: A Time Series Specialized Large Language Model Architecture for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stock price prediction task holds a significant role in the financial domain and has been studied for a long time. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have brought new ways to improve these predictions. While recent financial large language models (FinLLMs) have shown considerable progress in financial NLP tasks compared to smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs), challenges persist in stock price forecasting. Firstly, effectively integrating the modalities of time series data and natural language to fully leverage these capabilities remains complex. Secondly, FinLLMs focus more on analysis and interpretability, which can overlook the essential features of time series data. Moreover, due to the abundance of false and redundant information in financial markets, models often produce less accurate predictions when faced with such input data. In this paper, we introduce StockTime, a novel LLM-based architecture designed specifically for stock price data. Unlike recent FinLLMs, StockTime is specifically designed for stock price time series data. It leverages the natural ability of LLMs to predict the next token by treating stock prices as consecutive tokens, extracting textual information such as stock correlations, statistical trends and timestamps directly from these stock prices. StockTime then integrates both textual and time series data into the embedding space. By fusing this multimodal data, StockTime effectively predicts stock prices across arbitrary look-back periods. Our experiments demonstrate that StockTime outperforms recent LLMs, as it gives more accurate predictions while reducing memory usage and runtime costs.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are generally regarded as more energy-efficient because they do not use multiplications. However, most SNN works only consider the counting of additions to evaluate energy consumption, neglecting other overheads such as memory accesses and data movement operations. This oversight can lead to a misleading perception of efficiency, especially when state-of-the-art SNN accelerators operate with very small time window sizes. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the energy consumption of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs from a hardware perspective. We provide accurate formulas for energy consumption based on classical multi-level memory hierarchy architectures, commonly used neuromorphic dataflow architectures, and our proposed improved spatial-dataflow architecture. Our research demonstrates that to achieve comparable accuracy and greater energy efficiency than ANNs, SNNs require strict limitations on both time window size T and sparsity s. For instance, with the VGG16 model and a fixed T of 6, the neuron sparsity rate must exceed 93% to ensure energy efficiency across most architectures. Inspired by our findings, we explore strategies to enhance energy efficiency by increasing sparsity. We introduce two regularization terms during training that constrain weights and activations, effectively boosting the sparsity rate. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using T of 6, show that our SNNs consume 69% of the energy used by optimized ANNs on spatial-dataflow architectures, while maintaining an SNN accuracy of 94.18%. This framework, developed using PyTorch, is publicly available for use and further research.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, financial analysts have been trying to develop models to predict the movement of a stock price index. The task becomes challenging in vague economic, social, and political situations like in Pakistan. In this study, we employed efficient models of machine learning such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to predict the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 index by taking monthly data of twenty-six economic, social, political, and administrative indicators from February 2004 to December 2020. The comparative results of LSTM and QLSTM predicted values of the KSE 100 index with the actual values suggested QLSTM a potential technique to predict stock market trends.</description>

      <title>DiReDi: Distillation and Reverse Distillation for AIoT Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, the significant efficiency can be achieved by deploying different edge AI models in various real world scenarios while a few large models manage those edge AI models remotely from cloud servers. However, customizing edge AI models for each user's specific application or extending current models to new application scenarios remains a challenge. Inappropriate local training or fine tuning of edge AI models by users can lead to model malfunction, potentially resulting in legal issues for the manufacturer. To address aforementioned issues, this paper proposes an innovative framework called "DiReD", which involves knowledge DIstillation &amp; REverse DIstillation. In the initial step, an edge AI model is trained with presumed data and a KD process using the cloud AI model in the upper management cloud server. This edge AI model is then dispatched to edge AI devices solely for inference in the user's application scenario. When the user needs to update the edge AI model to better fit the actual scenario, the reverse distillation (RD) process is employed to extract the knowledge: the difference between user preferences and the manufacturer's presumptions from the edge AI model using the user's exclusive data. Only the extracted knowledge is reported back to the upper management cloud server to update the cloud AI model, thus protecting user privacy by not using any exclusive data. The updated cloud AI can then update the edge AI model with the extended knowledge. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed "DiReDi" framework allows the manufacturer to update the user model by learning new knowledge from the user's actual scenario with private data. The initial redundant knowledge is reduced since the retraining emphasizes user private data.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantifying and Reducing Language Mismatch Effects in Cross-Lingual Speech Anti-Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of language mismatch impact speech anti-spoofing systems, while investigations and quantification of these effects remain limited. Existing anti-spoofing datasets are mainly in English, and the high cost of acquiring multilingual datasets hinders training language-independent models. We initiate this work by evaluating top-performing speech anti-spoofing systems that are trained on English data but tested on other languages, observing notable performance declines. We propose an innovative approach - Accent-based data expansion via TTS (ACCENT), which introduces diverse linguistic knowledge to monolingual-trained models, improving their cross-lingual capabilities. We conduct experiments on a large-scale dataset consisting of over 3 million samples, including 1.8 million training samples and nearly 1.2 million testing samples across 12 languages. The language mismatch effects are preliminarily quantified and remarkably reduced over 15% by applying the proposed ACCENT. This easily implementable method shows promise for multilingual and low-resource language scenarios.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study of Competitive Market Behavior Through LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to conduct market experiments, aiming to understand their capability to comprehend competitive market dynamics. We model the behavior of market agents in a controlled experimental setting, assessing their ability to converge toward competitive equilibria. The results reveal the challenges current LLMs face in replicating the dynamic decision-making processes characteristic of human trading behavior. Unlike humans, LLMs lacked the capacity to achieve market equilibrium. The research demonstrates that while LLMs provide a valuable tool for scalable and reproducible market simulations, their current limitations necessitate further advancements to fully capture the complexities of market behavior. Future work that enhances dynamic learning capabilities and incorporates elements of behavioral economics could improve the effectiveness of LLMs in the economic domain, providing new insights into market dynamics and aiding in the refinement of economic policies.</description>

      <title>E-QUARTIC: Energy Efficient Edge Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource-Optimized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble learning is a meta-learning approach that combines the predictions of multiple learners, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness. Nevertheless, ensembling models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) result in high memory and computing overhead, preventing their deployment in embedded systems. These devices are usually equipped with small batteries that provide power supply and might include energy-harvesting modules that extract energy from the environment. In this work, we propose E-QUARTIC, a novel Energy Efficient Edge Ensembling framework to build ensembles of CNNs targeting Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based embedded systems. Our design outperforms single-instance CNN baselines and state-of-the-art edge AI solutions, improving accuracy and adapting to varying energy conditions while maintaining similar memory requirements. Then, we leverage the multi-CNN structure of the designed ensemble to implement an energy-aware model selection policy in energy-harvesting AI systems. We show that our solution outperforms the state-of-the-art by reducing system failure rate by up to 40% while ensuring higher average output qualities. Ultimately, we show that the proposed design enables concurrent on-device training and high-quality inference execution at the edge, limiting the performance and energy overheads to less than 0.04%.</description>

      <title>FedProphet: Memory-Efficient Federated Adversarial Training via Theoretic-Robustness and Low-Inconsistency Cascade Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides a strong privacy guarantee by enabling local training across edge devices without training data sharing, and Federated Adversarial Training (FAT) further enhances the robustness against adversarial examples, promoting a step toward trustworthy artificial intelligence. However, FAT requires a large model to preserve high accuracy while achieving strong robustness, and it is impractically slow when directly training with memory-constrained edge devices due to the memory-swapping latency. Moreover, existing memory-efficient FL methods suffer from poor accuracy and weak robustness in FAT because of inconsistent local and global models, i.e., objective inconsistency.
  In this paper, we propose FedProphet, a novel FAT framework that can achieve memory efficiency, adversarial robustness, and objective consistency simultaneously. FedProphet partitions the large model into small cascaded modules such that the memory-constrained devices can conduct adversarial training module-by-module. A strong convexity regularization is derived to theoretically guarantee the robustness of the whole model, and we show that the strong robustness implies low objective inconsistency in FedProphet. We also develop a training coordinator on the server of FL, with Adaptive Perturbation Adjustment for utility-robustness balance and Differentiated Module Assignment for objective inconsistency mitigation. FedProphet empirically shows a significant improvement in both accuracy and robustness compared to previous memory-efficient methods, achieving almost the same performance of end-to-end FAT with 80% memory reduction and up to 10.8x speedup in training time.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has been shown to enhance individual productivity in a guided setting. While it is also likely to transform processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Collaborative environment is characterized by a blend of origination tasks that involve building something from scratch and iteration tasks that involve refining on others' work. Whether GenAI affects these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. We study this question within the open-source development landscape, a prime example of collaborative innovation, where contributions are voluntary and unguided. Specifically, we focus on the launch of GitHub Copilot in October 2021 and leverage a natural experiment in which GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) selectively rolled out support for Python, but not for R. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that GenAI effectively augments collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased maintenance-related contributions, which are mostly iterative tasks involving building on others' work, significantly more than code-development contributions, which are mostly origination tasks involving standalone contributions. This disparity was exacerbated in active projects with extensive coding activity, raising concerns that, as GenAI models improve to accommodate richer context, the gap between origination and iterative solutions may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Prompting Strategies for Multi-Label Recognition with Partial Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been adapted for Multi-Label Recognition (MLR) with partial annotations by leveraging prompt-learning, where positive and negative prompts are learned for each class to associate their embeddings with class presence or absence in the shared vision-text feature space. While this approach improves MLR performance by relying on VLM priors, we hypothesize that learning negative prompts may be suboptimal, as the datasets used to train VLMs lack image-caption pairs explicitly focusing on class absence. To analyze the impact of positive and negative prompt learning on MLR, we introduce PositiveCoOp and NegativeCoOp, where only one prompt is learned with VLM guidance while the other is replaced by an embedding vector learned directly in the shared feature space without relying on the text encoder. Through empirical analysis, we observe that negative prompts degrade MLR performance, and learning only positive prompts, combined with learned negative embeddings (PositiveCoOp), outperforms dual prompt learning approaches. Moreover, we quantify the performance benefits that prompt-learning offers over a simple vision-features-only baseline, observing that the baseline displays strong performance comparable to dual prompt learning approach (DualCoOp), when the proportion of missing labels is low, while requiring half the training compute and 16 times fewer parameters</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach where agents can form swarms to produce high-quality responses effectively. This is accomplished by utilizing agents capable of data inference and ranking, which can be effectively implemented using LLMs as response classifiers. We assess existing approaches for trustless agent inference, define our methodology, estimate practical parameters, and model various types of malicious agent attacks. Our method leverages the collective intelligence of swarms, ensuring robust and efficient decentralized AI inference with better accuracy, security, and reliability. We show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than other trustless inference strategies reaching less than 125 ms validation latency.</description>

      <title>360PanT: Training-Free Text-Driven 360-Degree Panorama-to-Panorama Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preserving boundary continuity in the translation of 360-degree panoramas remains a significant challenge for existing text-driven image-to-image translation methods. These methods often produce visually jarring discontinuities at the translated panorama's boundaries, disrupting the immersive experience. To address this issue, we propose 360PanT, a training-free approach to text-based 360-degree panorama-to-panorama translation with boundary continuity. Our 360PanT achieves seamless translations through two key components: boundary continuity encoding and seamless tiling translation with spatial control. Firstly, the boundary continuity encoding embeds critical boundary continuity information of the input 360-degree panorama into the noisy latent representation by constructing an extended input image. Secondly, leveraging this embedded noisy latent representation and guided by a target prompt, the seamless tiling translation with spatial control enables the generation of a translated image with identical left and right halves while adhering to the extended input's structure and semantic layout. This process ensures a final translated 360-degree panorama with seamless boundary continuity. Experimental results on both real-world and synthesized datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our 360PanT in translating 360-degree panoramas.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been shown a promising direction for aligning generative models with human intent and has also been explored in recent works for alignment of diffusion generative models. In this work, we provide a rigorous treatment by formulating the task of fine-tuning diffusion models, with reward functions learned from human feedback, as an exploratory continuous-time stochastic control problem. Our key idea lies in treating the score-matching functions as controls/actions, and upon this, we develop a unified framework from a continuous-time perspective, to employ reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in terms of improving the generation quality of diffusion models. We also develop the corresponding continuous-time RL theory for policy optimization and regularization under assumptions of stochastic different equations driven environment. Experiments on the text-to-image (T2I) generation will be reported in the accompanied paper.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Tagging with Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.</description>

      <title>When Context Leads but Parametric Memory Follows in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in leveraging diverse knowledge sources. This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though a variety of methods (e.g., RL, MPC, LQR) have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control of physical systems remains an open challenge. A promising avenue would be to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping. We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems. Furthermore, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing. This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it presses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments. Moving to the experimental side, (iii) we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images. An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training. We tackle (iv) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force. Finally, we leverage these four properties and show that they enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information.</description>

      <title>An Intent Modeling and Inference Framework for Autonomous and Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An intent modelling and inference framework is presented to assist the defense planning for protecting a geo-fence against unauthorized flights. First, a novel mathematical definition for the intent of an uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) is presented. The concepts of critical waypoints and critical waypoint patterns are introduced and associated with a motion process to fully characterize an intent. This modelling framework consists of representations of a UAS mission planner, used to plan the aircraft's motion sequence, as well as a defense planner, defined to protect the geo-fence. It is applicable to autonomous, semi-autonomous, and piloted systems in 2D and 3D environments with obstacles. The framework is illustrated by defining a library of intents for a security application. Detection and tracking of the target are presumed for formulating the intent inference problem. Multiple formulations of the decision maker's objective are discussed as part of a deep-learning-based methodology. Further, a multi-modal dynamic model for characterizing the UAS flight is discussed. This is later utilized to extract features using the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter for training the intent classifier. Finally, as part of the simulation study, an attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network for intent inference is presented. The simulation experiments illustrate various aspects of the framework, including trajectory generation, radar measurement simulation, etc., in 2D and 3D environments.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content.

      <title>Exploring Information Retrieval Landscapes: An Investigation of a Novel Evaluation Techniques and Comparative Document Splitting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in information retrieval is significantly influenced by the characteristics of the documents being processed. In this study, the structured nature of textbooks, the conciseness of articles, and the narrative complexity of novels are shown to require distinct retrieval strategies. A comparative evaluation of multiple document-splitting methods reveals that the Recursive Character Splitter outperforms the Token-based Splitter in preserving contextual integrity. A novel evaluation technique is introduced, utilizing an open-source model to generate a comprehensive dataset of question-and-answer pairs, simulating realistic retrieval scenarios to enhance testing efficiency and metric reliability. The evaluation employs weighted scoring metrics, including SequenceMatcher, BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score, to assess the system's accuracy and relevance. This approach establishes a refined standard for evaluating the precision of RAG systems, with future research focusing on optimizing chunk and overlap sizes to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A BERT-Based Summarization approach for depression detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depression is a globally prevalent mental disorder with potentially severe repercussions if not addressed, especially in individuals with recurrent episodes. Prior research has shown that early intervention has the potential to mitigate or alleviate symptoms of depression. However, implementing such interventions in a real-world setting may pose considerable challenges. A promising strategy involves leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to autonomously detect depression indicators from diverse data sources. One of the most widely available and informative data sources is text, which can reveal a person's mood, thoughts, and feelings. In this context, virtual agents programmed to conduct interviews using clinically validated questionnaires, such as those found in the DAIC-WOZ dataset, offer a robust means for depression detection through linguistic analysis. Utilizing BERT-based models, which are powerful and versatile yet use fewer resources than contemporary large language models, to convert text into numerical representations significantly enhances the precision of depression diagnosis. These models adeptly capture complex semantic and syntactic nuances, improving the detection accuracy of depressive symptoms. Given the inherent limitations of these models concerning text length, our study proposes text summarization as a preprocessing technique to diminish the length and intricacies of input texts. Implementing this method within our uniquely developed framework for feature extraction and classification yielded an F1-score of 0.67 on the test set surpassing all prior benchmarks and 0.81 on the validation set exceeding most previous results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Furthermore, we have devised a depression lexicon to assess summary quality and relevance. This lexicon constitutes a valuable asset for ongoing research in depression detection.</description>

      <title>Sub-graph Based Diffusion Model for Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent a contemporary class of generative models with exceptional qualities in both synthesis and maximizing the data likelihood. These models work by traversing a forward Markov Chain where data is perturbed, followed by a reverse process where a neural network learns to undo the perturbations and recover the original data. There have been increasing efforts exploring the applications of DDPMs in the graph domain. However, most of them have focused on the generative perspective. In this paper, we aim to build a novel generative model for link prediction. In particular, we treat link prediction between a pair of nodes as a conditional likelihood estimation of its enclosing sub-graph. With a dedicated design to decompose the likelihood estimation process via the Bayesian formula, we are able to separate the estimation of sub-graph structure and its node features. Such designs allow our model to simultaneously enjoy the advantages of inductive learning and the strong generalization capability. Remarkably, comprehensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed method presents numerous advantages: (1) transferability across datasets without retraining, (2) promising generalization on limited training data, and (3) robustness against graph adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Apollo: Band-sequence Modeling for High-Quality Audio Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio restoration has become increasingly significant in modern society, not only due to the demand for high-quality auditory experiences enabled by advanced playback devices, but also because the growing capabilities of generative audio models necessitate high-fidelity audio. Typically, audio restoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damaged input, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception and distortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- and high-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies in designing a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information while accurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content. Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech enhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model designed for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit frequency band split module to model the relationships between different frequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio. Evaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistently outperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres, particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multiple instruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code for Apollo is publicly available at https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo.</description>

      <title>Integration of Mamba and Transformer -- MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state-space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>SRE-CNN: A Spatiotemporal Rotation-Equivariant CNN for Cardiac Cine MR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic MR images possess various transformation symmetries,including the rotation symmetry of local features within the image and along the temporal dimension. Utilizing these symmetries as prior knowledge can facilitate dynamic MR imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. Equivariant CNN is an effective tool to leverage the symmetry priors. However, current equivariant CNN methods fail to fully exploit these symmetry priors in dynamic MR imaging. In this work, we propose a novel framework of Spatiotemporal Rotation-Equivariant CNN (SRE-CNN), spanning from the underlying high-precision filter design to the construction of the temporal-equivariant convolutional module and imaging model, to fully harness the rotation symmetries inherent in dynamic MR images. The temporal-equivariant convolutional module enables exploitation the rotation symmetries in both spatial and temporal dimensions, while the high-precision convolutional filter, based on parametrization strategy, enhances the utilization of rotation symmetry of local features to improve the reconstruction of detailed anatomical structures. Experiments conducted on highly undersampled dynamic cardiac cine data (up to 20X) have demonstrated the superior performance of our proposed approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) play a pivotal role in boosting user satisfaction by providing personalized product suggestions in domains such as e-commerce and entertainment. This study examines the integration of multimodal data text and audio into large language models (LLMs) with the aim of enhancing recommendation performance. Traditional text and audio recommenders encounter limitations such as the cold-start problem, and recent advancements in LLMs, while promising, are computationally expensive. To address these issues, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is introduced, which enhances efficiency without compromising performance. The ATFLRec framework is proposed to integrate audio and text modalities into a multimodal recommendation system, utilizing various LoRA configurations and modality fusion techniques. Results indicate that ATFLRec outperforms baseline models, including traditional and graph neural network-based approaches, achieving higher AUC scores. Furthermore, separate fine-tuning of audio and text data with distinct LoRA modules yields optimal performance, with different pooling methods and Mel filter bank numbers significantly impacting performance. This research offers valuable insights into optimizing multimodal recommender systems and advancing the integration of diverse data modalities in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden Chain-of-Thought Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning and multi-step problem-solving through the use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, generating the full CoT process results in significantly longer output sequences, leading to increased computational costs and latency during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compress the CoT process through semantic alignment, enabling more efficient decoding while preserving the benefits of CoT reasoning. Our method introduces an auxiliary CoT model that learns to generate and compress the full thought process into a compact special token representation semantically aligned with the original CoT output. This compressed representation is then integrated into the input of the Hidden Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) model. The training process follows a two-stage procedure: First, the CoT model is optimized to generate the compressed token representations aligned with the ground-truth CoT outputs using a contrastive loss. Subsequently, with the CoT model parameters frozen, the HCoT model is fine-tuned to generate accurate subsequent predictions conditioned on the prefix instruction and the compressed CoT representations from the CoT model. Extensive experiments across three challenging domains - mathematical reasoning, agent invocation, and question answering - demonstrate that our semantic compression approach achieves competitive or improved performance compared to the full CoT baseline, while providing significant speedups of at least 1.5x in decoding time. Moreover, incorporating contrastive learning objectives further enhances the quality of the compressed representations, leading to better CoT prompting and improved task accuracy. Our work paves the way for more efficient exploitation of multi-step reasoning capabilities in LLMs across a wide range of applications.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed for feature representation learning in molecular graphs. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the expressiveness of feature representation to ensure the effectiveness of GNNs. However, a significant portion of current research primarily focuses on the structural features within individual molecules, often overlooking the structural similarity between molecules, which is a crucial aspect encapsulating rich information on the relationship between molecular properties and structural characteristics. Thus, these approaches fail to capture the rich semantic information at the molecular structure level. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{Molecular Structural Similarity Motif GNN (MSSM-GNN)}, a novel molecular graph representation learning method that can capture structural similarity information among molecules from a global perspective. In particular, we propose a specially designed graph that leverages graph kernel algorithms to represent the similarity between molecules quantitatively. Subsequently, we employ GNNs to learn feature representations from molecular graphs, aiming to enhance the accuracy of property prediction by incorporating additional molecular representation information. Finally, through a series of experiments conducted on both small-scale and large-scale molecular datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines. The codes are available at https://github.com/yaoyao-yaoyao-cell/MSSM-GNN.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Fast and Accurate Performance Models for Deep Neural Network Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is a challenging task that requires tailored hardware accelerator architectures and a clear understanding of their performance characteristics when executing the intended AI workload. To facilitate this, we present an automated generation approach for fast performance models to accurately estimate the latency of a DNN mapped onto systematically modeled and concisely described accelerator architectures. Using our accelerator architecture description method, we modeled representative DNN accelerators such as Gemmini, UltraTrail, Plasticine-derived, and a parameterizable systolic array. Together with DNN mappings for those modeled architectures, we perform a combined DNN/hardware dependency graph analysis, which enables us, in the best case, to evaluate only 154 loop kernel iterations to estimate the performance for 4.19 billion instructions achieving a significant speedup. We outperform regression and analytical models in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to simulation results, while being several magnitudes faster than an RTL simulation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios with Versatile Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based shot-domain seismic deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To streamline fast-track processing of large data volumes, we have developed a deep learning approach to deblend seismic data in the shot domain based on a practical strategy for generating high-quality training data along with a list of data conditioning techniques to improve performance of the data-driven model. We make use of unblended shot gathers acquired at the end of each sail line, to which the access requires no additional time or labor costs beyond the blended acquisition. By manually blending these data we obtain training data with good control of the ground truth and fully adapted to the given survey. Furthermore, we train a deep neural network using multi-channel inputs that include adjacent blended shot gathers as additional channels. The prediction of the blending noise is added in as a related and auxiliary task with the main task of the network being the prediction of the primary-source events. Blending noise in the ground truth is scaled down during the training and validation process due to its excessively strong amplitudes. As part of the process, the to-be-deblended shot gathers are aligned by the blending noise. Implementation on field blended-by-acquisition data demonstrates that introducing the suggested data conditioning steps can considerably reduce the leakage of primary-source events in the deep part of the blended section. The complete proposed approach performs almost as well as a conventional algorithm in the shallow section and shows great advantage in efficiency. It performs slightly worse for larger traveltimes, but still removes the blending noise efficiently.</description>

      <title>Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Denoising and Deblending of Marine Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Processing marine seismic data is computationally demanding and consists of multiple time-consuming steps. Neural network based processing can, in theory, significantly reduce processing time and has the potential to change the way seismic processing is done. In this paper we are using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to remove seismic interference noise and to deblend seismic data. To train such networks, a significant amount of computational memory is needed since a single shot gather consists of more than 106 data samples. Preliminary results are promising both for denoising and deblending. However, we also observed that the results are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio (SnR). Moving to common channel domain is a way of breaking the coherency of the noise while also reducing the input volume size. This makes it easier for the network to distinguish between signal and noise. It also increases the efficiency of the GPU memory usage by enabling better utilization of multi core processing. Deblending in common channel domain with the use of a CNN yields relatively good results and is an improvement compared to shot domain.</description>

      <title>Sybil Detection using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SYBILGAT, a novel approach to Sybil detection in social networks using Graph Attention Networks (GATs). Traditional methods for Sybil detection primarily leverage structural properties of networks; however, they tend to struggle with a large number of attack edges and are often unable to simultaneously utilize both known Sybil and honest nodes. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by dynamically assigning attention weights to different nodes during aggregations, enhancing detection performance. We conducted extensive experiments in various scenarios, including pretraining in sampled subgraphs, synthetic networks, and networks under targeted attacks. The results show that SYBILGAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly in scenarios with high attack complexity and when the number of attack edges increases. Our approach shows robust performance across different network models and sizes, even as the detection task becomes more challenging. We successfully applied the model to a real-world Twitter graph with more than 269k nodes and 6.8M edges. The flexibility and generalizability of SYBILGAT make it a promising tool to defend against Sybil attacks in online social networks with only structural information.</description>

      <title>Improving Analog Neural Network Robustness: A Noise-Agnostic Approach with Explainable Regularizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles the critical challenge of mitigating "hardware noise" in deep analog neural networks, a major obstacle in advancing analog signal processing devices. We propose a comprehensive, hardware-agnostic solution to address both correlated and uncorrelated noise affecting the activation layers of deep neural models. The novelty of our approach lies in its ability to demystify the "black box" nature of noise-resilient networks by revealing the underlying mechanisms that reduce sensitivity to noise. In doing so, we introduce a new explainable regularization framework that harnesses these mechanisms to significantly enhance noise robustness in deep neural architectures.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Data Fingerprints for Privacy-Preserving Algorithm Selection in Time Series Classification: Performance and Uncertainty Estimation on Unseen Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of algorithms is a crucial step in designing AI services for real-world time series classification use cases. Traditional methods such as neural architecture search, automated machine learning, combined algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimizations are effective but require considerable computational resources and necessitate access to all data points to run their optimizations. In this work, we introduce a novel data fingerprint that describes any time series classification dataset in a privacy-preserving manner and provides insight into the algorithm selection problem without requiring training on the (unseen) dataset. By decomposing the multi-target regression problem, only our data fingerprints are used to estimate algorithm performance and uncertainty in a scalable and adaptable manner. Our approach is evaluated on the 112 University of California riverside benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the performance of 35 state-of-the-art algorithms and providing valuable insights for effective algorithm selection in time series classification service systems, improving a naive baseline by 7.32% on average in estimating the mean performance and 15.81% in estimating the uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are typically black-boxes that remain opaque with regards to their decision mechanisms. Several works in the literature have proposed post-hoc explanation methods to alleviate this issue. This paper proposes LMAC-TD, a post-hoc explanation method that trains a decoder to produce explanations directly in the time domain. This methodology builds upon the foundation of L-MAC, Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers, a method that produces faithful and listenable explanations. We incorporate SepFormer, a popular transformer-based time-domain source separation architecture. We show through a user study that LMAC-TD significantly improves the audio quality of the produced explanations while not sacrificing from faithfulness.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods are powerful tools for various domains, including critical fields such as avionics, where certification is required to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of safety. General solutions for safety-critical systems must address three main questions: Is it suitable? What drives the system's decisions? Is it robust to errors/attacks? This is more complex in AI than in traditional methods. In this context, this paper presents a comprehensive mind map of formal AI certification in avionics. It highlights the challenges of certifying AI development with an example to emphasize the need for qualification beyond performance metrics.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints. To that end, we introduce DGPMP2-ND, a differentiable collision-free motion planner for serial N-DoF kinematics, and integrate it into an iterative, gradient-based optimization approach for generic, parameterized robot program representations. SPI-DP allows first-order optimization of planned trajectories and program parameters with respect to objectives such as cycle time or smoothness subject to e.g. collision constraints, while enabling humans to understand, modify or even certify the optimized programs. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on two practical household and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>NEST-RQ: Next Token Prediction for Speech Self-Supervised Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech self-supervised pre-training can effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks. However, previous self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for speech, such as HuBERT and BEST-RQ, focus on utilizing non-causal encoders with bidirectional context, and lack sufficient support for downstream streaming models. To address this issue, we introduce the next token prediction based speech pre-training method with random-projection quantizer (NEST-RQ). NEST-RQ employs causal encoders with only left context and uses next token prediction (NTP) as the training task. On the large-scale dataset, compared to BEST-RQ, the proposed NEST-RQ achieves comparable performance on non-streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) and better performance on streaming ASR. We also conduct analytical experiments in terms of the future context size of streaming ASR, the codebook quality of SSL and the model size of the encoder. In summary, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the NTP in speech SSL and provides empirical evidence and insights for speech SSL research.</description>

      <title>B4: Towards Optimal Assessment of Plausible Code Solutions with Plausible Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selecting the best code solution from multiple generated ones is an essential task in code generation, which can be achieved by using some reliable validators (e.g., developer-written test cases) for assistance. Since reliable test cases are not always available and can be expensive to build in practice, researchers propose to automatically generate test cases to assess code solutions. However, when both code solutions and test cases are plausible and not reliable, selecting the best solution becomes challenging. Although some heuristic strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem, they lack a strong theoretical guarantee and it is still an open question whether an optimal selection strategy exists. Our work contributes in two ways. First, we show that within a Bayesian framework, the optimal selection strategy can be defined based on the posterior probability of the observed passing states between solutions and tests. The problem of identifying the best solution is then framed as an integer programming problem. Second, we propose an efficient approach for approximating this optimal (yet uncomputable) strategy, where the approximation error is bounded by the correctness of prior knowledge. We then incorporate effective prior knowledge to tailor code generation tasks. Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that existing heuristics are limited in selecting the best solutions with plausible test cases. Our proposed approximated optimal strategy B4 significantly surpasses existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional fish farming practices often lead to inefficient feeding, resulting in environmental issues and reduced productivity. We developed an innovative system combining computer vision and IoT technologies for precise Tilapia feeding. Our solution uses real-time IoT sensors to monitor water quality parameters and computer vision algorithms to analyze fish size and count, determining optimal feed amounts. A mobile app enables remote monitoring and control. We utilized YOLOv8 for keypoint detection to measure Tilapia weight from length, achieving \textbf{94\%} precision on 3,500 annotated images. Pixel-based measurements were converted to centimeters using depth estimation for accurate feeding calculations. Our method, with data collection mirroring inference conditions, significantly improved results. Preliminary estimates suggest this approach could increase production up to 58 times compared to traditional farms. Our models, code, and dataset are open-source~\footnote{The code, dataset, and models are available upon reasonable request.</description>

      <title>DM: Dual-path Magnitude Network for General Speech Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel general speech restoration model: the Dual-path Magnitude (DM) network, designed to address multiple distortions including noise, reverberation, and bandwidth degradation effectively. The DM network employs dual parallel magnitude decoders that share parameters: one uses a masking-based algorithm for distortion removal and the other employs a mapping-based approach for speech restoration. A novel aspect of the DM network is the integration of the magnitude spectrogram output from the masking decoder into the mapping decoder through a skip connection, enhancing the overall restoration capability. This integrated approach overcomes the inherent limitations observed in previous models, as detailed in a step-by-step analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the DM network outperforms other baseline models in the comprehensive aspect of general speech restoration, achieving substantial restoration with fewer parameters.</description>

Abstract: Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online advertising and ad recommender systems. In the past decade, maximizing CTR has been the main focus of model development and solution creation. Therefore, researchers and practitioners have proposed various models and solutions to enhance the effectiveness of CTR prediction. Most of the existing literature focuses on capturing either implicit or explicit feature interactions. Although implicit interactions are successfully captured in some studies, explicit interactions present a challenge for achieving high CTR by extracting both low-order and high-order feature interactions. Unnecessary and irrelevant features may cause high computational time and low prediction performance. Furthermore, certain features may perform well with specific predictive models while underperforming with others. Also, feature distribution may fluctuate due to traffic variations. Most importantly, in live production environments, resources are limited, and the time for inference is just as crucial as training time. Because of all these reasons, feature selection is one of the most important factors in enhancing CTR prediction model performance. Simple filter-based feature selection algorithms do not perform well and they are not sufficient. An effective and efficient feature selection algorithm is needed to consistently filter the most useful features during live CTR prediction process. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm named Neighborhood Search with Heuristic-based Feature Selection (NeSHFS) to enhance CTR prediction performance while reducing dimensionality and training time costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three public datasets to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed solution.</description>

      <title>Text-To-Speech Synthesis In The Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems are traditionally trained using modest databases of studio-quality, prompted or read speech collected in benign acoustic environments such as anechoic rooms. The recent literature nonetheless shows efforts to train TTS systems using data collected in the wild. While this approach allows for the use of massive quantities of natural speech, until now, there are no common datasets. We introduce the TTS In the Wild (TITW) dataset, the result of a fully automated pipeline, in this case, applied to the VoxCeleb1 dataset commonly used for speaker recognition. We further propose two training sets. TITW-Hard is derived from the transcription, segmentation, and selection of VoxCeleb1 source data. TITW-Easy is derived from the additional application of enhancement and additional data selection based on DNSMOS. We show that a number of recent TTS models can be trained successfully using TITW-Easy, but that it remains extremely challenging to produce similar results using TITW-Hard. Both the dataset and protocols are publicly available and support the benchmarking of TTS systems trained using TITW data.</description>

      <title>Layerwise Change of Knowledge in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to explain how a deep neural network (DNN) gradually extracts new knowledge and forgets noisy features through layers in forward propagation. Up to now, although the definition of knowledge encoded by the DNN has not reached a consensus, Previous studies have derived a series of mathematical evidence to take interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN. We extend the definition of interactions and, for the first time, extract interactions encoded by intermediate layers. We quantify and track the newly emerged interactions and the forgotten interactions in each layer during the forward propagation, which shed new light on the learning behavior of DNNs. The layer-wise change of interactions also reveals the change of the generalization capacity and instability of feature representations of a DNN.</description>

      <title>Distilling Monolingual and Crosslingual Word-in-Context Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a method that distils representations of word meaning in context from a pre-trained masked language model in both monolingual and crosslingual settings. Word representations are the basis for context-aware lexical semantics and unsupervised semantic textual similarity (STS) estimation. Different from existing approaches, our method does not require human-annotated corpora nor updates of the parameters of the pre-trained model. The latter feature is appealing for practical scenarios where the off-the-shelf pre-trained model is a common asset among different applications. Specifically, our method learns to combine the outputs of different hidden layers of the pre-trained model using self-attention. Our auto-encoder based training only requires an automatically generated corpus. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we performed extensive experiments using various benchmark tasks. The results on the monolingual tasks confirmed that our representations exhibited a competitive performance compared to that of the previous study for the context-aware lexical semantic tasks and outperformed it for STS estimation. The results of the crosslingual tasks revealed that the proposed method largely improved crosslingual word representations of multilingual pre-trained models.</description>

      <title>Quasimetric Value Functions with Dense Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a generalization of reinforcement learning (RL) to parametrizable goals, goal conditioned RL (GCRL) has a broad range of applications, particularly in challenging tasks in robotics. Recent work has established that the optimal value function of GCRL $Q^\ast(s,a,g)$ has a quasimetric structure, leading to targetted neural architectures that respect such structure. However, the relevant analyses assume a sparse reward setting -- a known aggravating factor to sample complexity. We show that the key property underpinning a quasimetric, viz., the triangle inequality, is preserved under a dense reward setting as well. Contrary to earlier findings where dense rewards were shown to be detrimental to GCRL, we identify the key condition necessary for triangle inequality. Dense reward functions that satisfy this condition can only improve, never worsen, sample complexity. This opens up opportunities to train efficient neural architectures with dense rewards, compounding their benefits to sample complexity. We evaluate this proposal in 12 standard benchmark environments in GCRL featuring challenging continuous control tasks. Our empirical results confirm that training a quasimetric value function in our dense reward setting indeed outperforms training with sparse rewards.</description>

      <title>Bridging Dynamic Factor Models and Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Nowcasting GDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gross domestic product (GDP) nowcasting is crucial for policy-making as GDP growth is a key indicator of economic conditions. Dynamic factor models (DFMs) have been widely adopted by government agencies for GDP nowcasting due to their ability to handle irregular or missing macroeconomic indicators and their interpretability. However, DFMs face two main challenges: i) the lack of capturing economic uncertainties such as sudden recessions or booms, and ii) the limitation of capturing irregular dynamics from mixed-frequency data. To address these challenges, we introduce NCDENow, a novel GDP nowcasting framework that integrates neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) with DFMs. This integration effectively handles the dynamics of irregular time series. NCDENow consists of 3 main modules: i) factor extraction leveraging DFM, ii) dynamic modeling using NCDE, and iii) GDP growth prediction through regression. We evaluate NCDENow against 6 baselines on 2 real-world GDP datasets from South Korea and the United Kingdom, demonstrating its enhanced predictive capability. Our empirical results favor our method, highlighting the significant potential of integrating NCDE into nowcasting models. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/sklim84/NCDENow_CIKM2024.</description>

      <title>Journalists, Emotions, and the Introduction of Generative AI Chatbots: A Large-Scale Analysis of Tweets Before and After the Launch of ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of a broader look at the impact of generative AI, this study investigated the emotional responses of journalists to the release of ChatGPT at the time of its launch. By analyzing nearly 1 million Tweets from journalists at major U.S. news outlets, we tracked changes in emotional tone and sentiment before and after the introduction of ChatGPT in November 2022. Using various computational and natural language processing techniques to measure emotional shifts in response to ChatGPT's release, we found an increase in positive emotion and a more favorable tone post-launch, suggesting initial optimism toward AI's potential. This research underscores the pivotal role of journalists as interpreters of technological innovation and disruption, highlighting how their emotional reactions may shape public narratives around emerging technologies. The study contributes to understanding the intersection of journalism, emotion, and AI, offering insights into the broader societal impact of generative AI tools.</description>

      <title>HOLA-Drone: Hypergraphic Open-ended Learning for Zero-Shot Multi-Drone Cooperative Pursuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a significant challenge in multi-agent collaboration, aiming to develop agents that can coordinate with unseen partners they have not encountered before. Recent cutting-edge ZSC methods have primarily focused on two-player video games such as OverCooked!2 and Hanabi. In this paper, we extend the scope of ZSC research to the multi-drone cooperative pursuit scenario, exploring how to construct a drone agent capable of coordinating with multiple unseen partners to capture multiple evaders. We propose a novel Hypergraphic Open-ended Learning Algorithm (HOLA-Drone) that continuously adapts the learning objective based on our hypergraphic-form game modeling, aiming to improve cooperative abilities with multiple unknown drone teammates. To empirically verify the effectiveness of HOLA-Drone, we build two different unseen drone teammate pools to evaluate their performance in coordination with various unseen partners. The experimental results demonstrate that HOLA-Drone outperforms the baseline methods in coordination with unseen drone teammates. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the feasibility of HOLA-Drone in physical systems.

      <title>What You Say = What You Want? Teaching Humans to Articulate Requirements for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompting ChatGPT to achieve complex goals (e.g., creating a customer support chatbot) often demands meticulous prompt engineering, including aspects like fluent writing and chain-of-thought techniques. While emerging prompt optimizers can automatically refine many of these aspects, we argue that clearly conveying customized requirements (e.g., how to handle diverse inputs) remains a human-centric challenge. In this work, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a study with 30 novices, we show that requirement-focused training doubles novices' prompting performance, significantly outperforming conventional prompt engineering training and prompt optimization. We also demonstrate that high-quality LLM outputs are directly tied to the quality of input requirements. Our work paves the way for more effective task delegation in human-LLM collaborative prompting.</description>

Abstract: Reading ability detection is important in modern educational field. In this paper, a method of predicting scores of reading ability is proposed, using the eye-tracking data of a few subjects (e.g., 68 subjects). The proposed method built a regression model for the score prediction by combining Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) and light-weighted neural networks. Experiments show that with few-shot learning strategy, the proposed method achieved higher accuracy than previous methods of score prediction in reading ability detection.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most common type of data in real-life scenarios. In this study, we propose a method based on the TabKANet architecture, which utilizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold network to encode numerical features and merge them with categorical features, enabling unified modeling of tabular data on the Transformer architecture. This model demonstrates outstanding performance in six widely used binary classification tasks, suggesting that TabKANet has the potential to become a standard approach for tabular modeling, surpassing traditional neural networks. Furthermore, this research reveals the significant advantages of the Kolmogorov-Arnold network in encoding numerical features.

      <description>arXiv:2409.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) significantly impacts human collaboration and communication as a crucial capability to understand others. When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team's performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent's ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results' implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for tracking a moving target in jellyfish-like swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning method for training a jellyfish-like swimmer to effectively track a moving target in a two-dimensional flow. This swimmer is a flexible object equipped with a muscle model based on torsional springs. We employ a deep Q-network (DQN) that takes the swimmer's geometry and dynamic parameters as inputs, and outputs actions which are the forces applied to the swimmer. In particular, we introduce an action regulation to mitigate the interference from complex fluid-structure interactions. The goal of these actions is to navigate the swimmer to a target point in the shortest possible time. In the DQN training, the data on the swimmer's motions are obtained from simulations conducted using the immersed boundary method. During tracking a moving target, there is an inherent delay between the application of forces and the corresponding response of the swimmer's body due to hydrodynamic interactions between the shedding vortices and the swimmer's own locomotion. Our tests demonstrate that the swimmer, with the DQN agent and action regulation, is able to dynamically adjust its course based on its instantaneous state. This work extends the application scope of machine learning in controlling flexible objects within fluid environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in processing various data structures, including graphs. While previous research has focused on developing textual encoding methods for graph representation, the emergence of multimodal LLMs presents a new frontier for graph comprehension. These advanced models, capable of processing both text and images, offer potential improvements in graph understanding by incorporating visual representations alongside traditional textual data. This study investigates the impact of graph visualisations on LLM performance across a range of benchmark tasks at node, edge, and graph levels. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of multimodal approaches against purely textual graph representations. The results provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of leveraging visual graph modalities to enhance LLMs' graph structure comprehension abilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing reasonable standards for edible chrysanthemum seedlings helps promote seedling development, thereby improving plant quality. However, current grading methods have the several issues. The limitation that only support a few indicators causes information loss, and indicators selected to evaluate seedling level have a narrow applicability. Meanwhile, some methods misuse mathematical formulas. Therefore, we propose a simple, efficient, and generic framework, SQCSEF, for establishing seedling quality classification standards with flexible clustering modules, applicable to most plant species. In this study, we introduce the state-of-the-art deep clustering algorithm CVCL, using factor analysis to divide indicators into several perspectives as inputs for the CVCL method, resulting in more reasonable clusters and ultimately a grading standard $S_{cvcl}$ for edible chrysanthemum seedlings. Through conducting extensive experiments, we validate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed SQCSEF framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is increasingly used to enhance images and videos, both intentionally and unintentionally. As AI editing tools become more integrated into smartphones, users can modify or animate photos into realistic videos. This study examines the impact of AI-altered visuals on false memories--recollections of events that didn't occur or deviate from reality. In a pre-registered study, 200 participants were divided into four conditions of 50 each. Participants viewed original images, completed a filler task, then saw stimuli corresponding to their assigned condition: unedited images, AI-edited images, AI-generated videos, or AI-generated videos of AI-edited images. AI-edited visuals significantly increased false recollections, with AI-generated videos of AI-edited images having the strongest effect (2.05x compared to control). Confidence in false memories was also highest for this condition (1.19x compared to control). We discuss potential applications in HCI, such as therapeutic memory reframing, and challenges in ethical, legal, political, and societal domains.</description>

      <title>AnyBipe: An End-to-End Framework for Training and Deploying Bipedal Robots Guided by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for robots, especially in accomplishing specific tasks, presents substantial challenges. Recent advancements have explored diverse reward function designs, training techniques, simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfers, and performance analysis methodologies, yet these still require significant human intervention. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for training and deploying RL policies, guided by Large Language Models (LLMs), and evaluates its effectiveness on bipedal robots. The framework consists of three interconnected modules: an LLM-guided reward function design module, an RL training module leveraging prior work, and a sim-to-real homomorphic evaluation module. This design significantly reduces the need for human input by utilizing only essential simulation and deployment platforms, with the option to incorporate human-engineered strategies and historical data. We detail the construction of these modules, their advantages over traditional approaches, and demonstrate the framework's capability to autonomously develop and refine controlling strategies for bipedal robot locomotion, showcasing its potential to operate independently of human intervention.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Score-based Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Multivariate Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate imputation is essential for the reliability and success of downstream tasks. Recently, diffusion models have attracted great attention in this field. However, these models neglect the latent distribution in a lower-dimensional space derived from the observed data, which limits the generative capacity of the diffusion model. Additionally, dealing with the original missing data without labels becomes particularly problematic. To address these issues, we propose the Latent Space Score-Based Diffusion Model (LSSDM) for probabilistic multivariate time series imputation. Observed values are projected onto low-dimensional latent space and coarse values of the missing data are reconstructed without knowing their ground truth values by this unsupervised learning approach. Finally, the reconstructed values are fed into a conditional diffusion model to obtain the precise imputed values of the time series. In this way, LSSDM not only possesses the power to identify the latent distribution but also seamlessly integrates the diffusion model to obtain the high-fidelity imputed values and assess the uncertainty of the dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that LSSDM achieves superior imputation performance while also providing a better explanation and uncertainty analysis of the imputation mechanism. The website of the code is \textit{https://github.com/gorgen2020/LSSDM\_imputation}.</description>

      <title>XSub: Explanation-Driven Adversarial Attack against Blackbox Classifiers via Feature Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its significant benefits in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, explainable AI (XAI) has yet to reach its full potential in real-world applications. One key challenge is that XAI can unintentionally provide adversaries with insights into black-box models, inevitably increasing their vulnerability to various attacks. In this paper, we develop a novel explanation-driven adversarial attack against black-box classifiers based on feature substitution, called XSub. The key idea of XSub is to strategically replace important features (identified via XAI) in the original sample with corresponding important features from a "golden sample" of a different label, thereby increasing the likelihood of the model misclassifying the perturbed sample. The degree of feature substitution is adjustable, allowing us to control how much of the original samples information is replaced. This flexibility effectively balances a trade-off between the attacks effectiveness and its stealthiness. XSub is also highly cost-effective in that the number of required queries to the prediction model and the explanation model in conducting the attack is in O(1). In addition, XSub can be easily extended to launch backdoor attacks in case the attacker has access to the models training data. Our evaluation demonstrates that XSub is not only effective and stealthy but also cost-effective, enabling its application across a wide range of AI models.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Generalization Guarantees for Weight Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weight normalization (WeightNorm) is widely used in practice for the training of deep neural networks and modern deep learning libraries have built-in implementations of it. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical characterizations of both optimization and generalization of deep WeightNorm models with smooth activation functions. For optimization, from the form of the Hessian of the loss, we note that a small Hessian of the predictor leads to a tractable analysis. Thus, we bound the spectral norm of the Hessian of WeightNorm networks and show its dependence on the network width and weight normalization terms--the latter being unique to networks without WeightNorm. Then, we use this bound to establish training convergence guarantees under suitable assumptions for gradient decent. For generalization, we use WeightNorm to get a uniform convergence based generalization bound, which is independent from the width and depends sublinearly on the depth. Finally, we present experimental results which illustrate how the normalization terms and other quantities of theoretical interest relate to the training of WeightNorm networks.</description>

      <title>PINNfluence: Influence Functions for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a flexible and promising application of deep learning to partial differential equations in the physical sciences. While offering strong performance and competitive inference speeds on forward and inverse problems, their black-box nature limits interpretability, particularly regarding alignment with expected physical behavior. In the present work, we explore the application of influence functions (IFs) to validate and debug PINNs post-hoc. Specifically, we apply variations of IF-based indicators to gauge the influence of different types of collocation points on the prediction of PINNs applied to a 2D Navier-Stokes fluid flow problem. Our results demonstrate how IFs can be adapted to PINNs to reveal the potential for further studies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Trust In Autonomous Vehicles: Modeling Young Adult Psychosocial Traits, Risk-Benefit Attitudes, And Driving Factors With Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low trust remains a significant barrier to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) adoption. To design trustworthy AVs, we need to better understand the individual traits, attitudes, and experiences that impact people's trust judgements. We use machine learning to understand the most important factors that contribute to young adult trust based on a comprehensive set of personal factors gathered via survey (n = 1457). Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person's mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research.</description>

Abstract: The way media reports on legal cases can significantly shape public opinion, often embedding subtle biases that influence societal views on justice and morality. Analyzing these biases requires a holistic approach that captures the emotional tone, moral framing, and specific events within the narratives. In this work we introduce E2MoCase, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the integrated analysis of emotions, moral values, and events within legal narratives and media coverage. By leveraging advanced models for emotion detection, moral value identification, and event extraction, E2MoCase offers a multi-dimensional perspective on how legal cases are portrayed in news articles.</description>

      <title>SGFormer: Single-Layer Graph Transformers with Approximation-Free Linear Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning representations on large graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature. Transformers recently have shown promising performance on small graphs thanks to its global attention for capturing all-pair interactions beyond observed structures. Existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated architectures by stacking deep attention-based propagation layers. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the necessity of adopting multi-layer attentions in Transformers on graphs, which considerably restricts the efficiency. Specifically, we analyze a generic hybrid propagation layer, comprised of all-pair attention and graph-based propagation, and show that multi-layer propagation can be reduced to one-layer propagation, with the same capability for representation learning. It suggests a new technical path for building powerful and efficient Transformers on graphs, particularly through simplifying model architectures without sacrificing expressiveness. As exemplified by this work, we propose a Simplified Single-layer Graph Transformers (SGFormer), whose main component is a single-layer global attention that scales linearly w.r.t. graph sizes and requires none of any approximation for accommodating all-pair interactions. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M, yielding orders-of-magnitude inference acceleration over peer Transformers on medium-sized graphs, and demonstrates competitiveness with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Contri(e)ve: Context + Retrieve for Scholarly Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scholarly communication is a rapid growing field containing a wealth of knowledge. However, due to its unstructured and document format, it is challenging to extract useful information from them through conventional document retrieval methods. Scholarly knowledge graphs solve this problem, by representing the documents in a semantic network, providing, hidden insights, summaries and ease of accessibility through queries. Naturally, question answering for scholarly graphs expands the accessibility to a wider audience. But some of the knowledge in this domain is still presented as unstructured text, thus requiring a hybrid solution for question answering systems. In this paper, we present a two step solution using open source Large Language Model(LLM): Llama3.1 for Scholarly-QALD dataset. Firstly, we extract the context pertaining to the question from different structured and unstructured data sources: DBLP, SemOpenAlex knowledge graphs and Wikipedia text. Secondly, we implement prompt engineering to improve the information retrieval performance of the LLM. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 40% and also observed some anomalous responses from the LLM, that are discussed in the final part of the paper.</description>

This paper presents VAE Explainer, an interactive Variational Autoencoder running in the browser to supplement existing static documentation (e.g., Keras Code Examples). VAE Explainer adds interactions to the VAE summary with interactive model inputs, latent space, and output. VAE Explainer connects the high-level understanding with the implementation: annotated code and a live computational graph.

      <title>Towards Leveraging Contrastively Pretrained Neural Audio Embeddings for Recommender Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music recommender systems frequently utilize network-based models to capture relationships between music pieces, artists, and users. Although these relationships provide valuable insights for predictions, new music pieces or artists often face the cold-start problem due to insufficient initial information. To address this, one can extract content-based information directly from the music to enhance collaborative-filtering-based methods. While previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted audio features for this purpose, we explore the use of contrastively pretrained neural audio embedding models, which offer a richer and more nuanced representation of music. Our experiments demonstrate that neural embeddings, particularly those generated with the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model, present a promising approach to enhancing music recommendation tasks within graph-based frameworks.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field. We find that many studies combining LLMs with SE have employed the concept of agents either explicitly or implicitly. However, there is a lack of an in-depth survey to sort out the development context of existing works, analyze how existing works combine the LLM-based agent technologies to optimize various tasks, and clarify the framework of LLM-based agents in SE. In this paper, we conduct the first survey of the studies on combining LLM-based agents with SE and present a framework of LLM-based agents in SE which includes three key modules: perception, memory, and action. We also summarize the current challenges in combining the two fields and propose future opportunities in response to existing challenges. We maintain a GitHub repository of the related papers at: https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/Awesome-Agent4SE.</description>

      <title>The unknotting number, hard unknot diagrams, and reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.</description>

Abstract: We propose Embodied AI as the next fundamental step in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence, juxtaposing it against current AI advancements, particularly Large Language Models. We traverse the evolution of the embodiment concept across diverse fields - philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics - to highlight how EAI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static learning. By broadening the scope of Embodied AI, we introduce a theoretical framework based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston's active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to EAI development. Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware, persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future Embodied AI research. Highlighting the importance of creating Embodied AI agents capable of seamless communication, collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest for AGI.</description>

Abstract: Dental disease is still one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States. While dental disease is preventable through healthy oral self-care behaviors (OSCB), this basic behavior is not consistently practiced. We have developed Oralytics, an online, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that optimizes the delivery of personalized intervention prompts to improve OSCB. In this paper, we offer a full overview of algorithm design decisions made using prior data, domain expertise, and experiments in a simulation test bed. The finalized RL algorithm was deployed in the Oralytics clinical trial, conducted from fall 2023 to summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Compliance Cards: Automated EU AI Act Compliance Analyses amidst a Complex AI Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the AI supply chain grows more complex, AI systems and models are increasingly likely to incorporate multiple internally- or externally-sourced components such as datasets and (pre-trained) models. In such cases, determining whether or not the aggregate AI system or model complies with the EU AI Act (AIA) requires a multi-step process in which compliance-related information about both the AI system or model and all its component parts is: (1) gathered, potentially from multiple arms-length sources; (2) harmonized, if necessary; (3) inputted into an analysis that looks across all of it to render a compliance prediction. Because this process is so complex and time-consuming, it threatens to overburden the limited compliance resources of the AI providers (i.e., developers) who bear much of the responsibility for complying with the AIA. It also renders rapid or real-time compliance analyses infeasible in many AI development scenarios where they would be beneficial to providers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a complete system for automating provider-side AIA compliance analyses amidst a complex AI supply chain. This system has two key elements. First is an interlocking set of computational, multi-stakeholder transparency artifacts that capture AIA-specific metadata about both: (1) the provider's overall AI system or model; and (2) the datasets and pre-trained models it incorporates as components. Second is an algorithm that operates across all those artifacts to render a real-time prediction about whether or not the aggregate AI system or model complies with the AIA. All told, this system promises to dramatically facilitate and democratize provider-side AIA compliance analyses (and, perhaps by extension, provider-side AIA compliance).</description>

      <title>AlphaDou: High-Performance End-to-End Doudizhu AI Integrating Bidding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence for card games has long been a popular topic in AI research. In recent years, complex card games like Mahjong and Texas Hold'em have been solved, with corresponding AI programs reaching the level of human experts. However, the game of Doudizhu presents significant challenges due to its vast state/action space and unique characteristics involving reasoning about competition and cooperation, making the game extremely difficult to solve.The RL model Douzero, trained using the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework, has shown excellent performance in Doudizhu. However, there are differences between its simplified game environment and the actual Doudizhu environment, and its performance is still a considerable distance from that of human experts. This paper modifies the Deep Monte Carlo algorithm framework by using reinforcement learning to obtain a neural network that simultaneously estimates win rates and expectations. The action space is pruned using expectations, and strategies are generated based on win rates. The modified algorithm enables the AI to perform the full range of tasks in the Doudizhu game, including bidding and cardplay. The model was trained in a actual Doudizhu environment and achieved state-of-the-art performance among publicly available models. We hope that this new framework will provide valuable insights for AI development in other bidding-based games.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Implementation Method of an Agent-Based Advanced RAG System Using Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to improve knowledge-based question-answering (QA) systems by overcoming the limitations of existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and implementing an advanced RAG system based on Graph technology to develop high-quality generative AI services. While existing RAG models demonstrate high accuracy and fluency by utilizing retrieved information, they may suffer from accuracy degradation as they generate responses using pre-loaded knowledge without reprocessing. Additionally, they cannot incorporate real-time data after the RAG configuration stage, leading to issues with contextual understanding and biased information. To address these limitations, this study implemented an enhanced RAG system utilizing Graph technology. This system is designed to efficiently search and utilize information. Specifically, it employs LangGraph to evaluate the reliability of retrieved information and synthesizes diverse data to generate more accurate and enhanced responses. Furthermore, the study provides a detailed explanation of the system's operation, key implementation steps, and examples through implementation code and validation results, thereby enhancing the understanding of advanced RAG technology. This approach offers practical guidelines for implementing advanced RAG systems in corporate services, making it a valuable resource for practical application.</description>

      <title>UlRe-NeRF: 3D Ultrasound Imaging through Neural Rendering with Ultrasound Reflection Direction Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging is a critical technology widely used in medical diagnostics. However, traditional 3D ultrasound imaging methods have limitations such as fixed resolution, low storage efficiency, and insufficient contextual connectivity, leading to poor performance in handling complex artifacts and reflection characteristics. Recently, techniques based on NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) have made significant progress in view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, but there remains a research gap in high-quality ultrasound imaging. To address these issues, we propose a new model, UlRe-NeRF, which combines implicit neural networks and explicit ultrasound volume rendering into an ultrasound neural rendering architecture. This model incorporates reflection direction parameterization and harmonic encoding, using a directional MLP module to generate view-dependent high-frequency reflection intensity estimates, and a spatial MLP module to produce the medium's physical property parameters. These parameters are used in the volume rendering process to accurately reproduce the propagation and reflection behavior of ultrasound waves in the medium. Experimental results demonstrate that the UlRe-NeRF model significantly enhances the realism and accuracy of high-fidelity ultrasound image reconstruction, especially in handling complex medium structures.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing Contextual Integrity in Privacy-Conscious Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced AI assistants combine frontier LLMs and tool access to autonomously perform complex tasks on behalf of users. While the helpfulness of such assistants can increase dramatically with access to user information including emails and documents, this raises privacy concerns about assistants sharing inappropriate information with third parties without user supervision. To steer information-sharing assistants to behave in accordance with privacy expectations, we propose to operationalize contextual integrity (CI), a framework that equates privacy with the appropriate flow of information in a given context. In particular, we design and evaluate a number of strategies to steer assistants' information-sharing actions to be CI compliant. Our evaluation is based on a novel form filling benchmark composed of human annotations of common webform applications, and it reveals that prompting frontier LLMs to perform CI-based reasoning yields strong results.</description>

      <title>MalLight: Influence-Aware Coordinated Traffic Signal Control for Traffic Signal Malfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban traffic is subject to disruptions that cause extended waiting time and safety issues at signalized intersections. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of intelligent traffic systems in the context of various disturbances, traffic signal malfunction, a common real-world occurrence with significant repercussions, has received comparatively limited attention. The primary objective of this research is to mitigate the adverse effects of traffic signal malfunction, such as traffic congestion and collision, by optimizing the control of neighboring functioning signals. To achieve this goal, this paper presents a novel traffic signal control framework (MalLight), which leverages an Influence-aware State Aggregation Module (ISAM) and an Influence-aware Reward Aggregation Module (IRAM) to achieve coordinated control of surrounding traffic signals. To the best of our knowledge, this study pioneers the application of a Reinforcement Learning(RL)-based approach to address the challenges posed by traffic signal malfunction. Empirical investigations conducted on real-world datasets substantiate the superior performance of our proposed methodology over conventional and deep learning-based alternatives in the presence of signal malfunction, with reduction of throughput alleviated by as much as 48.6$\%$.</description>

      <title>Estimating Peer Direct and Indirect Effects in Observational Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects is crucial for decision-makers in many applications, but it is particularly challenging with observational network data due to peer interactions. Many algorithms have been proposed to estimate causal effects involving network data, particularly peer effects, but they often overlook the variety of peer effects. To address this issue, we propose a general setting which considers both peer direct effects and peer indirect effects, and the effect of an individual's own treatment, and provide identification conditions of these causal effects and proofs. To estimate these causal effects, we utilize attention mechanisms to distinguish the influences of different neighbors and explore high-order neighbor effects through multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). Additionally, to control the dependency between node features and representations, we incorporate the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) into the GNN, fully utilizing the structural information of the graph, to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. Extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our theoretical findings have the potential to improve intervention strategies in networked systems, with applications in areas such as social networks and epidemiology.</description>

      <title>A Light-weight Deep Human Activity Recognition Algorithm Using Multi-knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07331v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inertial sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is the base of many human-centered mobile applications. Deep learning-based fine-grained HAR models enable accurate classification in various complex application scenarios. Nevertheless, the large storage and computational overhead of the existing fine-grained deep HAR models hinder their widespread deployment on resource-limited platforms. Inspired by the knowledge distillation's reasonable model compression and potential performance improvement capability, we design a multi-level HAR modeling pipeline called Stage-Logits-Memory Distillation (SMLDist) based on the widely-used MobileNet. By paying more attention to the frequency-related features during the distillation process, the SMLDist improves the HAR classification robustness of the students. We also propose an auto-search mechanism in the heterogeneous classifiers to improve classification performance. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that SMLDist outperforms various state-of-the-art HAR frameworks in accuracy and F1 macro score. The practical evaluation of the Jetson Xavier AGX platform shows that the SMLDist model is both energy-efficient and computation-efficient. These experiments validate the reasonable balance between the robustness and efficiency of the proposed model. The comparative experiments of knowledge distillation on six public datasets also demonstrate that the SMLDist outperforms other advanced knowledge distillation methods of students' performance, which verifies the good generalization of the SMLDist on other classification tasks, including but not limited to HAR.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotic properties of statistical estimators play a significant role both in practice and in theory. However, many asymptotic results in statistics rely heavily on the independent and identically distributed (iid) assumption, which is not realistic when we have fixed designs. In this article, we build a roadmap of general procedures for deriving asymptotic properties under fixed designs and the observations need not to be iid. We further provide their applications in many statistical applications. Finally, we apply our results to Poisson regression using a COVID-19 dataset as an illustration to demonstrate the power of these results in practice.</description>

      <title>Combining Data Generation and Active Learning for Low-Resource Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural approaches have become very popular in Question Answering (QA), however, they require a large amount of annotated data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines data augmentation via question-answer generation with Active Learning to improve performance in low-resource settings, where the target domains are diverse in terms of difficulty and similarity to the source domain. We also investigate Active Learning for question answering in different stages, overall reducing the annotation effort of humans. For this purpose, we consider target domains in realistic settings, with an extremely low amount of annotated samples but with many unlabeled documents, which we assume can be obtained with little effort. Additionally, we assume a sufficient amount of labeled data from the source domain being available. We perform extensive experiments to find the best setup for incorporating domain experts. Our findings show that our novel approach, where humans are incorporated in a data generation approach, boosts performance in the low-resource, domain-specific setting, allowing for low-labeling-effort question answering systems in new, specialized domains. They further demonstrate how human annotation affects the performance of QA depending on the stage it is performed.</description>

Abstract: Inverse Kinematics (IK) remains a dynamic field of research, with various methods striving for speed and precision. Despite advancements, many IK techniques face significant challenges, including high computational demands and the risk of generating unrealistic joint configurations. This paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of leading IK methods applied to the human leg, aiming to identify the most effective approach. We evaluate each method based on computational efficiency and its ability to produce realistic postures, while adhering to the natural range of motion and comfort zones of the joints. The findings provide insights into optimizing IK solutions for practical applications in biomechanics and animation.</description>

      <title>Kinematics and Dynamics Modeling of 7 Degrees of Freedom Human Lower Limb Using Dual Quaternions Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denavit and Hartenberg-based methods, such as Cardan, Fick, and Euler angles, describe the position and orientation of an end-effector in three-dimensional (3D) space. However, these methods have a significant drawback as they impose a well-defined rotation order, which can lead to the generation of unrealistic human postures in joint space. To address this issue, dual quaternions can be used for homogeneous transformations. Quaternions are known for their computational efficiency in representing rotations, but they cannot handle translations in 3D space. Dual numbers extend quaternions to dual quaternions, which can manage both rotations and translations. This paper exploits dual quaternion theory to provide a fast and accurate solution for the forward and inverse kinematics and the recursive Newton-Euler dynamics algorithm for a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) human lower limb in 3D space.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a series of studies have tried to extract interactions between input variables modeled by a DNN and define such interactions as concepts encoded by the DNN. However, strictly speaking, there still lacks a solid guarantee whether such interactions indeed represent meaningful concepts. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the trustworthiness of interaction concepts from four perspectives. Extensive empirical studies have verified that a well-trained DNN usually encodes sparse, transferable, and discriminative concepts, which is partially aligned with human intuition.</description>

      <title>Explaining Generalization Power of a DNN Using Interactive Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explains the generalization power of a deep neural network (DNN) from the perspective of interactions. Although there is no universally accepted definition of the concepts encoded by a DNN, the sparsity of interactions in a DNN has been proved, i.e., the output score of a DNN can be well explained by a small number of interactions between input variables. In this way, to some extent, we can consider such interactions as interactive concepts encoded by the DNN. Therefore, in this paper, we derive an analytic explanation of inconsistency of concepts of different complexities. This may shed new lights on using the generalization power of concepts to explain the generalization power of the entire DNN. Besides, we discover that the DNN with stronger generalization power usually learns simple concepts more quickly and encodes fewer complex concepts. We also discover the detouring dynamics of learning complex concepts, which explains both the high learning difficulty and the low generalization power of complex concepts. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Where We Have Arrived in Proving the Emergence of Sparse Symbolic Concepts in AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to prove the emergence of symbolic concepts (or more precisely, sparse primitive inference patterns) in well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, we prove the following three conditions for the emergence. (i) The high-order derivatives of the network output with respect to the input variables are all zero. (ii) The DNN can be used on occluded samples and when the input sample is less occluded, the DNN will yield higher confidence. (iii) The confidence of the DNN does not significantly degrade on occluded samples. These conditions are quite common, and we prove that under these conditions, the DNN will only encode a relatively small number of sparse interactions between input variables. Moreover, we can consider such interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN, because we show that inference scores of the DNN on an exponentially large number of randomly masked samples can always be well mimicked by numerical effects of just a few interactions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Neural Simulators for Stochastic Spatiotemporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are emerging as a tool for scalable data-driven simulation of high-dimensional dynamical systems, especially in settings where numerical methods are infeasible or computationally expensive. Notably, it has been shown that incorporating domain symmetries in deterministic neural simulators can substantially improve their accuracy, sample efficiency, and parameter efficiency. However, to incorporate symmetries in probabilistic neural simulators that can simulate stochastic phenomena, we need a model that produces equivariant distributions over trajectories, rather than equivariant function approximations. In this paper, we propose Equivariant Probabilistic Neural Simulation (EPNS), a framework for autoregressive probabilistic modeling of equivariant distributions over system evolutions. We use EPNS to design models for a stochastic n-body system and stochastic cellular dynamics. Our results show that EPNS considerably outperforms existing neural network-based methods for probabilistic simulation. More specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating equivariance in EPNS improves simulation quality, data efficiency, rollout stability, and uncertainty quantification. We conclude that EPNS is a promising method for efficient and effective data-driven probabilistic simulation in a diverse range of domains.</description>

      <title>RRWKV: Capturing Long-range Dependencies in RWKV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to the impressive dot-product attention, the Transformers have been the dominant architectures in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a non-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product attention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling with sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.</description>

      <title>Explainable Machine Learning for ICU Readmission Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intensive care unit (ICU) comprises a complex hospital environment, where decisions made by clinicians have a high level of risk for the patients' lives. A comprehensive care pathway must then be followed to reduce p complications. Uncertain, competing and unplanned aspects within this environment increase the difficulty in uniformly implementing the care pathway. Readmission contributes to this pathway's difficulty, occurring when patients are admitted again to the ICU in a short timeframe, resulting in high mortality rates and high resource utilisation. Several works have tried to predict readmission through patients' medical information. Although they have some level of success while predicting readmission, those works do not properly assess, characterise and understand readmission prediction. This work proposes a standardised and explainable machine learning pipeline to model patient readmission on a multicentric database (i.e., the eICU cohort with 166,355 patients, 200,859 admissions and 6,021 readmissions) while validating it on monocentric (i.e., the MIMIC IV cohort with 382,278 patients, 523,740 admissions and 5,984 readmissions) and multicentric settings. Our machine learning pipeline achieved predictive performance in terms of the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) up to 0.7 with a Random Forest classification model, yielding an overall good calibration and consistency on validation sets. From explanations provided by the constructed models, we could also derive a set of insightful conclusions, primarily on variables related to vital signs and blood tests (e.g., albumin, blood urea nitrogen and hemoglobin levels), demographics (e.g., age, and admission height and weight), and ICU-associated variables (e.g., unit type). These insights provide an invaluable source of information during clinicians' decision-making while discharging ICU patients.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Attacks for Black-box Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on argeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework MultiAttack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.</description>

      <title>RoboGPT: an intelligent agent of making embodied long-term decisions for daily instruction tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robotic agents must master common sense and long-term sequential decisions to solve daily tasks through natural language instruction. The developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing have inspired efforts to use LLMs in complex robot planning. Despite LLMs' great generalization and comprehension of instruction tasks, LLMs-generated task plans sometimes lack feasibility and correctness. To address the problem, we propose a RoboGPT agent\footnote{our code and dataset will be released soon} for making embodied long-term decisions for daily tasks, with two modules: 1) LLMs-based planning with re-plan to break the task into multiple sub-goals; 2) RoboSkill individually designed for sub-goals to learn better navigation and manipulation skills. The LLMs-based planning is enhanced with a new robotic dataset and re-plan, called RoboGPT. The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge. The proposed RoboGPT agent outperforms SOTA methods on the ALFRED daily tasks. Moreover, RoboGPT planner exceeds SOTA LLM-based planners like ChatGPT in task-planning rationality for hundreds of unseen daily tasks, and even other domain tasks, while keeping the large model's original broad application and generality.</description>

      <title>Defining and Extracting generalizable interaction primitives from DNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Faithfully summarizing the knowledge encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) into a few symbolic primitive patterns without losing much information represents a core challenge in explainable AI. To this end, Ren et al. (2024) have derived a series of theorems to prove that the inference score of a DNN can be explained as a small set of interactions between input variables. However, the lack of generalization power makes it still hard to consider such interactions as faithful primitive patterns encoded by the DNN. Therefore, given different DNNs trained for the same task, we develop a new method to extract interactions that are shared by these DNNs. Experiments show that the extracted interactions can better reflect common knowledge shared by different DNNs.</description>

      <title>Generative Ghosts: Anticipating Benefits and Risks of AI Afterlives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems quickly improve in both breadth and depth of performance, they lend themselves to creating increasingly powerful and realistic agents, including the possibility of agents modeled on specific people. We anticipate that within our lifetimes it may become common practice for people to create a custom AI agent to interact with loved ones and/or the broader world after death; indeed, the past year has seen a boom in startups purporting to offer such services. We call these "generative ghosts," since such agents will be capable of generating novel content rather than merely parroting content produced by their creator while living. In this paper, we reflect on the history of technologies for AI afterlives, including current early attempts by individual enthusiasts and by startup companies to create generative ghosts. We then introduce a novel design space detailing potential implementations of generative ghosts, and use this taxonomy to ground discussion of the practical and ethical implications of various approaches to designing generative ghosts, including potential positive and negative impacts on individuals and society. Based on these considerations, we lay out a research agenda for the AI and HCI research communities to better understand the risk/benefit landscape of this novel technology so as to ultimately empower people who wish to create and interact with AI afterlives to do so in a safe and beneficial manner.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.</description>

      <title>Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) effectively aligns pretrained Large Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs, and VLMs) with human preferences, its computational cost and complexity hamper its wider adoption. To alleviate some of the computational burden of fine-tuning, parameter efficient methods, like LoRA were introduced. In this work, we empirically evaluate the setup of Parameter Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (PE-RLHF) that leverages LoRA fine-tuning for Reward Modeling, and Reinforcement Learning. We benchmark the PE-RLHF setup on six diverse datasets spanning summarization, harmless/helpful response generation, UI automation, and visual question answering in terms of effectiveness of the trained models, and the training resources required. Our findings show, for the first time, that PE-RLHF achieves comparable performance to RLHF, while significantly reducing training time (up to 90% faster for reward models, and 30% faster for RL), and memory footprint (up to 50% reduction for reward models, and 27% for RL). We provide comprehensive ablations across LoRA ranks, and model sizes for both reward modeling and reinforcement learning. By mitigating the computational burden associated with RLHF, we push for a broader adoption of PE-RLHF as an alignment technique for LLMs and VLMs.</description>

      <title>IoTCO2: Assessing the End-To-End Carbon Footprint of Internet-of-Things-Enabled Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve privacy and ensure quality-of-service (QoS), deep learning (DL) models are increasingly deployed on Internet of Things (IoT) devices for data processing, significantly increasing the carbon footprint associated with DL on IoT, covering both operational and embodied aspects. Existing operational energy predictors often overlook quantized DL models and emerging neural processing units (NPUs), while embodied carbon footprint modeling tools neglect non-computing hardware components common in IoT devices, creating a gap in accurate carbon footprint modeling tools for IoT-enabled DL. This paper introduces \textit{\carb}, an end-to-end tool for precise carbon footprint estimation in IoT-enabled DL, with deviations as low as 5\% for operational and 3.23\% for embodied carbon footprints compared to actual measurements across various DL models. Additionally, practical applications of \carb~are showcased through multiple user case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existing methods for evaluating the inference abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been results-centric, making it difficult to assess the inference process. We introduce a new approach using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of large language models in a process-centric manner. ARC demands rigorous logical structures for problem-solving, making it a benchmark that facilitates the comparison of model inference abilities with humans. Experimental results confirm that while large language models possess weak inference abilities, they still lag in terms of logical coherence, compositionality, and productivity. Our experiments highlight the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, proposing development paths for achieving human-level reasoning.</description>

      <title>CoverUp: Coverage-Guided LLM-Based Test Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing is an essential part of software development. Test generation tools attempt to automate the otherwise labor-intensive task of test creation, but generating high-coverage tests remains a challenge. This paper proposes CoverUp, a novel approach to driving the generation of high-coverage Python regression tests. CoverUp iteratively improves test coverage, interleaving coverage analysis with dialogs with the LLM that steer it to refine tests so that they increase coverage of lines and branches. We evaluate our prototype CoverUp implementation across a benchmark of challenging code derived from open-source Python projects, and show that CoverUp substantially improves on the state of the art. Compared to CodaMosa, a hybrid search/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves a per-module median line+branch coverage of 80% (vs. 47%). Compared to MuTAP, a mutation/LLM-based test generator, CoverUp achieves an overall line+branch coverage of 90% (vs. 77%). We show that CoverUp's iterative, coverage-guided approach is crucial to its effectiveness, contributing to nearly 40% of its successes.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization finds Nash Equilibrium in Regularized General-Sum LQ Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of introducing relative entropy regularization on the Nash Equilibria (NE) of General-Sum $N$-agent games, revealing the fact that the NE of such games conform to linear Gaussian policies. Moreover, it delineates sufficient conditions, contingent upon the adequacy of entropy regularization, for the uniqueness of the NE within the game. As Policy Optimization serves as a foundational approach for Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques aimed at finding the NE, in this work we prove the linear convergence of a policy optimization algorithm which (subject to the adequacy of entropy regularization) is capable of provably attaining the NE. Furthermore, in scenarios where the entropy regularization proves insufficient, we present a $\delta$-augmentation technique, which facilitates the achievement of an $\epsilon$-NE within the game.</description>

      <title>Explaining Large Language Models Decisions with Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting possibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with potential applications in various domains, including marketing research and consumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term "token noise" effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.</description>

      <title>DELTA: Decomposed Efficient Long-Term Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a revolution across many research fields. In robotics, the integration of common-sense knowledge from LLMs into task and motion planning has drastically advanced the field by unlocking unprecedented levels of context awareness. Despite their vast collection of knowledge, large language models may generate infeasible plans due to hallucinations or missing domain information. To address these challenges and improve plan feasibility and computational efficiency, we introduce DELTA, a novel LLM-informed task planning approach. By using scene graphs as environment representations within LLMs, DELTA achieves rapid generation of precise planning problem descriptions. To enhance planning performance, DELTA decomposes long-term task goals with LLMs into an autoregressive sequence of sub-goals, enabling automated task planners to efficiently solve complex problems. In our extensive evaluation, we show that DELTA enables an efficient and fully automatic task planning pipeline, achieving higher planning success rates and significantly shorter planning times compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.</description>

      <title>Chinese Tiny LLM: Pretraining a Chinese-Centric Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04167v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce CT-LLM, a 2B large language model (LLM) that illustrates a pivotal shift towards prioritizing the Chinese language in developing LLMs. Uniquely initiated from scratch, CT-LLM diverges from the conventional methodology by primarily incorporating Chinese textual data, utilizing an extensive corpus of 1,200 billion tokens, including 800 billion Chinese tokens, 300 billion English tokens, and 100 billion code tokens. This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.</description>

Abstract: DevOps has emerged as one of the most rapidly evolving software development paradigms. With the growing concerns surrounding security in software systems, the DevSecOps paradigm has gained prominence, urging practitioners to incorporate security practices seamlessly into the DevOps workflow. However, integrating security into the DevOps workflow can impact agility and impede delivery speed. Recently, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized automation in various software domains, including software security. AI-driven security approaches, particularly those leveraging machine learning or deep learning, hold promise in automating security workflows. They reduce manual efforts, which can be integrated into DevOps to ensure uninterrupted delivery speed and align with the DevSecOps paradigm simultaneously. This paper seeks to contribute to the critical intersection of AI and DevSecOps by presenting a comprehensive landscape of AI-driven security techniques applicable to DevOps and identifying avenues for enhancing security, trust, and efficiency in software development processes. We analyzed 99 research papers spanning from 2017 to 2023. Specifically, we address two key research questions (RQs). In RQ1, we identified 12 security tasks associated with the DevSecOps process and reviewed existing AI-driven security approaches, the problems they addressed, and the 65 benchmarks used to evaluate those approaches. Drawing insights from our findings, in RQ2, we discussed state-of-the-art AI-driven security approaches, highlighted 15 challenges in existing research, and proposed 15 corresponding avenues for future opportunities.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Decision-Making under Agents with Persistent Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies algorithmic decision-making under human's strategic behavior, where a decision maker uses an algorithm to make decisions about human agents, and the latter with information about the algorithm may exert effort strategically and improve to receive favorable decisions. Unlike prior works that assume agents benefit from their efforts immediately, we consider realistic scenarios where the impacts of these efforts are persistent and agents benefit from efforts by making improvements gradually. We first develop a dynamic model to characterize persistent improvements and based on this construct a Stackelberg game to model the interplay between agents and the decision-maker. We analytically characterize the equilibrium strategies and identify conditions under which agents have incentives to improve. With the dynamics, we then study how the decision-maker can design an optimal policy to incentivize the largest improvements inside the agent population. We also extend the model to settings where 1) agents may be dishonest and game the algorithm into making favorable but erroneous decisions; 2) honest efforts are forgettable and not sufficient to guarantee persistent improvements. With the extended models, we further examine conditions under which agents prefer honest efforts over dishonest behavior and the impacts of forgettable efforts.</description>

      <title>NPGA: Neural Parametric Gaussian Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity, digital versions of human heads is an important stepping stone in the process of further integrating virtual components into our everyday lives. Constructing such avatars is a challenging research problem, due to a high demand for photo-realism and real-time rendering performance. In this work, we propose Neural Parametric Gaussian Avatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable avatars from multi-view video recordings. We build our method around 3D Gaussian splatting for its highly efficient rendering and to inherit the topological flexibility of point clouds. In contrast to previous work, we condition our avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural parametric head models (NPHM), instead of mesh-based 3DMMs. To this end, we distill the backward deformation field of our underlying NPHM into forward deformations which are compatible with rasterization-based rendering. All remaining fine-scale, expression-dependent details are learned from the multi-view videos. For increased representational capacity of our avatars, we propose per-Gaussian latent features that condition each primitives dynamic behavior. To regularize this increased dynamic expressivity, we propose Laplacian terms on the latent features and predicted dynamics. We evaluate our method on the public NeRSemble dataset, demonstrating that NPGA significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art avatars on the self-reenactment task by 2.6 PSNR. Furthermore, we demonstrate accurate animation capabilities from real-world monocular videos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic transformer-based model that converts flat, segmented facade structures into procedural definitions using a custom-designed split grammar. To facilitate this, we first develop a semi-complex split grammar tailored for architectural facades and then generate a dataset comprising of facades alongside their corresponding procedural representations. This dataset is used to train our transformer model to convert segmented, flat facades into the procedural language of our grammar. During inference, the model applies this learned transformation to new facade segmentations, providing a procedural representation that users can adjust to generate varied facade designs. This method not only automates the conversion of static facade images into dynamic, editable procedural formats but also enhances the design flexibility, allowing for easy modifications.</description>

      <title>Exclusive Style Removal for Cross Domain Novel Class Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising field in open-world learning, \textit{Novel Class Discovery} (NCD) is usually a task to cluster unseen novel classes in an unlabeled set based on the prior knowledge of labeled data within the same domain. However, the performance of existing NCD methods could be severely compromised when novel classes are sampled from a different distribution with the labeled ones. In this paper, we explore and establish the solvability of NCD in cross domain setting with the necessary condition that style information must be removed. Based on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an exclusive style removal module for extracting style information that is distinctive from the baseline features, thereby facilitating inference. Moreover, this module is easy to integrate with other NCD methods, acting as a plug-in to improve performance on novel classes with different distributions compared to the seen labeled set. Additionally, recognizing the non-negligible influence of different backbones and pre-training strategies on the performance of the NCD methods, we build a fair benchmark for future NCD research. Extensive experiments on three common datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed module.</description>

      <title>FastSpiker: Enabling Fast Training for Spiking Neural Networks on Event-based Data through Learning Rate Enhancements for Autonomous Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous embedded systems (e.g., robots) typically necessitate intelligent computation with low power/energy processing for completing their tasks. Such requirements can be fulfilled by embodied neuromorphic intelligence with spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their high learning quality (e.g., accuracy) and sparse computation. Here, the employment of event-based data is preferred to ensure seamless connectivity between input and processing parts. However, state-of-the-art SNNs still face a long training time to achieve high accuracy, thereby incurring high energy consumption and producing a high rate of carbon emission. Toward this, we propose FastSpiker, a novel methodology that enables fast SNN training on event-based data through learning rate enhancements targeting autonomous embedded systems. In FastSpiker, we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values, then select the ones that quickly offer high accuracy. Afterward, we explore different settings for the selected learning rate policies to find the appropriate policies through a statistical-based decision. Experimental results show that our FastSpiker offers up to 10.5x faster training time and up to 88.39% lower carbon emission to achieve higher or comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art on the event-based automotive dataset (i.e., NCARS). In this manner, our FastSpiker methodology paves the way for green and sustainable computing in realizing embodied neuromorphic intelligence for autonomous embedded systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-SA: Strengthen In-context Learning via Submodular Selective Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose Sub-SA (Submodular Selective Annotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose RPR (Reward and Penalty Regularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.</description>

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Model Based on Feature Disentanglement and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice to another singer's from a reference audio while keeping the original semantics. However, existing SVC methods can hardly perform zero-shot due to incomplete feature disentanglement or dependence on the speaker look-up table. We propose the first open-source high-quality zero-shot SVC model SaMoye that can convert singing to human and non-human timbre. SaMoye disentangles the singing voice's features into content, timbre, and pitch features, where we combine multiple ASR models and compress the content features to reduce timbre leaks. Besides, we enhance the timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and mixing the speaker embedding with top-3 similar speakers. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance, which comprises more than 1,815 hours of pure singing voice and 6,367 speakers. We conduct objective and subjective experiments to find that SaMoye outperforms other models in zero-shot SVC tasks even under extreme conditions like converting singing to animals' timbre. The code and weight of SaMoye are available on https://github.com/CarlWangChina/SaMoye-SVC.</description>

      <title>Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

      <title>The Cost of Arbitrariness for Individuals: Examining the Legal and Technical Challenges of Model Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model multiplicity, the phenomenon where multiple models achieve similar performance despite different underlying learned functions, introduces arbitrariness in model selection. While this arbitrariness may seem inconsequential in expectation, its impact on individuals can be severe. This paper explores various individual concerns stemming from multiplicity, including the effects of arbitrariness beyond final predictions, disparate arbitrariness for individuals belonging to protected groups, and the challenges associated with the arbitrariness of a single algorithmic system creating a monopoly across various contexts. It provides both an empirical examination of these concerns and a comprehensive analysis from the legal standpoint, addressing how these issues are perceived in the anti-discrimination law in Canada. We conclude the discussion with technical challenges in the current landscape of model multiplicity to meet legal requirements and the legal gap between current law and the implications of arbitrariness in model selection, highlighting relevant future research directions for both disciplines.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the text-to-image diffusion model has gained considerable attention from the community due to its exceptional image generation capability. A representative model, Stable Diffusion, amassed more than 10 million users within just two months of its release. This surge in popularity has facilitated studies on the robustness and safety of the model, leading to the proposal of various adversarial attack methods. Simultaneously, there has been a marked increase in research focused on defense methods to improve the robustness and safety of these models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature on adversarial attacks and defenses targeting text-to-image diffusion models. We begin with an overview of text-to-image diffusion models, followed by an introduction to a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and an in-depth review of existing attack methods. We then present a detailed analysis of current defense methods that improve model robustness and safety. Finally, we discuss ongoing challenges and explore promising future research directions. For a complete list of the adversarial attack and defense methods covered in this survey, please refer to our curated repository at https://github.com/datar001/Awesome-AD-on-T2IDM.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Assisted Virtualization of Neural Processing Units for Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud platforms today have been deploying hardware accelerators like neural processing units (NPUs) for powering machine learning (ML) inference services. To maximize the resource utilization while ensuring reasonable quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multi-tenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs for modern cloud platforms is not easy. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and ISA support for enabling fine-grained dynamic operator scheduling for virtualized NPUs.
  We present Neu10, a holistic NPU virtualization framework. We investigate virtualization techniques for NPUs across the entire software and hardware stack. Neu10 consists of (1) a flexible NPU abstraction called vNPU, which enables fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU); (2) a vNPU resource allocator that enables pay-as-you-go computing model and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings for improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness; (3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for facilitating fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We implement Neu10 based on a production-level NPU simulator. Our experiments show that Neu10 improves the throughput of ML inference services by up to 1.4$\times$ and reduces the tail latency by up to 4.6$\times$, while improving the NPU utilization by 1.2$\times$ on average, compared to state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.</description>

      <title>LLM Stability: A detailed analysis with some surprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM (large language model) practitioners commonly notice that outputs can vary for the same inputs, but we have been unable to find work that evaluates LLM stability as the main objective. In our study of 6 deterministically configured LLMs across 8 common tasks with 5 identical runs, we see accuracy variations up to 10\%. In addition, no LLM consistently delivers repeatable accuracy across all tasks. We also show examples of variation that are not normally distributed and compare configurations with zero-shot/few-shot prompting and fine-tuned examples. To better quantify what is going on, we introduce metrics focused on stability: TARr@N for the total agreement rate at N runs over raw output, and TARa@N for total agreement over parsed-out answers. We suggest that stability metrics be integrated into leader boards and research results going forward.</description>

      <title>h4rm3l: A Dynamic Benchmark of Composable Jailbreak Attacks for LLM Safety Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical concern due to a lack of adequate benchmarks for systematically evaluating their ability to resist generating harmful content. Previous efforts towards automated red teaming involve static or templated sets of illicit requests and adversarial prompts which have limited utility given jailbreak attacks' evolving and composable nature. We propose a novel dynamic benchmark of composable jailbreak attacks to move beyond static datasets and taxonomies of attacks and harms. Our approach consists of three components collectively called h4rm3l: (1) a domain-specific language that formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized prompt transformation primitives, (2) bandit-based few-shot program synthesis algorithms that generate novel attacks optimized to penetrate the safety filters of a target black box LLM, and (3) open-source automated red-teaming software employing the previous two components. We use h4rm3l to generate a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source and proprietary LLMs. Several of our synthesized attacks are more effective than previously reported ones, with Attack Success Rates exceeding 90% on SOTA closed language models such as claude-3-haiku and GPT4-o. By generating datasets of jailbreak attacks in a unified formal representation, h4rm3l enables reproducible benchmarking and automated red-teaming, contributes to understanding LLM safety limitations, and supports the development of robust defenses in an increasingly LLM-integrated world.

      <title>RT-Surv: Improving Mortality Prediction After Radiotherapy with Large Language Model Structuring of Large-Scale Unstructured Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-secure multiparty deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>

      <title>Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design \textbf{STformer} achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant \textbf{NSTformer} based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

      <title>Facial Wrinkle Segmentation for Cosmetic Dermatology: Pretraining with Texture Map-Based Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Facial wrinkle detection plays a crucial role in cosmetic dermatology. Precise manual segmentation of facial wrinkles is challenging and time-consuming, with inherent subjectivity leading to inconsistent results among graders. To address this issue, we propose two solutions. First, we build and release the first public facial wrinkle dataset, 'FFHQ-Wrinkle', an extension of the NVIDIA FFHQ dataset. It includes 1,000 images with human labels and 50,000 images with automatically generated weak labels. This dataset could serve as a foundation for the research community to develop advanced wrinkle detection algorithms. Second, we introduce a simple training strategy utilizing texture maps, applicable to various segmentation models, to detect wrinkles across the face. Our two-stage training strategy first pretrain models on a large dataset with weak labels (N=50k), or masked texture maps generated through computer vision techniques, without human intervention. We then finetune the models using human-labeled data (N=1k), which consists of manually labeled wrinkle masks. The network takes as input a combination of RGB and masked texture map of the image, comprising four channels, in finetuning. We effectively combine labels from multiple annotators to minimize subjectivity in manual labeling. Our strategies demonstrate improved segmentation performance in facial wrinkle segmentation both quantitatively and visually compared to existing pretraining methods. The dataset is available at https://github.com/labhai/ffhq-wrinkle-dataset.</description>

      <title>DOCE: Finding the Sweet Spot for Execution-Based Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a diverse set of decoding and reranking procedures have been shown effective for LLM-based code generation. However, a comprehensive framework that links and experimentally compares these methods is missing. We address this by proposing Decoding Objectives for Code Execution, a comprehensive framework that includes candidate generation, $n$-best reranking, minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding, and self-debugging as the core components. We then study the contributions of these components through execution-based evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the importance of execution-based methods and the difference gap between execution-based and execution-free methods. Furthermore, we assess the impact of filtering based on trial unit tests, a simple and effective strategy that has been often overlooked in prior works. We also propose self-debugging on multiple candidates, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on reranking for code generation. We expect our framework to provide a solid guideline for future research on code generation.</description>

      <title>A Joint Learning Model with Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programs implemented in various programming languages form the foundation of software applications. To alleviate the burden of program migration and facilitate the development of software systems, automated program translation across languages has garnered significant attention. Previous approaches primarily focus on pairwise translation paradigms, learning translation between pairs of languages using bilingual parallel data. However, parallel data is difficult to collect for some language pairs, and the distribution of program semantics across languages can shift, posing challenges for pairwise program translation. In this paper, we argue that jointly learning a unified model to translate code across multiple programming languages is superior to separately learning from bilingual parallel data. We propose Variational Interaction for Multilingual Program Translation~(VIM-PT), a disentanglement-based generative approach that jointly trains a unified model for multilingual program translation across multiple languages. VIM-PT disentangles code into language-shared and language-specific features, using variational inference and interaction information with a novel lower bound, then achieves program translation through conditional generation. VIM-PT demonstrates four advantages: 1) captures language-shared information more accurately from various implementations and improves the quality of multilingual program translation, 2) mines and leverages the capability of non-parallel data, 3) addresses the distribution shift of program semantics across languages, 4) and serves as a unified model, reducing deployment complexity.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learn Unimodal Signals with Weak Supervision for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to effectively integrate information from various sources to infer sentiment, where in many cases there are no annotations for unimodal labels. Therefore, most works rely on multimodal labels for training. However, there exists the noisy label problem for the learning of unimodal signals as multimodal annotations are not always the ideal substitutes for the unimodal ones, failing to achieve finer optimization for individual modalities. In this paper, we explore the learning of unimodal labels under the weak supervision from the annotated multimodal labels. Specifically, we propose a novel meta uni-label generation (MUG) framework to address the above problem, which leverages the available multimodal labels to learn the corresponding unimodal labels by the meta uni-label correction network (MUCN). We first design a contrastive-based projection module to bridge the gap between unimodal and multimodal representations, so as to use multimodal annotations to guide the learning of MUCN. Afterwards, we propose unimodal and multimodal denoising tasks to train MUCN with explicit supervision via a bi-level optimization strategy. We then jointly train unimodal and multimodal learning tasks to extract discriminative unimodal features for multimodal inference. Experimental results suggest that MUG outperforms competitive baselines and can learn accurate unimodal labels.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Confidential Computing on nVIDIA H100 GPU: A Performance Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report evaluates the performance impact of enabling Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) on nVIDIA H100 GPUs for large language model (LLM) inference tasks. We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 5%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Bridges for Unsupervised Musical Audio Timbre Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music timbre transfer is a challenging task that involves modifying the timbral characteristics of an audio signal while preserving its melodic structure. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on dual diffusion bridges, trained using the CocoChorales Dataset, which consists of unpaired monophonic single-instrument audio data. Each diffusion model is trained on a specific instrument with a Gaussian prior. During inference, a model is designated as the source model to map the input audio to its corresponding Gaussian prior, and another model is designated as the target model to reconstruct the target audio from this Gaussian prior, thereby facilitating timbre transfer. We compare our approach against existing unsupervised timbre transfer models such as VAEGAN and Gaussian Flow Bridges (GFB). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both better Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) and melody preservation, as reflected by lower pitch distances (DPD) compared to VAEGAN and GFB. Additionally, we discover that the noise level from the Gaussian prior, $\sigma$, can be adjusted to control the degree of melody preservation and amount of timbre transferred.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian framework for active object recognition, pose estimation and shape transfer learning through touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06912</link>

Abstract: As humans can explore and understand the world through the sense of touch, tactile sensing is also an important aspect of robotic perception. In unstructured environments, robots can encounter both known and novel objects, this calls for a method to address both known and novel objects. In this study, we combine a particle filter (PF) and Gaussian process implicit surface (GPIS) in a unified Bayesian framework. The framework can differentiate between known and novel objects, perform object recognition, estimate pose for known objects, and reconstruct shapes for unknown objects, in an active learning fashion. By grounding the selection of the GPIS prior with the maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) shape from the PF, the knowledge about known objects' shapes can be transferred to learn novel shapes. An exploration procedure with global shape estimation is proposed to guide active data acquisition and conclude the exploration when sufficient information is obtained. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is evaluated through simulations on known and novel objects, initialized with random poses. The results show that the proposed exploration procedure, utilizing global shape estimation, achieves faster exploration than a local exploration procedure based on rapidly explore random tree (RRT). Overall, our results indicate that the proposed framework is effective and efficient in object recognition, pose estimation and shape reconstruction. Moreover, we show that a learned shape can be included as a new prior and used effectively for future object recognition and pose estimation.</description>

      <title>RAGent: Retrieval-based Access Control Policy Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manually generating access control policies from an organization's high-level requirement specifications poses significant challenges. It requires laborious efforts to sift through multiple documents containing such specifications and translate their access requirements into access control policies. Also, the complexities and ambiguities of these specifications often result in errors by system administrators during the translation process, leading to data breaches. However, the automated policy generation frameworks designed to help administrators in this process are unreliable due to limitations, such as the lack of domain adaptation. Therefore, to improve the reliability of access control policy generation, we propose RAGent, a novel retrieval-based access control policy generation framework based on language models. RAGent identifies access requirements from high-level requirement specifications with an average state-of-the-art F1 score of 87.9%. Through retrieval augmented generation, RAGent then translates the identified access requirements into access control policies with an F1 score of 77.9%. Unlike existing frameworks, RAGent generates policies with complex components like purposes and conditions, in addition to subjects, actions, and resources. Moreover, RAGent automatically verifies the generated policies and iteratively refines them through a novel verification-refinement mechanism, further improving the reliability of the process by 3%, reaching the F1 score of 80.6%. We also introduce three annotated datasets for developing access control policy generation frameworks in the future, addressing the data scarcity of the domain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During multimodal model training and reasoning, data samples may miss certain modalities and lead to compromised model performance due to sensor limitations, cost constraints, privacy concerns, data loss, and temporal and spatial factors. This survey provides an overview of recent progress in Multimodal Learning with Missing Modality (MLMM), focusing on deep learning techniques. It is the first comprehensive survey that covers the historical background and the distinction between MLMM and standard multimodal learning setups, followed by a detailed analysis of current MLMM methods, applications, and datasets, concluding with a discussion about challenges and potential future directions in the field.</description>
