      <title>MixLLM: Dynamic Routing in Mixed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit potential artificial generic intelligence recently, however, their usage is costly with high response latency. Given mixed LLMs with their own strengths and weaknesses, LLM routing aims to identify the most suitable model for each query in the stream to maximize response quality and minimize cost and latency. However, the challenges involve: (1) dynamic trade-offs among quality, cost, and latency; (2) enabling continual learning in deployed systems; and (3) navigating a varying (e.g., new LLM addition or old LLM removal) set of LLM candidates over time. To bridge these gaps, we develop MixLLM, a dynamic contextual-bandit-based routing system for query-LLM assignment. Specifically, we first leverage query tags to enhance query embeddings for the routing task. Next, we design lightweight prediction models to estimate the response qualities and costs of queries over LLMs. We then devise a meta-decision maker to choose the query-LLM assignments to best tradeoff response quality, cost, and latency. Finally, the system benefits from continual training, allowing it to adapt to evolving queries and user feedback over time. Our extensive experiments show that MixLLM achieves the best trade-offs in response quality, cost, and latency (97.25% of GPT-4's quality at 24.18% of the cost under the time constraint).</description>

      <title>FactReasoner: A Probabilistic Approach to Long-Form Factuality Assessment for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated vast capabilities on generative tasks in recent years, yet they struggle with guaranteeing the factual correctness of the generated content. This makes these models unreliable in realistic situations where factually accurate responses are expected. In this paper, we propose FactReasoner, a new factuality assessor that relies on probabilistic reasoning to assess the factuality of a long-form generated response. Specifically, FactReasoner decomposes the response into atomic units, retrieves relevant contexts for them from an external knowledge source, and constructs a joint probability distribution over the atoms and contexts using probabilistic encodings of the logical relationships (entailment, contradiction) between the textual utterances corresponding to the atoms and contexts. FactReasoner then computes the posterior probability of whether atomic units in the response are supported by the retrieved contexts. Our experiments on labeled and unlabeled benchmark datasets demonstrate clearly that FactReasoner improves considerably over state-of-the-art prompt-based approaches in terms of both factual precision and recall.</description>

      <title>Scalable Best-of-N Selection for Large Language Models via Self-Certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Best-of-N selection is a key technique for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through increased test-time computation. Current state-of-the-art methods often employ computationally intensive reward models for response evaluation and selection. Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size $N$, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short. Our findings establish self-certainty as a practical and efficient way for improving LLM reasoning capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/backprop07/Self-Certainty</description>

      <title>What are Foundation Models Cooking in the Post-Soviet World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The culture of the Post-Soviet states is complex, shaped by a turbulent history that continues to influence current events. In this study, we investigate the Post-Soviet cultural food knowledge of foundation models by constructing BORSch, a multimodal dataset encompassing 1147 and 823 dishes in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, centered around the Post-Soviet region. We demonstrate that leading models struggle to correctly identify the origins of dishes from Post-Soviet nations in both text-only and multimodal Question Answering (QA), instead over-predicting countries linked to the language the question is asked in. Through analysis of pretraining data, we show that these results can be explained by misleading dish-origin co-occurrences, along with linguistic phenomena such as Russian-Ukrainian code mixing. Finally, to move beyond QA-based assessments, we test models' abilities to produce accurate visual descriptions of dishes. The weak correlation between this task and QA suggests that QA alone may be insufficient as an evaluation of cultural understanding. To foster further research, we will make BORSch publicly available at https://github.com/alavrouk/BORSch.</description>

      <title>Neurobiber: Fast and Interpretable Stylistic Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linguistic style is pivotal for understanding how texts convey meaning and fulfill communicative purposes, yet extracting detailed stylistic features at scale remains challenging. We present Neurobiber, a transformer-based system for fast, interpretable style profiling built on Biber's Multidimensional Analysis (MDA). Neurobiber predicts 96 Biber-style features from our open-source BiberPlus library (a Python toolkit that computes stylistic features and provides integrated analytics, e.g., PCA and factor analysis). Despite being up to 56 times faster than existing open source systems, Neurobiber replicates classic MDA insights on the CORE corpus and achieves competitive performance on the PAN 2020 authorship verification task without extensive retraining. Its efficient and interpretable representations readily integrate into downstream NLP pipelines, facilitating large-scale stylometric research, forensic analysis, and real-time text monitoring. All components are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Chain of Draft: Thinking Faster by Writing Less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving complex reasoning tasks through mechanisms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which emphasizes verbose, step-by-step reasoning. However, humans typically employ a more efficient strategy: drafting concise intermediate thoughts that capture only essential information. In this work, we propose Chain of Draft (CoD), a novel paradigm inspired by human cognitive processes, where LLMs generate minimalistic yet informative intermediate reasoning outputs while solving tasks. By reducing verbosity and focusing on critical insights, CoD matches or surpasses CoT in accuracy while using as little as only 7.6% of the tokens, significantly reducing cost and latency across various reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Contextual effects of sentiment deployment in human and machine translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper illustrates how the overall sentiment of a text may be shifted in translation and the implications for automated sentiment analyses, particularly those that utilize machine translation and assess findings via semantic similarity metrics. While human and machine translation will produce more lemmas that fit the expected frequency of sentiment in the target language, only machine translation will also reduce the overall semantic field of the text, particularly in regard to words with epistemic content.</description>

      <title>Steered Generation via Gradient Descent on Sparse Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode a diverse range of linguistic features within their latent representations, which can be harnessed to steer their output toward specific target characteristics. In this paper, we modify the internal structure of LLMs by training sparse autoencoders to learn a sparse representation of the query embedding, allowing precise control over the model's attention distribution. We demonstrate that manipulating this sparse representation effectively transforms the output toward different stylistic and cognitive targets. Specifically, in an educational setting, we show that the cognitive complexity of LLM-generated feedback can be systematically adjusted by modifying the encoded query representation at a specific layer. To achieve this, we guide the learned sparse embedding toward the representation of samples from the desired cognitive complexity level, using gradient-based optimization in the latent space.</description>

      <title>Single- vs. Dual-Prompt Dialogue Generation with LLMs for Job Interviews in Human Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing language models for use in conversational agents requires large quantities of example dialogues. Increasingly, these dialogues are synthetically generated by using powerful large language models (LLMs), especially in domains with challenges to obtain authentic human data. One such domain is human resources (HR). In this context, we compare two LLM-based dialogue generation methods for the use case of generating HR job interviews, and assess whether one method generates higher-quality dialogues that are more challenging to distinguish from genuine human discourse. The first method uses a single prompt to generate the complete interview dialog. The second method uses two agents that converse with each other. To evaluate dialogue quality under each method, we ask a judge LLM to determine whether AI was used for interview generation, using pairwise interview comparisons. We demonstrate that despite a sixfold increase in token cost, interviews generated with the dual-prompt method achieve a win rate up to ten times higher than those generated with the single-prompt method. This difference remains consistent regardless of whether GPT-4o or Llama 3.3 70B is used for either interview generation or judging quality.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text Classification with a Novel Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework Leveraging BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-agent collaboration framework designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of text classification models. Leveraging BERT as the primary classifier, our framework dynamically escalates low-confidence predictions to a specialized multi-agent system comprising Lexical, Contextual, Logic, Consensus, and Explainability agents. This collaborative approach allows for comprehensive analysis and consensus-driven decision-making, significantly improving classification performance across diverse text classification tasks. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves a 5.5% increase in accuracy compared to standard BERT-based classifiers, underscoring its effectiveness and academic novelty in advancing multi-agent systems within natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Finetuning of Generative Large Language Models without Reward Models and Preference Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference optimization (PO) denoted by SFT$\rightarrow$PO has become the standard for improving pretrained large language models (LLMs), with PO demonstrating significant performance gains. However, PO methods rely on either human-labeled preference data or a strong reward model to generate preference data. Can we fine-tune LLMs without preference data or reward models while achieving competitive performance to SFT$\rightarrow$PO? We address this question by introducing Discriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), a novel approach that eliminates the need for preference data. Unlike SFT, which employs a generative approach and overlooks negative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that that increases the probability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones, shifting from token prediction to data prediction. Our contributions include: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by explicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all possible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this discriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's effectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not better than SFT$\rightarrow$PO. The code can be found at https://github.com/PenGuln/DFT.</description>

      <title>MPO: An Efficient Post-Processing Framework for Mixing Diverse Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning large language models (LLMs). Yet its reliance on a singular reward model often overlooks the diversity of human preferences. Recent approaches address this limitation by leveraging multi-dimensional feedback to fine-tune corresponding reward models and train LLMs using reinforcement learning. However, the process is costly and unstable, especially given the competing and heterogeneous nature of human preferences. In this paper, we propose Mixing Preference Optimization (MPO), a post-processing framework for aggregating single-objective policies as an alternative to both multi-objective RLHF (MORLHF) and MaxMin-RLHF. MPO avoids alignment from scratch. Instead, it log-linearly combines existing policies into a unified one with the weight of each policy computed via a batch stochastic mirror descent. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO achieves balanced performance across diverse preferences, outperforming or matching existing models with significantly reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>Random Forest-of-Thoughts: Uncertainty-aware Reasoning for Computational Social Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social surveys in computational social science are well-designed by elaborate domain theories that can effectively reflect the interviewee's deep thoughts without concealing their true feelings. The candidate questionnaire options highly depend on the interviewee's previous answer, which results in the complexity of social survey analysis, the time, and the expertise required. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning is well-enhanced by prompting learning such as Chain-of-thought (CoT) but still confined to left-to-right decision-making processes or limited paths during inference. This means they can fall short in problems that require exploration and uncertainty searching. In response, a novel large language model prompting method, called Random Forest of Thoughts (RFoT), is proposed for generating uncertainty reasoning to fit the area of computational social science. The RFoT allows LLMs to perform deliberate decision-making by generating diverse thought space and randomly selecting the sub-thoughts to build the forest of thoughts. It can extend the exploration and prediction of overall performance, benefiting from the extensive research space of response. The method is applied to optimize computational social science analysis on two datasets covering a spectrum of social survey analysis problems. Our experiments show that RFoT significantly enhances language models' abilities on two novel social survey analysis problems requiring non-trivial reasoning.</description>

      <title>Automatic Prompt Optimization via Heuristic Search: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to remarkable achievements across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, making prompt engineering increasingly central to guiding model outputs. While manual methods can be effective, they typically rely on intuition and do not automatically refine prompts over time. In contrast, automatic prompt optimization employing heuristic-based search algorithms can systematically explore and improve prompts with minimal human oversight. This survey proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, categorizing them by where optimization occurs, what is optimized, what criteria drive the optimization, which operators generate new prompts, and which iterative search algorithms are applied. We further highlight specialized datasets and tools that support and accelerate automated prompt refinement. We conclude by discussing key open challenges pointing toward future opportunities for more robust and versatile LLM applications.</description>

      <title>Plutus: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Low-Resource Greek Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite Greece's pivotal role in the global economy, large language models (LLMs) remain underexplored for Greek financial context due to the linguistic complexity of Greek and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets. Previous efforts in multilingual financial natural language processing (NLP) have exposed considerable performance disparities, yet no dedicated Greek financial benchmarks or Greek-specific financial LLMs have been developed until now. To bridge this gap, we introduce Plutus-ben, the first Greek Financial Evaluation Benchmark, and Plutus-8B, the pioneering Greek Financial LLM, fine-tuned with Greek domain-specific data. Plutus-ben addresses five core financial NLP tasks in Greek: numeric and textual named entity recognition, question answering, abstractive summarization, and topic classification, thereby facilitating systematic and reproducible LLM assessments. To underpin these tasks, we present three novel, high-quality Greek financial datasets, thoroughly annotated by expert native Greek speakers, augmented by two existing resources. Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LLMs on Plutus-ben reveals that Greek financial NLP remains challenging due to linguistic complexity, domain-specific terminology, and financial reasoning gaps. These findings underscore the limitations of cross-lingual transfer, the necessity for financial expertise in Greek-trained models, and the challenges of adapting financial LLMs to Greek text. We release Plutus-ben, Plutus-8B, and all associated datasets publicly to promote reproducible research and advance Greek financial NLP, fostering broader multilingual inclusivity in finance.</description>

      <title>Active Few-Shot Learning for Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has boosted the use of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods in natural language processing, achieving acceptable performance even when working with limited training data. The goal of FSL is to effectively utilize a small number of annotated samples in the learning process. However, the performance of FSL suffers when unsuitable support samples are chosen. This problem arises due to the heavy reliance on a limited number of support samples, which hampers consistent performance improvement even when more support samples are added. To address this challenge, we propose an active learning-based instance selection mechanism that identifies effective support instances from the unlabeled pool and can work with different LLMs. Our experiments on five tasks show that our method frequently improves the performance of FSL. We make our implementation available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Forest for the Trees: A Large Scale, Continuously Updating Meta-Analysis of Frontier LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge of LLM studies makes synthesizing their findings challenging. Meta-analysis can uncover important trends across studies, but its use is limited by the time-consuming nature of manual data extraction. Our study presents a semi-automated approach for meta-analysis that accelerates data extraction using LLMs. It automatically identifies relevant arXiv papers, extracts experimental results and related attributes, and organizes them into a structured dataset. We conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of frontier LLMs using an automatically extracted dataset, reducing the effort of paper surveying and data extraction by more than 93\% compared to manual approaches. We validate our dataset by showing that it reproduces key findings from a recent manual meta-analysis about Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and also uncovers new insights that go beyond it, showing for example that in-context examples benefit multimodal tasks but offer limited gains in mathematical tasks compared to CoT. Our automatically updatable dataset enables continuous tracking of target models by extracting evaluation studies as new data becomes available. Through our scientific artifacts and empirical analysis, we provide novel insights into LLMs while facilitating ongoing meta-analyses of their behavior.</description>

      <title>Anything Goes? A Crosslinguistic Study of (Im)possible Language Learning in LMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do LLMs offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LLMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. In this paper, we test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages. Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 natural languages from 4 language families. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can primarily distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, as long as the unattested variants maintain constituency structure. These findings suggest that language models exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners.</description>

      <title>ANPMI: Assessing the True Comprehension Capabilities of LLMs for Multiple Choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-choice benchmarks, consisting of various prompts and choices, are among the most widely used methods to assess a language model's natural language understanding capability. Given a specific prompt, we typically compute $P(Choice|Prompt)$ to evaluate how likely a language model is to generate the correct choice compared to incorrect ones. However, we observe that performance measured using this approach reflects not only the model's comprehension of the prompt but also its inherent biases for certain choices regardless of the prompt. This issue makes it challenging to accurately measure a model's natural language understanding, as models may select the answer without fully understanding the prompt. To address this limitation, we propose a novel metric called ANPMI, which normalizes Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) by $-\log P(Choice)$. ANPMI provides a more accurate assessment of the model's natural language understanding by ensuring that it is challenging to answer a question without properly understanding the prompt.</description>

      <title>Language Models Grow Less Humanlike beyond Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LMs' alignment with human reading behavior (i.e. psychometric predictive power; PPP) is known to improve during pretraining up to a tipping point, beyond which it either plateaus or degrades. Various factors, such as word frequency, recency bias in attention, and context size, have been theorized to affect PPP, yet there is no current account that explains why such a tipping point exists, and how it interacts with LMs' pretraining dynamics more generally. We hypothesize that the underlying factor is a pretraining phase transition, characterized by the rapid emergence of specialized attention heads. We conduct a series of correlational and causal experiments to show that such a phase transition is responsible for the tipping point in PPP. We then show that, rather than producing attention patterns that contribute to the degradation in PPP, phase transitions alter the subsequent learning dynamics of the model, such that further training keeps damaging PPP.</description>

      <title>Judge as A Judge: Improving the Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation through the Judge-Consistency of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in alleviating hallucinations for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing automated evaluation metrics cannot fairly evaluate the outputs generated by RAG models during training and evaluation. LLM-based judgment models provide the potential to produce high-quality judgments, but they are highly sensitive to evaluation prompts, leading to inconsistencies when judging the output of RAG models. This paper introduces the Judge-Consistency (ConsJudge) method, which aims to enhance LLMs to generate more accurate evaluations for RAG models. Specifically, ConsJudge prompts LLMs to generate different judgments based on various combinations of judgment dimensions, utilize the judge-consistency to evaluate these judgments and select the accepted and rejected judgments for DPO training. Our experiments show that ConsJudge can effectively provide more accurate judgments for optimizing RAG models across various RAG models and datasets. Further analysis reveals that judgments generated by ConsJudge have a high agreement with the superior LLM. All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ConsJudge.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Driven Marker Extraction for Social Media Suicide Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of suicide risk from social media text is crucial for timely intervention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities in this domain, challenges remain in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency. This paper introduces Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), a novel approach for clinical marker extraction and suicide risk classification. ED-LLM employs a multi-task learning framework, jointly training a Mistral-7B based model to identify clinical marker spans and classify suicide risk levels. This evidence-driven strategy enhances interpretability by explicitly highlighting textual evidence supporting risk assessments. Evaluated on the CLPsych datasets, ED-LLM demonstrates competitive performance in risk classification and superior capability in clinical marker span identification compared to baselines including fine-tuned LLMs, traditional machine learning, and prompt-based methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of multi-task learning for interpretable and efficient LLM-based suicide risk assessment, paving the way for clinically relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews Using BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) or opinion mining is analysis of emotions and opinions from any kind of text. SA helps in tracking peoples viewpoints and it is an important factor when it comes to social media monitoring product and brand recognition customer satisfaction customer loyalty advertising and promotions success and product acceptance. That is why SA is one of the active research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP). SA is applied on data sourced from various media platforms to mine sentiment knowledge from them. Various approaches have been deployed in the literature to solve the problem. Most techniques devise complex and sophisticated frameworks in order to attain optimal accuracy. This work aims to finetune Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for movie reviews sentiment analysis and still provide better accuracy than the State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. The paper also shows how sentiment analysis can be applied if someone wants to recommend a certain movie for example by computing overall polarity of its sentiments predicted by the model. That is our proposed method serves as an upper-bound baseline in prediction of a predominant reaction to a movie. To compute overall polarity a heuristic algorithm is applied to BERTBiLSTM output vector. Our model can be extended to three-class four-class or any fine-grained classification and apply overall polarity computation again. This is intended to be exploited in future work.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Attention Training for Efficient Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity concerning sequence length remains a significant bottleneck for processing long documents. As a result, many efforts like sparse attention and state space models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of LLMs over long sequences. Though effective, these approaches compromise the performance or introduce structural complexity. This calls for a simple yet efficient model that preserves the fundamental Transformer architecture. To this end, we introduce SWAT, which enables efficient long-context handling via Sliding Window Attention Training. This paper first attributes the inefficiency of Transformers to the attention sink phenomenon resulting from the high variance of softmax operation. Then, we replace softmax with the sigmoid function and utilize a balanced ALiBi and Rotary Position Embedding for efficient information compression and retention. Experiments demonstrate that SWAT achieves SOTA performance compared with state-of-the-art linear recurrent architectures on eight benchmarks. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SWAT-attention.</description>

      <title>A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's internal reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, a unified evaluation framework remains absent. To address this gap, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of causal diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate a variety of faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that all tested faithfulness metrics often fail to surpass a random baseline. Our work underscores the need for improved metrics and more reliable interpretability methods in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Rewriting Approaches for Different Conversational Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational assistants often require a question rewriting algorithm that leverages a subset of past interactions to provide a more meaningful (accurate) answer to the user's question or request. However, the exact rewriting approach may often depend on the use case and application-specific tasks supported by the conversational assistant, among other constraints. In this paper, we systematically investigate two different approaches, denoted as rewriting and fusion, on two fundamentally different generation tasks, including a text-to-text generation task and a multimodal generative task that takes as input text and generates a visualization or data table that answers the user's question. Our results indicate that the specific rewriting or fusion approach highly depends on the underlying use case and generative task. In particular, we find that for a conversational question-answering assistant, the query rewriting approach performs best, whereas for a data analysis assistant that generates visualizations and data tables based on the user's conversation with the assistant, the fusion approach works best. Notably, we explore two datasets for the data analysis assistant use case, for short and long conversations, and we find that query fusion always performs better, whereas for the conversational text-based question-answering, the query rewrite approach performs best.</description>

      <title>Learning to Align Multi-Faceted Evaluation: A Unified and Robust Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more extensively for automated evaluation in various scenarios. Previous studies have attempted to fine-tune open-source LLMs to replicate the evaluation explanations and judgments of powerful proprietary models, such as GPT-4. However, these methods are largely limited to text-based analyses under predefined general criteria, resulting in reduced adaptability for unseen instructions and demonstrating instability in evaluating adherence to quantitative and structural constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework, ARJudge, that adaptively formulates evaluation criteria and synthesizes both text-based and code-driven analyses to evaluate LLM responses. ARJudge consists of two components: a fine-tuned Analyzer that generates multi-faceted evaluation analyses and a tuning-free Refiner that combines and refines all analyses to make the final judgment. We construct a Composite Analysis Corpus that integrates tasks for evaluation criteria generation alongside text-based and code-driven analysis generation to train the Analyzer. Our results demonstrate that ARJudge outperforms existing fine-tuned evaluators in effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of multi-faceted evaluation and code-driven analyses in enhancing evaluation capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the structured generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), focusing on producing valid JSON outputs against a given schema. Despite the widespread use of JSON in integrating language models with programs, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and benchmarking of these capabilities. We explore various aspects of JSON generation, such as structure understanding, escaping, and natural language description, to determine how to assess and enable LLMs to generate valid responses. Building upon this, we propose SchemaBench features around 40K different JSON schemas to obtain and assess models' abilities in generating valid JSON. We find that the latest LLMs are still struggling to generate a valid JSON string. Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating reinforcement learning with a Fine-grained Schema Validator can further enhance models' understanding of JSON schema, leading to improved performance. Our models demonstrate significant improvement in both generating JSON outputs and downstream tasks.</description>

Abstract: Recent work proposed state-space models (SSMs) as an efficient alternative to transformer-based LLMs. Can these models be pruned to further reduce their computation costs? We adapt several pruning methods to the SSM structure, and apply them to four SSM-based LLMs across multiple tasks. We find that such models are quite robust to some pruning methods (e.g. WANDA), while using other methods lead to fast performance degradation.</description>

      <title>From Hours to Minutes: Lossless Acceleration of Ultra Long Sequence Generation up to 100K Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating ultra-long sequences with large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly crucial but remains a highly time-intensive task, particularly for sequences up to 100K tokens. While traditional speculative decoding methods exist, simply extending their generation limits fails to accelerate the process and can be detrimental. Through an in-depth analysis, we identify three major challenges hindering efficient generation: frequent model reloading, dynamic key-value (KV) management and repetitive generation. To address these issues, we introduce TOKENSWIFT, a novel framework designed to substantially accelerate the generation process of ultra-long sequences while maintaining the target model's inherent quality. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKENSWIFT achieves over 3 times speedup across models of varying scales (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B) and architectures (MHA, GQA). This acceleration translates to hours of time savings for ultra-long sequence generation, establishing TOKENSWIFT as a scalable and effective solution at unprecedented lengths. Code can be found at https://github.com/bigai-nlco/TokenSwift.</description>

      <title>CS-Dialogue: A 104-Hour Dataset of Spontaneous Mandarin-English Code-Switching Dialogues for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a single conversation, presents significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.</description>

      <title>END: Early Noise Dropping for Efficient and Effective Context Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, they are often distracted by irrelevant or noisy context in input sequences that degrades output quality. This problem affects both long- and short-context scenarios, such as retrieval-augmented generation, table question-answering, and in-context learning. We reveal that LLMs can implicitly identify whether input sequences contain useful information at early layers, prior to token generation. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Early Noise Dropping (\textsc{END}), a novel approach to mitigate this issue without requiring fine-tuning the LLMs. \textsc{END} segments input sequences into chunks and employs a linear prober on the early layers of LLMs to differentiate between informative and noisy chunks. By discarding noisy chunks early in the process, \textsc{END} preserves critical information, reduces distraction, and lowers computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{END} significantly improves both performance and efficiency across different LLMs on multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, by investigating LLMs' implicit understanding to the input with the prober, this work also deepens understanding of how LLMs do reasoning with contexts internally.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Kanana, a series of bilingual language models that demonstrate exceeding performance in Korean and competitive performance in English. The computational cost of Kanana is significantly lower than that of state-of-the-art models of similar size. The report details the techniques employed during pre-training to achieve compute-efficient yet competitive models, including high quality data filtering, staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and pruning and distillation. Furthermore, the report outlines the methodologies utilized during the post-training of the Kanana models, encompassing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, aimed at enhancing their capability for seamless interaction with users. Lastly, the report elaborates on plausible approaches used for language model adaptation to specific scenarios, such as embedding, retrieval augmented generation, and function calling. The Kanana model series spans from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters with 2.1B models (base, instruct, embedding) publicly released to promote research on Korean language models.</description>

      <title>JailBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Security Assessment Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive safety evaluations. In particular, the enhanced Chinese language proficiency of LLMs, combined with the unique characteristics and complexity of Chinese expressions, has driven the emergence of Chinese-specific benchmarks for safety assessment. However, these benchmarks generally fall short in effectively exposing LLM safety vulnerabilities. To address the gap, we introduce JailBench, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark for evaluating deep-seated vulnerabilities in LLMs, featuring a refined hierarchical safety taxonomy tailored to the Chinese context. To improve generation efficiency, we employ a novel Automatic Jailbreak Prompt Engineer (AJPE) framework for JailBench construction, which incorporates jailbreak techniques to enhance assessing effectiveness and leverages LLMs to automatically scale up the dataset through context-learning. The proposed JailBench is extensively evaluated over 13 mainstream LLMs and achieves the highest attack success rate against ChatGPT compared to existing Chinese benchmarks, underscoring its efficacy in identifying latent vulnerabilities in LLMs, as well as illustrating the substantial room for improvement in the security and trustworthiness of LLMs within the Chinese context. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/STAIR-BUPT/JailBench.</description>

      <title>MathTutorBench: A Benchmark for Measuring Open-ended Pedagogical Capabilities of LLM Tutors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the pedagogical capabilities of AI-based tutoring models is critical for making guided progress in the field. Yet, we lack a reliable, easy-to-use, and simple-to-run evaluation that reflects the pedagogical abilities of models. To fill this gap, we present MathTutorBench, an open-source benchmark for holistic tutoring model evaluation. MathTutorBench contains a collection of datasets and metrics that broadly cover tutor abilities as defined by learning sciences research in dialog-based teaching. To score the pedagogical quality of open-ended teacher responses, we train a reward model and show it can discriminate expert from novice teacher responses with high accuracy. We evaluate a wide set of closed- and open-weight models on MathTutorBench and find that subject expertise, indicated by solving ability, does not immediately translate to good teaching. Rather, pedagogy and subject expertise appear to form a trade-off that is navigated by the degree of tutoring specialization of the model. Furthermore, tutoring appears to become more challenging in longer dialogs, where simpler questioning strategies begin to fail. We release the benchmark, code, and leaderboard openly to enable rapid benchmarking of future models.</description>

      <title>Know You First and Be You Better: Modeling Human-Like User Simulators via Implicit Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, existing simulators often rely solely on text utterances, missing implicit user traits such as personality, speaking style, and goals. In contrast, persona-based methods lack generalizability, as they depend on predefined profiles of famous individuals or archetypes. To address these challenges, we propose User Simulator with implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine conversations and uses them to generate more personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema. Then, we refine the simulation through conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing it at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, we adopt a diverse profile sampler to capture the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results demonstrate that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while achieving comparable performance in consistency. Furthermore, dynamic multi-turn evaluations based on USP strongly align with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Confidence Gold: Refining Low-Confidence Samples for Efficient Instruction Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of instruction fine-tuning for Large Language Models is fundamentally constrained by the quality and efficiency of training datasets. This work introduces Low-Confidence Gold (LCG), a novel filtering framework that employs centroid-based clustering and confidence-guided selection for identifying valuable instruction pairs. Through a semi-supervised approach using a lightweight classifier trained on representative samples, LCG curates high-quality subsets while preserving data diversity. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on LCG-filtered subsets of 6K samples achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, with substantial improvements on MT-bench and consistent gains across comprehensive evaluation metrics. The framework's efficacy while maintaining model performance establishes a promising direction for efficient instruction tuning.</description>

      <title>PEToolLLM: Towards Personalized Tool Learning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tool learning has emerged as a promising direction by extending Large Language Models' (LLMs) capabilities with external tools. Existing tool learning studies primarily focus on the general-purpose tool-use capability, which addresses explicit user requirements in instructions. However, they overlook the importance of personalized tool-use capability, leading to an inability to handle implicit user preferences. To address the limitation, we first formulate the task of personalized tool learning, which integrates user's interaction history towards personalized tool usage. To fill the gap of missing benchmarks, we construct PEToolBench, featuring diverse user preferences reflected in interaction history under three distinct personalized settings, and encompassing a wide range of tool-use scenarios. Moreover, we propose a framework PEToolLLaMA to adapt LLMs to the personalized tool learning task, which is trained through supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments on PEToolBench demonstrate the superiority of PEToolLLaMA over existing LLMs.</description>

      <title>GenTool: Enhancing Tool Generalization in Language Models through Zero-to-One and Weak-to-Strong Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance their capabilities as AI assistants by integrating external tools, allowing them to access a wider range of information. While recent LLMs are typically fine-tuned with tool usage examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), questions remain about their ability to develop robust tool-usage skills and can effectively generalize to unseen queries and tools. In this work, we present GenTool, a novel training framework that prepares LLMs for diverse generalization challenges in tool utilization. Our approach addresses two fundamental dimensions critical for real-world applications: Zero-to-One Generalization, enabling the model to address queries initially lacking a suitable tool by adopting and utilizing one when it becomes available, and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, allowing models to leverage enhanced versions of existing tools to solve queries. To achieve this, we develop synthetic training data simulating these two dimensions of tool usage and introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach: optimizing tool ranking, then refining tool selection. Through extensive experiments across four generalization scenarios, we demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the tool-usage capabilities of LLMs ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, achieving performance that surpasses GPT-4o. Furthermore, our analysis also provides valuable insights into the challenges LLMs encounter in tool generalization.</description>

      <title>MEBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Cross-Document Multi-Entity Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-entity question answering (MEQA) represents significant challenges for large language models (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which frequently struggle to consolidate scattered information across diverse documents. While existing methods excel at single-document comprehension, they often struggle with cross-document aggregation, particularly when resolving entity-dense questions like "What is the distribution of ACM Fellows among various fields of study?", which require integrating entity-centric insights from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Wikipedia pages). To address this gap, we introduce MEBench, a novel multi-document, multi-entity benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capacity to retrieve, consolidate, and reason over fragmented information. Our benchmark comprises 4,780 questions which are systematically categorized into three primary categories, further divided into eight distinct types, ensuring broad coverage of real-world multi-entity reasoning scenarios. Our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Llama-3) and RAG pipelines reveal critical limitations: even advanced models achieve only 59% accuracy on MEBench. Our benchmark emphasizes the importance of completeness and factual precision of information extraction in MEQA tasks, using Entity-Attributed F1 (EA-F1) metric for granular evaluation of entity-level correctness and attribution validity. MEBench not only highlights systemic weaknesses in current LLM frameworks but also provides a foundation for advancing robust, entity-aware QA architectures.</description>

      <title>Binary Neural Networks for Large Language Model: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have wide applications in the field of natural language processing(NLP), such as GPT-4 and Llama. However, with the exponential growth of model parameter sizes, LLMs bring significant resource overheads. Low-bit quantization, as a key technique, reduces memory usage and computational demands by decreasing the bit-width of model parameters, activations, and gradients. Previous quantization methods for LLMs have largely employed Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT). PTQ does not require any retraining of the original model, while QAT involves optimizing precision during training to achieve the best quantization parameters. The BitNet team proposed a radically different approach, where quantization is performed from the start of model training, utilizing low-precision binary weights during the training process. This approach has led to the emergence of many binary quantization techniques for large language models. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these binary quantization techniques. Specifically, we will introduce binary quantization techniques in deep neural networks and further explore their application to LLMs, reviewing their various contributions, implementations, and applications.</description>

      <title>MathClean: A Benchmark for Synthetic Mathematical Data Cleaning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the quality of training data has become crucial. Among the various types of training data, mathematical data plays a key role in enabling LLMs to acquire strong reasoning abilities. While high-quality open-source data is important, it is often insufficient for pre-training, necessitating the addition of synthetic math problems. However, synthetic math questions and answers can introduce inaccuracies, which may degrade both the training data and web data. Therefore, an effective method for cleaning synthetic math data is essential. In this paper, we propose the MathClean benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of math data cleaning models. The MathClean benchmark consists of 2,000 correct questions and 2,000 erroneous questions with additional 2,000 correct and erroneous answers sourced from augmented data based on GSM8K and MATH. Moreover, we also annotate error types for each question or answer, since it can assess whether models can correctly identify the error categories for future improvements. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluations using state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our results demonstrate that even strong models like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 perform poorly on this benchmark, highlighting the utility of MathClean.

      <description>arXiv:2502.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT) evaluates creativity through holistic expert judgments. We investigate the use of two advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), Claude-3-Opus and GPT-4o, to evaluate poetry by a methodology inspired by the CAT. Using a dataset of 90 poems, we found that these LLMs can surpass the results achieved by non-expert human judges at matching a ground truth based on publication venue, particularly when assessing smaller subsets of poems. Claude-3-Opus exhibited slightly superior performance than GPT-4o. We show that LLMs are viable tools for accurately assessing poetry, paving the way for their broader application into other creative domains.</description>

      <title>Improving the quality of Web-mined Parallel Corpora of Low-Resource Languages using Debiasing Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel Data Curation (PDC) techniques aim to filter out noisy parallel sentences from the web-mined corpora. Prior research has demonstrated that ranking sentence pairs using similarity scores on sentence embeddings derived from Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models (multiPLMs) and training the NMT systems with the top-ranked samples, produces superior NMT performance than when trained using the full dataset. However, previous research has shown that the choice of multiPLM significantly impacts the ranking quality. This paper investigates the reasons behind this disparity across multiPLMs. Using the web-mined corpora CCMatrix and CCAligned for En$\rightarrow$Si, En$\rightarrow$Ta and Si$\rightarrow$Ta, we show that different multiPLMs (LASER3, XLM-R, and LaBSE) are biased towards certain types of sentences, which allows noisy sentences to creep into the top-ranked samples. We show that by employing a series of heuristics, this noise can be removed to a certain extent. This results in improving the results of NMT systems trained with web-mined corpora and reduces the disparity across multiPLMs.</description>

      <title>Sparse Brains are Also Adaptive Brains: Cognitive-Load-Aware Dynamic Activation for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense large language models(LLMs) face critical efficiency bottlenecks as they rigidly activate all parameters regardless of input complexity. While existing sparsity methods(static pruning or dynamic activation) address this partially, they either lack adaptivity to contextual or model structural demands or incur prohibitive computational overhead. Inspired by human brain's dual-process mechanisms - predictive coding (N400) for backbone sparsity and structural reanalysis (P600) for complex context - we propose CLADA, a \textit{\textbf{C}ognitive-\textbf{L}oad-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{A}ctivation} framework that synergizes statistical sparsity with semantic adaptability. Our key insight is that LLM activations exhibit two complementary patterns: 1) \textit{Global statistical sparsity} driven by sequence-level prefix information, and 2) \textit{Local semantic adaptability} modulated by cognitive load metrics(e.g., surprisal and entropy). CLADA employs a hierarchical thresholding strategy: a baseline from offline error-controlled optimization ensures 40\%+ sparsity, dynamically adjusted by real-time cognitive signals. Evaluations across six mainstream LLMs and nine benchmarks demonstrate that CLADA achieves \textbf{~20\% average speedup with &lt;2\% accuracy drop}, outperforming Griffin (5\%+ degradation) and TT (negligible speedup). Crucially, we establish the first formal connection between neurolinguistic event-related potential (ERP) components and LLM efficiency mechanisms through multi-level regression analysis ($R^2=0.17$ for sparsity-adaptation synergy).

      <title>LongEval: A Comprehensive Analysis of Long-Text Generation Through a Plan-based Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to generate long-form content remains poorly understood and evaluated. Our analysis reveals that current LLMs struggle with length requirements and information density in long-text generation, with performance deteriorating as text length increases. To quantitively locate such a performance degradation and provide further insights on model development, we present LongEval, a benchmark that evaluates long-text generation through both direct and plan-based generation paradigms, inspired by cognitive and linguistic writing models. The comprehensive experiments in this work reveal interesting findings such as that while model size correlates with generation ability, the small-scale model (e.g., LongWriter), well-trained on long texts, has comparable performance. All code and datasets are released in https://github.com/Wusiwei0410/LongEval.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gender Bias in German Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present WinoMTDE, a new gender bias evaluation test set designed to assess occupational stereotyping and underrepresentation in German machine translation (MT) systems. Building on the automatic evaluation method introduced by arXiv:1906.00591v1 [cs.CL], we extend the approach to German, a language with grammatical gender. The WinoMTDE dataset comprises 288 German sentences that are balanced in regard to gender, as well as stereotype, which was annotated using German labor statistics. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of five widely used MT systems and a large language model. Our results reveal persistent bias in most models, with the LLM outperforming traditional systems. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available under https://github.com/michellekappl/mt_gender_german.</description>

      <title>Conformal Linguistic Calibration: Trading-off between Factuality and Specificity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model outputs are not always reliable; this prompts research into methods for adapting model responses based on uncertainty. Common approaches include: \emph{abstention}, where models refrain from generating responses when uncertain; and \emph{linguistic calibration}, where models hedge their statements using uncertainty quantifiers. However, abstention can withhold valuable information, while linguistically calibrated responses are often challenging to leverage in downstream tasks. We propose a unifying view of both approaches, Conformal Linguistic Calibration (CLC), reinterpreting linguistic calibration as answer set prediction. We begin by presenting a unified framework that connects abstention and linguistic calibration through the lens of linguistic pragmatics. We then describe an implementation that allows for controlling the level of imprecision in model responses. Experimental results show that our method produces calibrated outputs with conformal guarantees on factual accuracy. Furthermore, our approach enables fine-tuning models to perform uncertainty-aware adaptive claim rewriting, offering a controllable balance between factuality and specificity.</description>

      <title>Improving customer service with automatic topic detection in user emails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel Natural Language Processing pipeline that enhances customer service efficiency at Telekom Srbija, a leading Serbian telecommunications company, through automated email topic detection and labelling. Central to the pipeline is BERTopic, a modular architecture that allows unsupervised topic modelling. After a series of preprocessing and post-processing steps, we assign one of 12 topics and several additional labels to incoming emails, allowing customer service to filter and access them through a custom-made application. The model's performance was evaluated by assessing the speed and correctness of the automatically assigned topics across a test dataset of 100 customer emails. The pipeline shows broad applicability across languages, particularly for those that are low-resourced and morphologically rich. The system now operates in the company's production environment, streamlining customer service operations through automated email classification.</description>

      <title>Self-Memory Alignment: Mitigating Factual Hallucinations with Generalized Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to align their responses with objective facts, resulting in the issue of factual hallucinations, which can be difficult to detect and mislead users without relevant knowledge. While post-training techniques have been employed to mitigate the issue, existing methods usually suffer from poor generalization and trade-offs in different capabilities. In this paper, we propose to address it by directly augmenting LLM's fundamental ability to precisely leverage its existing memory--the knowledge acquired from pre-training data. We introduce self-memory alignment (SMA), which fine-tunes the model on self-generated responses to precise and simple factual questions through preference optimization. Furthermore, we construct FactualBench, a comprehensive and precise factual QA dataset containing 181k Chinese data spanning 21 domains, to facilitate both evaluation and training. Extensive experiments show that SMA significantly improves LLMs' overall performance, with consistent enhancement across various benchmarks concerning factuality, as well as helpfulness and comprehensive skills.</description>

      <title>Amulet: ReAlignment During Test Time for Personalized Preference Adaptation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to align large language models (LLMs) with user preferences from a static general dataset has been frequently studied. However, user preferences are usually personalized, changing, and diverse regarding culture, values, or time. This leads to the problem that the actual user preferences often do not coincide with those trained by the model developers in the practical use of LLMs. Since we cannot collect enough data and retrain for every demand, researching efficient real-time preference adaptation methods based on the backbone LLMs during test time is important. To this end, we introduce Amulet, a novel, training-free framework that formulates the decoding process of every token as a separate online learning problem with the guidance of simple user-provided prompts, thus enabling real-time optimization to satisfy users' personalized preferences. To reduce the computational cost brought by this optimization process for each token, we additionally provide a closed-form solution for each iteration step of the optimization process, thereby reducing the computational time cost to a negligible level. The detailed experimental results demonstrate that Amulet can achieve significant performance improvements in rich settings with combinations of different LLMs, datasets, and user preferences, while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>When Personalization Meets Reality: A Multi-Faceted Analysis of Personalized Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, it typically assumes homogeneous preferences across users, overlooking diverse human values and minority viewpoints. Although personalized preference learning addresses this by tailoring separate preferences for individual users, the field lacks standardized methods to assess its effectiveness. We present a multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures not only performance but also fairness, unintended effects, and adaptability across varying levels of preference divergence. Through extensive experiments comparing eight personalization methods across three preference datasets, we demonstrate that performance differences between methods could reach 36% when users strongly disagree, and personalization can introduce up to 20% safety misalignment. These findings highlight the critical need for holistic evaluation approaches to advance the development of more effective and inclusive preference learning systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Linguistic Indicators for Stereotype Assessment with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social categories and stereotypes are embedded in language and can introduce data bias into Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite safeguards, these biases often persist in model behavior, potentially leading to representational harm in outputs. While sociolinguistic research provides valuable insights into the formation of stereotypes, NLP approaches for stereotype detection rarely draw on this foundation and often lack objectivity, precision, and interpretability. To fill this gap, in this work we propose a new approach that detects and quantifies the linguistic indicators of stereotypes in a sentence. We derive linguistic indicators from the Social Category and Stereotype Communication (SCSC) framework which indicate strong social category formulation and stereotyping in language, and use them to build a categorization scheme. To automate this approach, we instruct different LLMs using in-context learning to apply the approach to a sentence, where the LLM examines the linguistic properties and provides a basis for a fine-grained assessment. Based on an empirical evaluation of the importance of different linguistic indicators, we learn a scoring function that measures the linguistic indicators of a stereotype. Our annotations of stereotyped sentences show that these indicators are present in these sentences and explain the strength of a stereotype. In terms of model performance, our results show that the models generally perform well in detecting and classifying linguistic indicators of category labels used to denote a category, but sometimes struggle to correctly evaluate the associated behaviors and characteristics. Using more few-shot examples within the prompts, significantly improves performance. Model performance increases with size, as Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4 achieve comparable results that surpass those of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, GPT-4-mini and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>TestNUC: Enhancing Test-Time Computing Approaches through Neighboring Unlabeled Data Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time computing approaches, which leverage additional computational resources during inference, have been proven effective in enhancing large language model performance. This work introduces a novel, linearly scaling approach, TestNUC, that improves test-time predictions by leveraging the local consistency of neighboring unlabeled data-it classifies an input instance by considering not only the model's prediction on that instance but also on neighboring unlabeled instances. We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse datasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and emotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline methods such as standard prompting and self-consistency. Furthermore, TestNUC can be seamlessly integrated with existing test-time computing approaches, substantially boosting their performance. Our analysis reveals that TestNUC scales effectively with increasing amounts of unlabeled data and performs robustly across different embedding models, making it practical for real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/HenryPengZou/TestNUC.</description>

      <title>MEDDxAgent: A Unified Modular Agent Framework for Explainable Automatic Differential Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Diagnosis (DDx) is a fundamental yet complex aspect of clinical decision-making, in which physicians iteratively refine a ranked list of possible diseases based on symptoms, antecedents, and medical knowledge. While recent advances in large language models have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process.</description>

      <title>BIG-Bench Extra Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh.</description>

      <title>LiGT: Layout-infused Generative Transformer for Visual Question Answering on Vietnamese Receipts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Purpose:} Document Visual Question Answering (document VQA) challenges multimodal systems to holistically handle textual, layout, and visual modalities to provide appropriate answers. Document VQA has gained popularity in recent years due to the increasing amount of documents and the high demand for digitization. Nonetheless, most of document VQA datasets are developed in high-resource languages such as English.
  \textbf{Methods:} In this paper, we present ReceiptVQA (\textbf{Receipt} \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering), the initial large-scale document VQA dataset in Vietnamese dedicated to receipts, a document kind with high commercial potentials. The dataset encompasses \textbf{9,000+} receipt images and \textbf{60,000+} manually annotated question-answer pairs. In addition to our study, we introduce LiGT (\textbf{L}ayout-\textbf{i}nfused \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{T}ransformer), a layout-aware encoder-decoder architecture designed to leverage embedding layers of language models to operate layout embeddings, minimizing the use of additional neural modules.
  \textbf{Results:} Experiments on ReceiptVQA show that our architecture yielded promising performance, achieving competitive results compared with outstanding baselines. Furthermore, throughout analyzing experimental results, we found evident patterns that employing encoder-only model architectures has considerable disadvantages in comparison to architectures that can generate answers. We also observed that it is necessary to combine multiple modalities to tackle our dataset, despite the critical role of semantic understanding from language models.
  \textbf{Conclusion:} We hope that our work will encourage and facilitate future development in Vietnamese document VQA, contributing to a diverse multimodal research community in the Vietnamese language.</description>

      <title>FaithUn: Toward Faithful Forgetting in Language Models by Investigating the Interconnectedness of Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various studies have attempted to remove sensitive or private knowledge from a language model to prevent its unauthorized exposure. However, prior studies have overlooked the complex and interconnected nature of knowledge, where related knowledge must be carefully examined. Specifically, they have failed to evaluate whether an unlearning method faithfully erases interconnected knowledge that should be removed, retaining knowledge that appears relevant but exists in a completely different context. To resolve this problem, we first define a new concept called superficial unlearning, which refers to the phenomenon where an unlearning method either fails to erase the interconnected knowledge it should remove or unintentionally erases irrelevant knowledge. Based on the definition, we introduce a new benchmark, FaithUn, to analyze and evaluate the faithfulness of unlearning in real-world knowledge QA settings. Furthermore, we propose a novel unlearning method, KLUE, which updates only knowledge-related neurons to achieve faithful unlearning. KLUE identifies knowledge neurons using an explainability method and updates only those neurons using selected unforgotten samples. Experimental results demonstrate that widely-used unlearning methods fail to ensure faithful unlearning, while our method shows significant effectiveness in real-world QA unlearning.</description>

      <title>MultiConAD: A Unified Multilingual Conversational Dataset for Early Alzheimer's Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dementia is a progressive cognitive syndrome with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the leading cause. Conversation-based AD detection offers a cost-effective alternative to clinical methods, as language dysfunction is an early biomarker of AD. However, most prior research has framed AD detection as a binary classification problem, limiting the ability to identify Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-a crucial stage for early intervention. Also, studies primarily rely on single-language datasets, mainly in English, restricting cross-language generalizability. To address this gap, we make three key contributions. First, we introduce a novel, multilingual dataset for AD detection by unifying 16 publicly available dementia-related conversational datasets. This corpus spans English, Spanish, Chinese, and Greek and incorporates both audio and text data derived from a variety of cognitive assessment tasks. Second, we perform finer-grained classification, including MCI, and evaluate various classifiers using sparse and dense text representations. Third, we conduct experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings, finding that some languages benefit from multilingual training while others perform better independently. This study highlights the challenges in multilingual AD detection and enables future research on both language-specific approaches and techniques aimed at improving model generalization and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively reduces hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) but can still produce inconsistent or unsupported content. Although LLM-as-a-Judge is widely used for RAG hallucination detection due to its implementation simplicity, it faces two main challenges: the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and the lack of domain-optimized judge models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{Bi'an}, a novel framework featuring a bilingual benchmark dataset and lightweight judge models. The dataset supports rigorous evaluation across multiple RAG scenarios, while the judge models are fine-tuned from compact open-source LLMs. Extensive experimental evaluations on Bi'anBench show our 14B model outperforms baseline models with over five times larger parameter scales and rivals state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs. We will release our data and models soon at https://github.com/OpenSPG/KAG.</description>

      <title>Negation-Induced Forgetting in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit negation-induced forgetting (NIF), a cognitive phenomenon observed in humans where negating incorrect attributes of an object or event leads to diminished recall of this object or event compared to affirming correct attributes (Mayo et al., 2014; Zang et al., 2023). We adapted Zang et al. (2023) experimental framework to test this effect in ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4o mini and Llama3-70b-instruct. Our results show that ChatGPT-3.5 exhibits NIF, with negated information being less likely to be recalled than affirmed information. GPT-4o-mini showed a marginally significant NIF effect, while LLaMA-3-70B did not exhibit NIF. The findings provide initial evidence of negation-induced forgetting in some LLMs, suggesting that similar cognitive biases may emerge in these models. This work is a preliminary step in understanding how memory-related phenomena manifest in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Two Heads Are Better Than One: Dual-Model Verbal Reflection at Inference-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning scenarios. While preference optimization methods enhance reasoning performance through training, they often lack transparency in why one reasoning outcome is preferred over another. Verbal reflection techniques improve explainability but are limited in LLMs' critique and refinement capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce a contrastive reflection synthesis pipeline that enhances the accuracy and depth of LLM-generated reflections. We further propose a dual-model reasoning framework within a verbal reinforcement learning paradigm, decoupling inference-time self-reflection into specialized, trained models for reasoning critique and refinement. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional preference optimization methods across all evaluation metrics. Our findings also show that "two heads are better than one", demonstrating that a collaborative Reasoner-Critic model achieves superior reasoning performance and transparency, compared to single-model approaches.</description>

      <title>Between Circuits and Chomsky: Pre-pretraining on Formal Languages Imparts Linguistic Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining language models on formal languages can improve their acquisition of natural language, but it is unclear which features of the formal language impart an inductive bias that leads to effective transfer. Drawing on insights from linguistics and complexity theory, we hypothesize that effective transfer occurs when the formal language both captures dependency structures in natural language and remains within the computational limitations of the model architecture. Focusing on transformers, we find that formal languages with both these properties enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and better linguistic generalization compared to other languages. In fact, pre-pretraining, or training on formal-then-natural language, reduces loss more efficiently than the same amount of natural language. For a 1B-parameter language model trained on roughly 1.6B tokens of natural language, pre-pretraining achieves the same loss and better linguistic generalization with a 33% smaller token budget. We also give mechanistic evidence of cross-task transfer from formal to natural language: attention heads acquired during formal language pretraining remain crucial for the model's performance on syntactic evaluations.</description>

      <title>Drop-Upcycling: Training Sparse Mixture of Experts with Partial Re-initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more. As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs. All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE.</description>

      <title>Disentangled VAD Representations via a Variational Framework for Political Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stance detection task aims to categorise the stance regarding specified targets. Current methods face challenges in effectively integrating sentiment information for stance detection. Moreover, the role of highly granular sentiment labelling in stance detection has been largely overlooked. This study presents a novel stance detection framework utilizing a variational autoencoder (VAE) to disentangle latent emotional features-value, arousal, and dominance (VAD)-from political discourse on social media. This approach addresses limitations in current methods, particularly in in-target and cross-target stance detection scenarios. This research uses an advanced emotional annotation tool to annotate seven-class sentiment labels for P-STANCE. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including P-STANCE and SemEval-2016, reveal that PoliStance-VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like BERT, BERTweet, and GPT-4o. PoliStance-VAE offers a robust and interpretable solution for stance detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating nuanced emotional representations. This framework paves the way for advancements in natural language processing tasks, particularly those requiring detailed emotional understanding.</description>

      <title>CritiQ: Mining Data Quality Criteria from Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language model heavily depends on high-quality data for optimal performance. Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, or careful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only $\sim$30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier- based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and possess reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the code, math, and logic domains, achieving high accuracy on human-annotated test sets. To validate the quality of the selected data, we continually train Llama 3.1 models and observe improved performance on downstream tasks compared to uniform sampling. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the knowledge base and the reflection process. We analyze how criteria evolve and the effectiveness of majority voting.</description>

      <title>Shh, don't say that! Domain Certification in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to perform constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.</description>

      <title>Agentic Reward Modeling: Integrating Human Preferences with Verifiable Correctness Signals for Reliable Reward Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for the training and inference-time scaling up of large language models (LLMs). However, existing reward models primarily focus on human preferences, neglecting verifiable correctness signals which have shown strong potential in training LLMs. In this paper, we propose agentic reward modeling, a reward system that combines reward models with verifiable correctness signals from different aspects to provide reliable rewards. We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models. Our codes are publicly released to facilitate further research (https://github.com/THU-KEG/Agentic-Reward-Modeling).</description>

      <title>Evaluating LLMs and Pre-trained Models for Text Summarization Across Diverse Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text summarization plays a crucial role in natural language processing by condensing large volumes of text into concise and coherent summaries. As digital content continues to grow rapidly and the demand for effective information retrieval increases, text summarization has become a focal point of research in recent years. This study offers a thorough evaluation of four leading pre-trained and open-source large language models: BART, FLAN-T5, LLaMA-3-8B, and Gemma-7B, across five diverse datasets CNN/DM, Gigaword, News Summary, XSum, and BBC News. The evaluation employs widely recognized automatic metrics, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and METEOR, to assess the models' capabilities in generating coherent and informative summaries. The results reveal the comparative strengths and limitations of these models in processing various text types.</description>

      <title>Controlled Diversity: Length-optimized Natural Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are not generally able to adjust the length of their outputs based on strict length requirements, a capability that would improve their usefulness in applications that require adherence to diverse user and system requirements. We present an approach to train LLMs to acquire this capability by augmenting existing data and applying existing fine-tuning techniques, which we compare based on the trained models' adherence to the length requirement and overall response quality relative to the baseline model. Our results demonstrate that these techniques can be successfully applied to train LLMs to adhere to length requirements, with the trained models generating texts which better align to the length requirements. Our results indicate that our method may change the response quality when using training data that was not generated by the baseline model. This allows simultaneous alignment to another training objective in certain scenarios, but is undesirable otherwise. Training on a dataset containing the model's own responses eliminates this issue.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Detect Errors in Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</description>

      <title>DataMan: Data Manager for Pre-training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by ``reverse thinking'' -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a Data Manager (DataMan) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the Overall Score l=5 surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other: code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable steps that drive more advanced code intelligence. In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.</description>

      <title>The Mighty ToRR: A Benchmark for Table Reasoning and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its real-world significance, model performance on tabular data remains underexplored, leaving uncertainty about which model to rely on and which prompt configuration to adopt. To address this gap, we create ToRR, a benchmark for Table Reasoning and Robustness, that measures model performance and robustness on table-related tasks. The benchmark includes 10 datasets that cover different types of table reasoning capabilities across varied domains. ToRR goes beyond model performance rankings, and is designed to reflect whether models can handle tabular data consistently and robustly, across a variety of common table representation formats. We present a leaderboard as well as comprehensive analyses of the results of leading models over ToRR. Our results reveal a striking pattern of brittle model behavior, where even strong models are unable to perform robustly on tabular data tasks. Although no specific table format leads to consistently better performance, we show that testing over multiple formats is crucial for reliably estimating model capabilities. Moreover, we show that the reliability boost from testing multiple prompts can be equivalent to adding more test examples. Overall, our findings show that table understanding and reasoning tasks remain a significant challenge.</description>

      <title>Norm Growth and Stability Challenges in Localized Sequential Knowledge Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of localized updates to large language models (LLMs), specifically in the context of knowledge editing - a task aimed at incorporating or modifying specific facts without altering broader model capabilities. We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.</description>

      <title>FinBloom: Knowledge Grounding Large Language Model with Real-time Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like responses but often struggle with interactive tasks that require access to real-time information. This limitation poses challenges in finance, where models must access up-to-date information, such as recent news or price movements, to support decision-making. To address this, we introduce Financial Agent, a knowledge-grounding approach for LLMs to handle financial queries using real-time text and tabular data. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a Financial Context Dataset of over 50,000 financial queries paired with the required context. Second, we train FinBloom 7B, a custom 7 billion parameter LLM, on 14 million financial news articles from Reuters and Deutsche Presse-Agentur, alongside 12 million Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. Third, we fine-tune FinBloom 7B using the Financial Context Dataset to serve as a Financial Agent. This agent generates relevant financial context, enabling efficient real-time data retrieval to answer user queries. By reducing latency and eliminating the need for users to manually provide accurate data, our approach significantly enhances the capability of LLMs to handle dynamic financial tasks. Our proposed approach makes real-time financial decisions, algorithmic trading and other related tasks streamlined, and is valuable in contexts with high-velocity data flows.</description>

      <title>QExplorer: Large Language Model Based Query Extraction for Toxic Content Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically extracting effective queries is challenging in information retrieval, especially in toxic content exploration, as such content is likely to be disguised. With the recent achievements in generative Large Language Model (LLM), we are able to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to extract effective queries for similar content exploration directly. This study proposes QExplorer, an approach of large language model based Query Extraction for toxic content Exploration. The QExplorer approach involves a 2-stage training process: instruction Supervised FineTuning (SFT) and preference alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), as well as the datasets construction with feedback of search system. To verify the effectiveness of QExplorer, a series of offline and online experiments are conducted on our real-world system. The offline empirical results demonstrate that the performance of our automatic query extraction outperforms that of several LLMs and humans. The online deployment shows a significant increase in the detection of toxic items.</description>

      <title>AuPair: Golden Example Pairs for Code Repair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling up inference-time compute has proven to be a valuable strategy in improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. An important task that can benefit from additional inference-time compute is self-repair; given an initial flawed response, or guess, the LLM corrects its own mistake and produces an improved response, or fix. We leverage the in-context learning ability of LLMs to perform self-repair in the coding domain. The key contribution of our paper is an approach that synthesises and selects an ordered set of golden example pairs, or AuPairs, of these initial guesses and subsequent fixes for the corresponding problems. Each such AuPair is provided as a single in-context example at inference time to generate a repaired solution. For an inference-time compute budget of $N$ LLM calls per problem, $N$ AuPairs are used to generate $N$ repaired solutions, out of which the highest-scoring solution is selected as the final answer. The underlying intuition is that if the LLM is given a different example of fixing an incorrect guess each time, it can subsequently generate a diverse set of repaired solutions. Our algorithm selects these AuPairs in a manner that maximises complementarity and usefulness. We demonstrate the results of our algorithm on 5 LLMs across 7 competitive programming datasets for the code repair task. Our algorithm yields a significant boost in performance compared to best-of-$N$ and self-repair, and also exhibits strong generalisation across datasets and models. Moreover, our approach shows significantly stronger scaling with inference-time compute budget compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Language Models in Syntactic Code Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, language models (LMs) have shown impressive proficiency in code generation tasks, especially when fine-tuned on code-specific datasets, commonly known as Code LMs. However, our understanding of the internal decision-making processes of Code LMs, such as how they use their (syntactic or semantic) knowledge, remains limited, which could lead to unintended harm as they are increasingly used in real life. This motivates us to conduct one of the first Mechanistic Interpretability works to understand how Code LMs perform a syntactic completion task, specifically the closing parenthesis task, on the CodeLlama-7b model (Roziere et al. 2023). Our findings reveal that the model requires middle-later layers until it can confidently predict the correct label for the closing parenthesis task. Additionally, we identify that while both multi-head attention (MHA) and feed-forward (FF) sub-layers play essential roles, MHA is particularly crucial. Furthermore, we also discover attention heads that keep track of the number of already closed parentheses precisely but may or may not promote a correct number of closing parentheses that are still missing, leading to a positive or negative impact on the model's performance.</description>

      <title>TurboFuzzLLM: Turbocharging Mutation-based Fuzzing for Effectively Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jailbreaking large-language models (LLMs) involves testing their robustness against adversarial prompts and evaluating their ability to withstand prompt attacks that could elicit unauthorized or malicious responses. In this paper, we present TurboFuzzLLM, a mutation-based fuzzing technique for efficiently finding a collection of effective jailbreaking templates that, when combined with harmful questions, can lead a target LLM to produce harmful responses through black-box access via user prompts. We describe the limitations of directly applying existing template-based attacking techniques in practice, and present functional and efficiency-focused upgrades we added to mutation-based fuzzing to generate effective jailbreaking templates automatically. TurboFuzzLLM achieves $\geq$ 95\% attack success rates (ASR) on public datasets for leading LLMs (including GPT-4o \&amp; GPT-4 Turbo), shows impressive generalizability to unseen harmful questions, and helps in improving model defenses to prompt attacks.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Transparency and Accessibility of ChatGPT, DeepSeek, And other SoTA Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite increasing discussions on open-source Artificial Intelligence (AI), existing research lacks a discussion on the transparency and accessibility of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Large Language Models (LLMs). The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has recently released its first formal definition of open-source software. This definition, when combined with standard dictionary definitions and the sparse published literature, provide an initial framework to support broader accessibility to AI models such as LLMs, but more work is essential to capture the unique dynamics of openness in AI. In addition, concerns about open-washing, where models claim openness but lack full transparency, has been raised, which limits the reproducibility, bias mitigation, and domain adaptation of these models. In this context, our study critically analyzes SoTA LLMs from the last five years, including ChatGPT, DeepSeek, LLaMA, and others, to assess their adherence to transparency standards and the implications of partial openness. Specifically, we examine transparency and accessibility from two perspectives: open-source vs. open-weight models. Our findings reveal that while some models are labeled as open-source, this does not necessarily mean they are fully open-sourced. Even in the best cases, open-source models often do not report model training data, and code as well as key metrics, such as weight accessibility, and carbon emissions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that systematically examines the transparency and accessibility of over 100 different SoTA LLMs through the dual lens of open-source and open-weight models. The findings open avenues for further research and call for responsible and sustainable AI practices to ensure greater transparency, accountability, and ethical deployment of these models.(DeepSeek transparency, ChatGPT accessibility, open source, DeepSeek open source)</description>

      <title>Analyzing User Perceptions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Reddit: Sentiment and Topic Modeling of ChatGPT and DeepSeek Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is an increased discourse on large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, there is no comprehensive understanding of how users of online platforms, like Reddit, perceive these models. This is an important omission because public opinion can influence AI development, trust, and future policy. This study aims at analyzing Reddit discussions about ChatGPT and DeepSeek using sentiment and topic modeling to advance the understanding of user attitudes. Some of the significant topics such as trust in AI, user expectations, potential uses of the tools, reservations about AI biases, and ethical implications of their use are explored in this study. By examining these concerns, the study provides a sense of how public sentiment might shape the direction of AI development going forward. The report also mentions whether users have faith in the technology and what they see as its future. A word frequency approach is used to identify broad topics and sentiment trends. Also, topic modeling through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method identifies top topics in users' language, for example, potential benefits of LLMs, their technological applications, and their overall social ramifications. The study aims to inform developers and policymakers by making it easier to see how users comprehend and experience these game-changing technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hepatopathy Clinical Trial Efficiency: A Secure, Large Language Model-Powered Pre-Screening Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Recruitment for cohorts involving complex liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, often requires interpreting semantically complex criteria. Traditional manual screening methods are time-consuming and prone to errors. While AI-powered pre-screening offers potential solutions, challenges remain regarding accuracy, efficiency, and data privacy. Methods: We developed a novel patient pre-screening pipeline that leverages clinical expertise to guide the precise, safe, and efficient application of large language models. The pipeline breaks down complex criteria into a series of composite questions and then employs two strategies to perform semantic question-answering through electronic health records - (1) Pathway A, Anthropomorphized Experts' Chain of Thought strategy, and (2) Pathway B, Preset Stances within an Agent Collaboration strategy, particularly in managing complex clinical reasoning scenarios. The pipeline is evaluated on three key metrics-precision, time consumption, and counterfactual inference - at both the question and criterion levels. Results: Our pipeline achieved high precision (0.921, in criteria level) and efficiency (0.44s per task). Pathway B excelled in complex reasoning, while Pathway A was effective in precise data extraction with faster processing times. Both pathways achieved comparable precision. The pipeline showed promising results in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.878) and cirrhosis trials (0.843). Conclusions: This data-secure and time-efficient pipeline shows high precision in hepatopathy trials, providing promising solutions for streamlining clinical trial workflows. Its efficiency and adaptability make it suitable for improving patient recruitment. And its capability to function in resource-constrained environments further enhances its utility in clinical settings.</description>

Abstract: Visual Question Answering requires models to generate accurate answers by integrating visual and textual understanding. However, VQA models still struggle with hallucinations, producing convincing but incorrect answers, particularly in knowledge-driven and Out-of-Distribution scenarios. We introduce FilterRAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that combines BLIP-VQA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ground answers in external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and DBpedia. FilterRAG achieves 36.5% accuracy on the OK-VQA dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving robustness in both in-domain and Out-of-Distribution settings. These findings highlight the potential of FilterRAG to improve Visual Question Answering systems for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>PII-Bench: Evaluating Query-Aware Privacy Protection Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant privacy concerns regarding the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) in user prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a query-unrelated PII masking strategy and introduce PII-Bench, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing privacy protection systems. PII-Bench comprises 2,842 test samples across 55 fine-grained PII categories, featuring diverse scenarios from single-subject descriptions to complex multi-party interactions. Each sample is carefully crafted with a user query, context description, and standard answer indicating query-relevant PII. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current models perform adequately in basic PII detection, they show significant limitations in determining PII query relevance. Even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, particularly in handling complex multi-subject scenarios, indicating substantial room for improvement in achieving intelligent PII masking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations validating the effectiveness of KCGen-KT. On a real-world dataset of student code submissions to open-ended programming problems, KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs have a comparable level-of-fit to human-written KCs under the performance factor analysis (PFA) model. We also conduct a human evaluation to show that the KC tagging accuracy of our pipeline is reasonably accurate when compared to that by human domain experts.</description>

      <title>Faster, Cheaper, Better: Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for LLM and RAG Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular technique for improving Large Language Model (LLM) systems, it introduces a large number of choices, parameters and hyperparameters that must be made or tuned. This includes the LLM, embedding, and ranker models themselves, as well as hyperparameters governing individual RAG components. Yet, collectively optimizing the entire configuration in a RAG or LLM system remains under-explored - especially in multi-objective settings - due to intractably large solution spaces, noisy objective evaluations, and the high cost of evaluations. In this work, we introduce the first approach for multi-objective parameter optimization of cost, latency, safety and alignment over entire LLM and RAG systems. We find that Bayesian optimization methods significantly outperform baseline approaches, obtaining a superior Pareto front on two new RAG benchmark tasks. We conclude our work with important considerations for practitioners who are designing multi-objective RAG systems, highlighting nuances such as how optimal configurations may not generalize across tasks and objectives.</description>

Abstract: Learning therapeutic counseling involves significant role-play experience with mock patients, with current manual training methods providing only intermittent granular feedback. We seek to accelerate and optimize counselor training by providing frequent, detailed feedback to trainees as they interact with a simulated patient. Our first application domain involves training motivational interviewing skills for counselors. Motivational interviewing is a collaborative counseling style in which patients are guided to talk about changing their behavior, with empathetic counseling an essential ingredient. We developed and evaluated an LLM-powered training system that features a simulated patient and visualizations of turn-by-turn performance feedback tailored to the needs of counselors learning motivational interviewing. We conducted an evaluation study with professional and student counselors, demonstrating high usability and satisfaction with the system. We present design implications for the development of automated systems that train users in counseling skills and their generalizability to other types of social skills training.</description>

      <title>Speaking the Right Language: The Impact of Expertise Alignment in User-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18685</link>

Abstract: Using a sample of 25,000 Bing Copilot conversations, we study how the agent responds to users of varying levels of domain expertise and the resulting impact on user experience along multiple dimensions. Our findings show that across a variety of topical domains, the agent largely responds at proficient or expert levels of expertise (77% of conversations) which correlates with positive user experience regardless of the user's level of expertise. Misalignment, such that the agent responds at a level of expertise below that of the user, has a negative impact on overall user experience, with the impact more profound for more complex tasks. We also show that users engage more, as measured by the number of words in the conversation, when the agent responds at a level of expertise commensurate with that of the user. Our findings underscore the importance of alignment between user and AI when designing human-centered AI systems, to ensure satisfactory and productive interactions.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Multi-Agent Framework for Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims to develop entity recognition systems from unannotated text corpora. This task presents substantial challenges due to minimal human intervention. Recent work has adapted large language models (LLMs) for zero-shot NER by crafting specialized prompt templates. It advances model self-learning abilities by incorporating self-annotated demonstrations. However, two important challenges persist: (i) Correlations between contexts surrounding entities are overlooked, leading to wrong type predictions or entity omissions. (ii) The indiscriminate use of task demonstrations, retrieved through shallow similarity-based strategies, severely misleads LLMs during inference.
  In this paper, we introduce the cooperative multi-agent system (CMAS), a novel framework for zero-shot NER that uses the collective intelligence of multiple agents to address the challenges outlined above. CMAS has four main agents: (i) a self-annotator, (ii) a type-related feature (TRF) extractor, (iii) a demonstration discriminator, and (iv) an overall predictor. To explicitly capture correlations between contexts surrounding entities, CMAS reformulates NER into two subtasks: recognizing named entities and identifying entity type-related features within the target sentence. To enable controllable utilization of demonstrations, a demonstration discriminator is established to incorporate the self-reflection mechanism, automatically evaluating helpfulness scores for the target sentence. Experimental results show that CMAS significantly improves zero-shot NER performance across six benchmarks, including both domain-specific and general-domain scenarios. Furthermore, CMAS demonstrates its effectiveness in few-shot settings and with various LLM backbones.</description>

      <title>Talking to the brain: Using Large Language Models as Proxies to Model Brain Semantic Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional psychological experiments utilizing naturalistic stimuli face challenges in manual annotation and ecological validity. To address this, we introduce a novel paradigm leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs) as proxies to extract rich semantic information from naturalistic images through a Visual Question Answering (VQA) strategy for analyzing human visual semantic representation. LLM-derived representations successfully predict established neural activity patterns measured by fMRI (e.g., faces, buildings), validating its feasibility and revealing hierarchical semantic organization across cortical regions. A brain semantic network constructed from LLM-derived representations identifies meaningful clusters reflecting functional and contextual associations. This innovative methodology offers a powerful solution for investigating brain semantic organization with naturalistic stimuli, overcoming limitations of traditional annotation methods and paving the way for more ecologically valid explorations of human cognition.</description>

      <title>Beyond RNNs: Benchmarking Attention-Based Image Captioning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image captioning is a challenging task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, requiring models to generate meaningful textual descriptions of images. Traditional approaches rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but recent advancements in attention mechanisms have demonstrated significant improvements. This study benchmarks the performance of attention-based image captioning models against RNN-based approaches using the MS-COCO dataset. We evaluate the effectiveness of Bahdanau attention in enhancing the alignment between image features and generated captions. The models are assessed using natural language processing metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, GLEU, and WER. Our results show that attention-based models outperform RNNs in generating more accurate and semantically rich captions, with better alignment to human evaluation. This work provides insights into the impact of attention mechanisms in image captioning and highlights areas for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Like Father, Like Son: Kinship-Aware Preference Mapping (KARMA) for Automatic Alignment in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment have sought to mitigate the cost of human annotations by leveraging pretrained models to generate preference data. However, existing methods often compare responses from models with substantially different capabilities, yielding superficial distinctions that fail to provide meaningful guidance on what constitutes a superior response. To address this limitation, we propose Kinship-Aware pReference MApping (KARMA), a novel framework that systematically pairs responses from models with comparable competencies. By constraining preference comparisons to outputs of similar complexity and quality, KARMA enhances the informativeness of preference data and improves the granularity of alignment signals. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our kinship-aware approach leads to more consistent and interpretable alignment outcomes, ultimately facilitating a more principled and reliable pathway for aligning LLM behavior with human preferences.</description>

      <title>Reward Shaping to Mitigate Reward Hacking in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. However, RLHF is susceptible to reward hacking, where the agent exploits flaws in the reward function rather than learning the intended behavior, thus degrading alignment. While reward shaping helps stabilize RLHF and partially mitigate reward hacking, a systematic investigation into shaping techniques and their underlying principles remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of the prevalent reward shaping methods. Our analysis suggests three key design principles: (1) RL reward is ideally bounded, (2) RL benefits from rapid initial growth followed by gradual convergence, and (3) RL reward is best formulated as a function of centered reward. Guided by these insights, we propose Preference As Reward (PAR), a novel approach that leverages the latent preferences embedded within the reward model itself as the signal for reinforcement learning. We evaluated PAR on two base models, Gemma2-2B and Llama3-8B, using two datasets, Ultrafeedback-Binarized and HH-RLHF. Experimental results demonstrate PAR's superior performance over other reward shaping methods. On the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark, PAR achieves a win rate at least 5 percentage points higher than competing approaches. Furthermore, PAR exhibits remarkable data efficiency, requiring only a single reference reward for optimal performance, and maintains robustness against reward hacking even after two full epochs of training. Code is available at https://github.com/PorUna-byte/PAR.</description>

      <title>M2-omni: Advancing Omni-MLLM for Comprehensive Modality Support with Competitive Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present M2-omni, a cutting-edge, open-source omni-MLLM that achieves competitive performance to GPT-4o. M2-omni employs a unified multimodal sequence modeling framework, which empowers Large Language Models(LLMs) to acquire comprehensive cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities. Specifically, M2-omni can process arbitrary combinations of audio, video, image, and text modalities as input, generating multimodal sequences interleaving with audio, image, or text outputs, thereby enabling an advanced and interactive real-time experience. The training of such an omni-MLLM is challenged by significant disparities in data quantity and convergence rates across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a step balance strategy during pre-training to handle the quantity disparities in modality-specific data. Additionally, a dynamically adaptive balance strategy is introduced during the instruction tuning stage to synchronize the modality-wise training progress, ensuring optimal convergence. Notably, we prioritize preserving strong performance on pure text tasks to maintain the robustness of M2-omni's language understanding capability throughout the training process. To our best knowledge, M2-omni is currently a very competitive open-source model to GPT-4o, characterized by its comprehensive modality and task support, as well as its exceptional performance. We expect M2-omni will advance the development of omni-MLLMs, thus facilitating future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Multi-draft Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an indispensable part of natural language processing tasks. However, autoregressive sampling has become an efficiency bottleneck. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) is a recent approach where, when generating each token, a small draft model generates multiple drafts, and the target LLM verifies them in parallel, ensuring that the final output conforms to the target model distribution. The two main design choices in MDSD are the draft sampling method and the verification algorithm. For a fixed draft sampling method, the optimal acceptance rate is a solution to an optimal transport problem, but the complexity of this problem makes it difficult to solve for the optimal acceptance rate and measure the gap between existing verification algorithms and the theoretical upper bound. This paper discusses the dual of the optimal transport problem, providing a way to efficiently compute the optimal acceptance rate. For the first time, we measure the theoretical upper bound of MDSD efficiency for vocabulary sizes in the thousands and quantify the gap between existing verification algorithms and this bound. We also compare different draft sampling methods based on their optimal acceptance rates. Our results show that the draft sampling method strongly influences the optimal acceptance rate, with sampling without replacement outperforming sampling with replacement. Additionally, existing verification algorithms do not reach the theoretical upper bound for both without replacement and with replacement sampling. Our findings suggest that carefully designed draft sampling methods can potentially improve the optimal acceptance rate and enable the development of verification algorithms that closely match the theoretical upper bound.</description>

      <title>Holistic Audit Dataset Generation for LLM Unlearning via Knowledge Graph Traversal and Redundancy Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have faced increasing demands to selectively remove sensitive information, protect privacy, and comply with copyright regulations through unlearning, by Machine Unlearning. While evaluating unlearning effectiveness is crucial, existing benchmarks are limited in scale and comprehensiveness, typically containing only a few hundred test cases. We identify two critical challenges in generating holistic audit datasets: ensuring audit adequacy and handling knowledge redundancy between forget and retain dataset. To address these challenges, we propose HANKER, an automated framework for holistic audit dataset generation leveraging knowledge graphs to achieve fine-grained coverage and eliminate redundant knowledge. Applying HANKER to the popular MUSE benchmark, we successfully generated over 69,000 and 111,000 audit cases for the News and Books datasets respectively, identifying thousands of knowledge memorization instances that the previous benchmark failed to detect. Our empirical analysis uncovers how knowledge redundancy significantly skews unlearning effectiveness metrics, with redundant instances artificially inflating the observed memorization measurements ROUGE from 19.7% to 26.1% and Entailment Scores from 32.4% to 35.2%, highlighting the necessity of systematic deduplication for accurate assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discovery relies on scientists generating novel hypotheses that undergo rigorous experimental validation. To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to their limitations in addressing the vast reasoning space and inherent ambiguities of natural language. We propose the Mixture-of-Search-Agents (MoSA) paradigm, a novel approach leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs to enhance search-based reasoning. MoSA integrates diverse reasoning pathways by combining independent exploration with iterative refinement among LLMs, mitigating the limitations of single-model approaches. Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a backbone, MoSA enables multiple agents to propose and aggregate reasoning steps, resulting in improved accuracy. Our comprehensive evaluation across four reasoning benchmarks demonstrates MoSA's consistent performance improvements over single-agent and other multi-agent baselines, particularly in complex mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Clip-TTS: Contrastive Text-content and Mel-spectrogram, A High-Huality Text-to-Speech Method based on Contextual Semantic Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion datasets.Audio samples are available at: https://ltydd1314.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Towards Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Pre-trained Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Although prior research has extensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically require accessing to complete output logits (\ie, \textit{logits-based attacks}), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the \textit{label-only setting}, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first reveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking pre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning datasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two main reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation. Specifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each sample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between members and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to capture such differences.
  To alleviate these problems, we propose \textbf{PETAL}: a label-only membership inference attack based on \textbf{PE}r-\textbf{T}oken sem\textbf{A}ntic simi\textbf{L}arity. Specifically, PETAL leverages token-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and subsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on the common assumption that members are `better' memorized and have smaller perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the more challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than the extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and even on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five prevalent open-source LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern foundation models rely heavily on using scaling laws to guide crucial training decisions. Researchers often extrapolate the optimal architecture and hyper parameters settings from smaller training runs by describing the relationship between, loss, or task performance, and scale. All components of this process vary, from the specific equation being fit, to the training setup, to the optimization method. Each of these factors may affect the fitted law, and therefore, the conclusions of a given study. We discuss discrepancies in the conclusions that several prior works reach, on questions such as the optimal token to parameter ratio. We augment this discussion with our own analysis of the critical impact that changes in specific details may effect in a scaling study, and the resulting altered conclusions. Additionally, we survey over 50 papers that study scaling trends: while 45 of these papers quantify these trends using a power law, most under-report crucial details needed to reproduce their findings. To mitigate this, we we propose a checklist for authors to consider while contributing to scaling law research.</description>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) empowers agents to associate time-sequenced visual observations with corresponding instructions to make sequential decisions. However, generalization remains a persistent challenge, particularly when dealing with visually diverse scenes or transitioning from simulated environments to real-world deployment. In this paper, we address the mismatch between human-centric instructions and quadruped robots with a low-height field of view, proposing a Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVNav) approach to mitigate this issue. This work represents the first attempt to highlight the generalization gap in VLN across varying heights of visual observation in realistic robot deployments. Our approach leverages weighted historical observations as enriched spatiotemporal contexts for instruction following, effectively managing feature collisions within cells by assigning appropriate weights to identical features across different viewpoints. This enables low-height robots to overcome challenges such as visual obstructions and perceptual mismatches. Additionally, we transfer the connectivity graph from the HM3D and Gibson datasets as an extra resource to enhance spatial priors and a more comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios, leading to improved performance and generalizability of the waypoint predictor in real-world environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Ground-level Viewpoint Navigation (GVnav) approach significantly improves performance in both simulated environments and real-world deployments with quadruped robots.</description>

      <title>IndicEval-XL: Bridging Linguistic Diversity in Code Generation Across Indic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation from natural language prompts, revolutionizing software development workflows. As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms, these models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development lifecycles. However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community. To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population. Our benchmark bridges these languages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation framework. This work is particularly significant given India's representation of one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages play in Indian society. IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward expanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation frameworks. By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to make AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers of various linguistic backgrounds. To facilitate further research and development in this direction, we make our dataset and evaluation benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL</description>

      <title>Isolating Language-Coding from Problem-Solving: Benchmarking LLMs with PseudoEval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing code generation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as HumanEval and MBPP are designed to study LLMs' end-to-end performance, where the benchmarks feed a problem description in natural language as input and examine the generated code in specific programming languages. However, the evaluation scores revealed in this way provide a little hint as to the bottleneck of the code generation -- whether LLMs are struggling with their problem-solving capability or language-coding capability. To answer this question, we construct PseudoEval, a multilingual code generation benchmark that provides a solution written in pseudocode as input. By doing so, the bottleneck of code generation in various programming languages could be isolated and identified. Our study yields several interesting findings. For example, we identify that the bottleneck of LLMs in Python programming is problem-solving, while Rust is struggling relatively more in language-coding. Also, our study indicates that problem-solving capability may transfer across programming languages, while language-coding needs more language-specific effort, especially for undertrained programming languages. Finally, we release the pipeline of constructing PseudoEval to facilitate the extension to existing benchmarks. PseudoEval is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PseudocodeACL25-7B74.</description>

      <title>FSPO: Few-Shot Preference Optimization of Synthetic Preference Data in LLMs Elicits Effective Personalization to Real Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective personalization of LLMs is critical for a broad range of user-interfacing applications such as virtual assistants and content curation. Inspired by the strong in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, we propose Few-Shot Preference Optimization (FSPO), which reframes reward modeling as a meta-learning problem. Under this framework, an LLM learns to quickly adapt to a user via a few labeled preferences from that user, constructing a personalized reward function for them. Additionally, since real-world preference data is scarce and challenging to collect at scale, we propose careful design choices to construct synthetic preference datasets for personalization, generating over 1M synthetic personalized preferences using publicly available LLMs. In particular, to successfully transfer from synthetic data to real users, we find it crucial for the data to exhibit both high diversity and coherent, self-consistent structure. We evaluate FSPO on personalized open-ended generation for up to 1,500 synthetic users across across three domains: movie reviews, pedagogical adaptation based on educational background, and general question answering, along with a controlled human study. Overall, FSPO achieves an 87% Alpaca Eval winrate on average in generating responses that are personalized to synthetic users and a 72% winrate with real human users in open-ended question answering.</description>

      <title>Residual Speech Embeddings for Tone Classification: Removing Linguistic Content to Enhance Paralinguistic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning models for speech processing, such as wav2vec2, HuBERT, WavLM, and Whisper, generate embeddings that capture both linguistic and paralinguistic information, making it challenging to analyze tone independently of spoken content. In this work, we introduce a method for disentangling paralinguistic features from linguistic content by regressing speech embeddings onto their corresponding text embeddings and using the residuals as a representation of vocal tone. We evaluate this approach across multiple self-supervised speech embeddings, demonstrating that residual embeddings significantly improve tone classification performance compared to raw speech embeddings. Our results show that this method enhances linear separability, enabling improved classification even with simple models such as logistic regression. Visualization of the residual embeddings further confirms the successful removal of linguistic information while preserving tone-related features. These findings highlight the potential of residual embeddings for applications in sentiment analysis, speaker characterization, and paralinguistic speech processing.</description>

      <title>TheoremExplainAgent: Towards Multimodal Explanations for LLM Theorem Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding domain-specific theorems often requires more than just text-based reasoning; effective communication through structured visual explanations is crucial for deeper comprehension. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance in text-based theorem reasoning, their ability to generate coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce TheoremExplainAgent, an agentic approach for generating long-form theorem explanation videos (over 5 minutes) using Manim animations. To systematically evaluate multimodal theorem explanations, we propose TheoremExplainBench, a benchmark covering 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines, along with 5 automated evaluation metrics. Our results reveal that agentic planning is essential for generating detailed long-form videos, and the o3-mini agent achieves a success rate of 93.8% and an overall score of 0.77. However, our quantitative and qualitative studies show that most of the videos produced exhibit minor issues with visual element layout. Furthermore, multimodal explanations expose deeper reasoning flaws that text-based explanations fail to reveal, highlighting the importance of multimodal explanations.</description>

      <title>Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</description>

      <title>ImageChain: Advancing Sequential Image-to-Text Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning over sequences of images remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent models incorporate multi-image data during pre-training, they still struggle to recognize sequential structures, often treating images independently. This work introduces ImageChain, a framework that enhances MLLMs with sequential reasoning capabilities over image data by modeling visual sequences as a multi-turn conversation. In ImageChain, images are interleaved with corresponding textual descriptions to form a controlled dialogue that explicitly captures temporal dependencies and narrative progression. Our method optimizes for the task of next-scene description, where the model generates a context-aware description of an upcoming scene based on preceding visual and textual cues. We demonstrate that our approach improves performance on the next-scene description task -- achieving an average improvement from 3.7% to 19% in SimRate, a metric that quantifies semantic similarity to human-annotated ground truths. Moreover, ImageChain achieves robust zero-shot out-of-domain performance in applications ranging from comics to robotics. Extensive experiments validate that instruction-tuning in a multimodal, multi-turn conversation design is key to bridging the gap between static image understanding and temporally-aware reasoning.</description>

      <title>Project Alexandria: Towards Freeing Scientific Knowledge from Copyright Burdens via LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We urge the community to adopt a new idea: convert scholarly documents into Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units: (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving math story problems is a complex task for students and NLP models alike, requiring them to understand the world as described in the story and reason over it to compute an answer. Recent years have seen impressive performance on automatically solving these problems with large pre-trained language models and innovative techniques to prompt them. However, it remains unclear if these models possess accurate representations of mathematical concepts. This leads to lack of interpretability and trustworthiness which impedes their usefulness in various applications. In this paper, we consolidate previous work on categorizing and representing math story problems and develop MathWorld, which is a graph-based semantic formalism specific for the domain of math story problems. With MathWorld, we can assign world models to math story problems which represent the situations and actions introduced in the text and their mathematical relationships. We combine math story problems from several existing datasets and annotate a corpus of 1,019 problems and 3,204 logical forms with MathWorld. Using this data, we demonstrate the following use cases of MathWorld: (1) prompting language models with synthetically generated question-answer pairs to probe their reasoning and world modeling abilities, and (2) generating new problems by using the world models as a design space.</description>

      <title>AfroBench: How Good are Large Language Models on African Languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale multilingual evaluations, such as MEGA, often include only a handful of African languages due to the scarcity of high-quality evaluation data and the limited discoverability of existing African datasets. This lack of representation hinders comprehensive LLM evaluation across a diverse range of languages and tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce AfroBench -- a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs across 64 African languages, 15 tasks and 22 datasets. AfroBench consists of nine natural language understanding datasets, six text generation datasets, six knowledge and question answering tasks, and one mathematical reasoning task. We present results comparing the performance of prompting LLMs to fine-tuned baselines based on BERT and T5-style models. Our results suggest large gaps in performance between high-resource languages, such as English, and African languages across most tasks; but performance also varies based on the availability of monolingual data resources. Our findings confirm that performance on African languages continues to remain a hurdle for current LLMs, underscoring the need for additional efforts to close this gap.

      <title>Permute-and-Flip: An optimally stable and watermarkable decoder for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys stability properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-stability tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson (2023)'s Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and its Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same stability (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for LLM decoding.

      <title>Can LLMs Solve longer Math Word Problems Better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14804v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Math Word Problems (MWPs) play a vital role in assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current research primarily focuses on questions with concise contexts. The impact of longer contexts on mathematical reasoning remains under-explored. This study pioneers the investigation of Context Length Generalizability (CoLeG), which refers to the ability of LLMs to solve MWPs with extended narratives. We introduce Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM), a collection of MWPs featuring lengthy narratives, and propose two novel metrics to evaluate the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in tackling these problems. Our analysis of existing zero-shot prompting techniques with proprietary LLMs along with open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in CoLeG. To alleviate these issues, we propose tailored approaches for different categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, we introduce a new instructional prompt designed to mitigate the impact of long contexts. For open-source LLMs, we develop a novel auxiliary task for fine-tuning to enhance CoLeG. Our comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing improved performance on E-GSM. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis to differentiate the effects of semantic understanding and reasoning efficacy, showing that our methods improves the latter. We also establish the generalizability of our methods across several other MWP benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs and offer practical solutions correspondingly, paving the way for further exploration of model generalizability and training methodologies.</description>

      <title>Expert-Token Resonance MoE: Bidirectional Routing with Efficiency Affinity-Driven Active Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach for large language models (LLMs), offering unprecedented computational efficiency. However, these architectures grapple with challenges of token distribution imbalance and expert homogenization, impeding optimal semantic generalization. We propose a novel expert routing framework that incorporates: (1) An efficient routing mechanism with lightweight computation. (2) An adaptive bidirectional selection mechanism leveraging resonance between experts and tokens. (3) A module that determines the lower bounds of expert capacity based on dynamic token distribution analysis, specifically designed to address drop-and-pad strategies. It is also integrated with orthogonal feature extraction module and an optimized loss function for expert localization. This framework effectively reduces expert homogeneity while enhancing the performance of the expert selection module. Additionally, we introduce a local expert strategy that simultaneously improves load balancing and reduces network communication overhead. It achieves a 40\% reduction in token processed by each expert without compromising model convergence or efficacy. When coupled with communication optimizations, the training efficiency improvements of 5.4\% to 46.6\% can be observed. After supervised fine-tuning, it exhibits performance gains of 9.7\% to 14.1\% across GDAD, GPQA, and TeleQnA benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Activation Steering: A Tuning-Free LLM Truthfulness Improvement Method for Diverse Hallucinations Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to consistently express it and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.

      <title>EMERGE: Enhancing Multimodal Electronic Health Records Predictive Modeling with Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data has significantly advanced clinical predictive capabilities. Existing models, which utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data, often fall short of incorporating the necessary medical context for accurate clinical tasks, while previous approaches with knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. In response, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data sparsity. EMERGE contributes to refining the utilization of multimodal EHR data in healthcare, bridging the gap with nuanced medical contexts essential for informed clinical predictions. We have publicly released the code at https://github.com/yhzhu99/EMERGE.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy and Practical AI for Healthcare: A Guided Deferral System with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a valuable technology for various applications in healthcare. However, their tendency to hallucinate and the existing reliance on proprietary systems pose challenges in environments concerning critical decision-making and strict data privacy regulations, such as healthcare, where the trust in such systems is paramount. Through combining the strengths and discounting the weaknesses of humans and AI, the field of Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC) presents one front for tackling these challenges and hence improving trust. This paper presents a novel HAIC guided deferral system that can simultaneously parse medical reports for disorder classification, and defer uncertain predictions with intelligent guidance to humans. We develop methodology which builds efficient, effective and open-source LLMs for this purpose, for the real-world deployment in healthcare. We conduct a pilot study which showcases the effectiveness of our proposed system in practice. Additionally, we highlight drawbacks of standard calibration metrics in imbalanced data scenarios commonly found in healthcare, and suggest a simple yet effective solution: the Imbalanced Expected Calibration Error.</description>

      <title>Knowledge in Superposition: Unveiling the Failures of Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to update outdated or incorrect knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, current knowledge editing methods have limited scalability for lifelong editing. This study explores the fundamental reason why knowledge editing fails in lifelong editing. We begin with the closed-form solution derived from linear associative memory, which underpins state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods. We extend the solution from single editing to lifelong editing, and through rigorous mathematical derivation, identify an interference term in the final solution, suggesting that editing knowledge may impact irrelevant knowledge. Further analysis of the interference term reveals a close relationship with superposition between knowledge representations. When knowledge superposition does not exist in language models, the interference term vanishes, allowing for lossless knowledge editing. Experiments across numerous language models reveal that knowledge superposition is universal, exhibiting high kurtosis, zero mean, and heavy-tailed distributions with clear scaling laws. Ultimately, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that knowledge superposition is the fundamental reason for the failure of lifelong editing. Moreover, this is the first study to investigate knowledge editing from the perspective of superposition and provides a comprehensive observation of superposition across numerous real-world language models.

      <title>Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation sparsity can enable practical inference speedups in large language models (LLMs) by reducing the compute and memory-movement required for matrix multiplications during the forward pass. However, existing methods face limitations that inhibit widespread adoption. Some approaches are tailored towards older models with ReLU-based sparsity, while others require extensive continued pre-training on up to hundreds of billions of tokens. This paper describes TEAL, a simple training-free method that applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model. TEAL achieves 40-50% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation across Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, with sizes varying from 7B to 70B. We improve existing sparse kernels and demonstrate wall-clock decoding speed-ups of up to 1.53$\times$ and 1.8$\times$ at 40% and 50% model-wide sparsity. TEAL is compatible with weight quantization, enabling further efficiency gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small language models (SLMs), despite their widespread adoption in modern smart devices, have received significantly less academic attention compared to their large language model (LLM) counterparts, which are predominantly deployed in data centers and cloud environments. While researchers continue to improve the capabilities of LLMs in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, SLM research aims to make machine intelligence more accessible, affordable, and efficient for everyday tasks. Focusing on transformer-based, decoder-only language models with 100M-5B parameters, we survey 70 state-of-the-art open-source SLMs, analyzing their technical innovations across three axes: architectures, training datasets, and training algorithms. In addition, we evaluate their capabilities in various domains, including commonsense reasoning, mathematics, in-context learning, and long context. To gain further insight into their on-device runtime costs, we benchmark their inference latency and memory footprints. Through in-depth analysis of our benchmarking data, we offer valuable insights to advance research in this field.</description>

      <title>HYBRIDMIND: Meta Selection of Natural Language and Symbolic Language for Enhanced LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19381v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs approach logical and mathematical reasoning through natural or symbolic languages. While natural language offers human-accessible flexibility but suffers from ambiguity, symbolic reasoning provides precise, machine-executable inferences at the cost of strict domain constraints. We introduce HYBRIDMIND, an adaptive strategy that selects the optimal reasoning approach for each reasoning problem. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate both prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs and fine-tuned open-source models. We find that fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct as a meta-selector outperforms GPT-4o's natural language reasoning by 4.4\% on FOLIO and 1.3\% on MATH. More notably, using GPT-3.5-turbo as a prompted meta-selector yields a 10\% improvement on FOLIO's challenging subset compared to GPT-4o. We will release our code and data to support future research.</description>

      <title>Better Instruction-Following Through Minimum Bayes Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02902v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-purpose LLM judges capable of human-level evaluation provide not only a scalable and accurate way of evaluating instruction-following LLMs but also new avenues for supervising and improving their performance. One promising way of leveraging LLM judges for supervision is through Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which uses a reference-based evaluator to select a high-quality output from amongst a set of candidate outputs. In the first part of this work, we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-time performance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding with reference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding, best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical and embedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistent across LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judges can be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain the improvements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, we explore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs. We find that self-training using Direct Preference Optimisation leads to significant performance gains, such that the self-trained models with greedy decoding generally match and sometimes exceed the performance of their base models with MBR decoding.</description>

      <title>Subtle Errors Matter: Preference Learning via Error-injected Self-editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation.</description>

      <title>From Exploration to Mastery: Enabling LLMs to Master Tools via Self-Driven Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tool learning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external environments by invoking tools, serving as an effective strategy to mitigate the limitations inherent in their pre-training data. In this process, tool documentation plays a crucial role by providing usage instructions for LLMs, thereby facilitating effective tool utilization. This paper concentrates on the critical challenge of bridging the comprehension gap between LLMs and external tools due to the inadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in existing human-centric tool documentation. We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trials emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools. This methodology pivots on an innovative trial-and-error approach, consisting of three distinct learning phases: experience gathering, learning from experience, and documentation rewriting, to iteratively enhance the tool documentation. This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding for Multilingual Self-improving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited "first-class" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZNLP/Language-Imbalance-Driven-Rewarding</description>

      <title>SuperCorrect: Advancing Small LLM Reasoning with Thought Template Distillation and Self-Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1, and ReasonFlux have shown significant improvements in various reasoning tasks. However, smaller LLMs still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct reasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues by enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges in independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract hierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student model by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This cross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and resolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model, breaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate our superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model significantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8%/5.3% and Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1%/6.3% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performance among all 7B models.

      <description>arXiv:2410.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing the adaptive capabilities of large language models is a critical pursuit in both research and application. Traditional fine-tuning methods require substantial data and computational resources, especially for enhancing specific capabilities, while in-context learning is limited by the need for appropriate demonstrations and efficient token usage. Inspired by the expression of in-context learned capabilities through task vectors and the concept of modularization, we propose \alg, a framework consisting of two modules designed to effectively store and reuse task vectors to elicit the diverse capabilities of models without additional training or inference tokens. Our comprehensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our pipeline is highly transferable across different input formats, tasks, and model architectures. ELICIT serves as a plug-and-play performance booster to enable adaptive elicitation of model capabilities. By externally storing and reusing vectors that represent in-context learned capabilities, \alg not only demonstrates the potential to operate modular capabilities but also significantly enhances the performance, versatility, adaptability, and scalability of large language models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ELICIT.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing scientific research, yet its growing integration into laboratory environments presents critical safety challenges. While large language models (LLMs) increasingly assist in tasks ranging from procedural guidance to autonomous experiment orchestration, an "illusion of understanding" may lead researchers to overestimate their reliability. Such overreliance is especially hazardous in high-stakes laboratory settings, where failures in hazard identification or risk assessment can result in severe accidents. To address these concerns, we propose the Laboratory Safety Benchmark (LabSafety Bench), a comprehensive framework that evaluates LLMs and vision language models (VLMs) on their ability to identify potential hazards, assess risks, and predict the consequences of unsafe actions in lab environments. LabSafety Bench comprises 765 multiple-choice questions aligned with US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) protocols, along with 520 realistic laboratory scenarios featuring dual evaluation tasks: the Hazards Identification Test and the Consequence Identification Test, with 4090 open-ended questions in total. Evaluations across eight proprietary models, seven open-weight LLMs, and four VLMs reveal that, despite advanced performance on structured assessments, no model achieves the safety threshold required for reliable operation. None scored above 75% on the Hazards Identification Test. Moreover, while proprietary models tend to excel in multiple-choice evaluations, their performance in open-ended, real-world scenario responses is comparable to that of open-source models. These findings underscore the urgent need for specialized evaluation frameworks to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AI in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Self-calibration for Language Model Quantization and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization and pruning are fundamental approaches for model compression, enabling efficient inference for language models. In a post-training setting, state-of-the-art quantization and pruning methods require calibration data, a small set of unlabeled examples. Conventionally, this is randomly sampled web text, aiming to reflect the model training data. However, this poses two key problems: (1) unrepresentative calibration examples can harm model performance, and (2) organizations increasingly avoid releasing model training data. In this paper, we propose self-calibration as a solution. Our approach requires no external data, instead leveraging the model itself to generate synthetic calibration data, with a view to better approximating the pre-training data distribution. We extensively compare the performance of self-calibration with several baselines, across a variety of models, compression methods, and tasks. Our approach proves consistently competitive in maximizing downstream task performance, frequently outperforming even using real data.</description>

      <title>On Many-Shot In-Context Learning for Long-Context Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-shot in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a unique setup to both utilize and test the ability of large language models to handle long context. This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark, MANYICLBENCH, to characterize model's ability on both fronts and benchmark 12 LCLMs using MANYICLBENCH. We find that while state-of-the-art models demonstrate good performance up to 64k tokens in SSL tasks, many models experience significant performance drops at only 16k tokens in ASL tasks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Neurolinguistic Subjects: Discrepancy in Performance and Competence for Form and Meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the linguistic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) regarding signifier (form) and signified (meaning) by distinguishing two LLM assessment paradigms: psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic. Traditional psycholinguistic evaluations often reflect statistical rules that may not accurately represent LLMs' true linguistic competence. We introduce a neurolinguistic approach, utilizing a novel method that combines minimal pair and diagnostic probing to analyze activation patterns across model layers. This method allows for a detailed examination of how LLMs represent form and meaning, and whether these representations are consistent across languages. We found: (1) Psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic methods reveal that language performance and competence are distinct; (2) Direct probability measurement may not accurately assess linguistic competence; (3) Instruction tuning won't change much competence but improve performance; (4) LLMs exhibit higher competence and performance in form compared to meaning. Additionally, we introduce new conceptual minimal pair datasets for Chinese (COMPS-ZH) and German (COMPS-DE), complementing existing English datasets.</description>

      <title>Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization for Implicit Model Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While fusing heterogeneous open-source LLMs with varying architectures and sizes can potentially integrate the strengths of different models, existing fusion methods face significant challenges, such as vocabulary alignment and merging distribution matrices. These procedures are not only complex but also prone to introducing noise and errors. In this paper, we propose an implicit fusion method, Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization (WRPO), which leverages preference optimization between the source LLMs and the target LLM to transfer their capabilities effectively. WRPO eliminates the need for vocabulary alignment and matrix fusion and can be efficiently scaled to accommodate various LLMs. To address distributional deviations between the source and target LLMs, WRPO introduces a progressive adaptation strategy that gradually shifts reliance on preferred examples from the target LLM to the source LLMs. Extensive experiments on the MT-Bench, AlpacaEval-2, and Arena-Hard benchmarks demonstrate that WRPO consistently outperforms existing knowledge fusion methods and various fine-tuning baselines. When applied to LLaMA3-8B-Instruct as the target model, WRPO achieves a length-controlled win rate of 55.9% against GPT-4-Preview-1106 on AlpacaEval-2 and a win rate of 46.2% against GPT-4-0314 on Arena-Hard. Our code is available at https://github.com/SLIT-AI/WRPO.</description>

      <title>The Hyperfitting Phenomenon: Sharpening and Stabilizing LLMs for Open-Ended Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.</description>

      <title>Mapping and Influencing the Political Ideology of Large Language Models using Synthetic Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of political biases in large language models (LLMs) has primarily examined these systems as single entities with fixed viewpoints. While various methods exist for measuring such biases, the impact of persona-based prompting on LLMs' political orientation remains unexplored. In this work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona descriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs using the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial compass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting towards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and left-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly cluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying degrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors. While all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian positions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions, suggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect inherent biases in model training.</description>

Abstract: In this era of technological advancements, several cutting-edge techniques are being implemented to enhance Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on improving safety, efficiency, and adaptability in complex driving environments. However, AD still faces some problems including performance limitations. To address this problem, we conducted an in-depth study on implementing the Multi-modal Large Language Model. We constructed a Virtual Question Answering (VQA) dataset to fine-tune the model and address problems with the poor performance of MLLM on AD. We then break down the AD decision-making process by scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. Chain of Thought has been used to make the decision more perfectly. Our experiments and detailed analysis of Autonomous Driving give an idea of how important MLLM is for AD.</description>

      <title>Multiple References with Meaningful Variations Improve Literary Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While a source sentence can be translated in many ways, most machine translation (MT) models are trained with only a single reference. Previous work has shown that using synthetic paraphrases can improve MT. This paper investigates best practices for employing multiple references by analyzing the semantic similarity among different English translations of world literature in the Par3 dataset. We classify the semantic similarity between paraphrases into three levels: low, medium, and high, and fine-tune three different models (mT5-large, LLaMA-2-7B, and Opus-MT) for literary MT tasks. Across different models, holding the total training instances constant, single-reference but more source texts only marginally outperforms multiple-reference with half of the source texts. Moreover, when fine-tuning an LLM, using paraphrases with medium and high semantic similarity outperforms an unfiltered dataset, with improvements in BLEU (0.3-0.5), COMET (0.1-0.9), and chrF++ (0.17-0.32).

      <title>TAPO: Task-Referenced Adaptation for Prompt Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt engineering can significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), with automated prompt optimization (APO) gaining significant attention due to the time-consuming and laborious nature of manual prompt design. However, much of the existing work in APO overlooks task-specific characteristics, resulting in prompts that lack domain specificity and are not well-suited for task-specific optimization. In this paper, we introduce TAPO, a multitask-aware prompt optimization framework composed of three key modules. First, a task-aware metric selection module is proposed to enhance task-specific prompt generation capabilities. Second, we present a multi-metrics evaluation module to jointly evaluate prompts from multiple perspectives. Third, an evolution-based optimization framework is introduced for automatic prompt refinement, which improves adaptability across various tasks. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Theme-Explanation Structure for Table Summarization using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Korean Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes the Theme-Explanation Structure-based Table Summarization (Tabular-TX) pipeline designed to process tabular data efficiently. Tabular-TX preprocesses tabular data by focusing on highlighted cells. It then generates summary sentences following a structured format, where the Theme Part appears as an adverbial phrase, and the Explanation Part follows as a predictive clause. This approach enables tailored analysis by considering the structural characteristics of tables and their comparability. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that require extensive labeled data and computational resources, our method leverages In-Context Learning to dynamically adapt to different table structures without additional training, ensuring efficient and scalable table interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tabular-TX significantly outperforms conventional fine-tuning-based methods, particularly in low-resource scenarios, by leveraging table structures and metadata more effectively through structured prompts. The results confirm that Tabular-TX enables more effective processing of complex tabular data. Furthermore, it serves as a viable alternative for table-based question answering and summarization tasks in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>ACEBench: Who Wins the Match Point in Tool Usage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12851v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in decision-making and reasoning, particularly when integrated with various tools to effectively solve complex problems. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' tool usage face several limitations: (1) limited evaluation scenarios, often lacking assessments in real multi-turn dialogue contexts; (2) narrow evaluation dimensions, with insufficient detailed assessments of how LLMs use tools; and (3) reliance on LLMs or real API executions for evaluation, which introduces significant overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce ACEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing tool usage in LLMs. ACEBench categorizes data into three primary types based on evaluation methodology: Normal, Special, and Agent. "Normal" evaluates tool usage in basic scenarios; "Special" evaluates tool usage in situations with ambiguous or incomplete instructions; "Agent" evaluates tool usage through multi-agent interactions to simulate real-world, multi-turn dialogues. We conducted extensive experiments using ACEBench, analyzing various LLMs in-depth and providing a more granular examination of error causes across different data types.</description>

      <title>R.I.P.: Better Models by Survival of the Fittest Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data quality is one of the most important drivers of final model quality. In this work, we introduce a method for evaluating data integrity based on the assumption that low-quality input prompts result in high variance and low quality responses. This is achieved by measuring the rejected response quality and the reward gap between the chosen and rejected preference pair. Our method, Rejecting Instruction Preferences (RIP) can be used to filter prompts from existing training sets, or to make high quality synthetic datasets, yielding large performance gains across various benchmarks compared to unfiltered data. Using Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct, RIP improves AlpacaEval2 LC Win Rate by 9.4%, Arena-Hard by 8.7%, and WildBench by 9.9%. Using Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct, RIP improves Arena-Hard from 67.5 to 82.9, which is from 18th place to 6th overall in the leaderboard.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Persona-based Political Perspectives on Hateful Content Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While pretraining language models with politically diverse content has been shown to improve downstream task fairness, such approaches require significant computational resources often inaccessible to many researchers and organizations. Recent work has established that persona-based prompting can introduce political diversity in model outputs without additional training. However, it remains unclear whether such prompting strategies can achieve results comparable to political pretraining for downstream tasks. We investigate this question using persona-based prompting strategies in multimodal hate-speech detection tasks, specifically focusing on hate speech in memes. Our analysis reveals that when mapping personas onto a political compass and measuring persona agreement, inherent political positioning has surprisingly little correlation with classification decisions. Notably, this lack of correlation persists even when personas are explicitly injected with stronger ideological descriptors. Our findings suggest that while LLMs can exhibit political biases in their responses to direct political questions, these biases may have less impact on practical classification tasks than previously assumed. This raises important questions about the necessity of computationally expensive political pretraining for achieving fair performance in downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simultaneous Speech-To-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Hibiki, a decoder-only model for simultaneous speech translation. Hibiki leverages a multistream language model to synchronously process source and target speech, and jointly produces text and audio tokens to perform speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation. We furthermore address the fundamental challenge of simultaneous interpretation, which unlike its consecutive counterpart, where one waits for the end of the source utterance to start translating, adapts its flow to accumulate just enough context to produce a correct translation in real-time, chunk by chunk. To do so, we introduce a weakly-supervised method that leverages the perplexity of an off-the-shelf text translation system to identify optimal delays on a per-word basis and create aligned synthetic data. After supervised training, Hibiki performs adaptive, simultaneous speech translation with vanilla temperature sampling. On a French-English simultaneous speech translation task, Hibiki demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in translation quality, speaker fidelity and naturalness. Moreover, the simplicity of its inference process makes it compatible with batched translation and even real-time on-device deployment. We provide examples as well as models and inference code.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of predicting an outcome using a short text for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama.
  We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs).
  In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.</description>

      <title>AttentionPredictor: Temporal Pattern Matters for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Group-Adaptive Threshold Optimization for Robust AI-Generated Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., {\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text. However, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for subgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles than open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification that disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and learns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of performance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and decreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework paves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated output detection.</description>

      <title>Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outliers have been widely observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly impacting model performance and posing challenges for model compression. Understanding the functionality and formation mechanisms of these outliers is critically important. Existing works, however, largely focus on reducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an in-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of outliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers-activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers-and analyze their distributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections between their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention mechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the mechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through theoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the self-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit context-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers stem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study not only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows that structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve model compression.

      <description>arXiv:2502.08279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transforming recorded videos into concise and accurate textual summaries is a growing challenge in multimodal learning. This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of scientific video summarization.</description>

      <title>Akan Cinematic Emotions (ACE): A Multimodal Multi-party Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Movie Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Akan Conversation Emotion (ACE) dataset, the first multimodal emotion dialogue dataset for an African language, addressing the significant lack of resources for low-resource languages in emotion recognition research. ACE, developed for the Akan language, contains 385 emotion-labeled dialogues and 6,162 utterances across audio, visual, and textual modalities, along with word-level prosodic prominence annotations. The presence of prosodic labels in this dataset also makes it the first prosodically annotated African language dataset. We demonstrate the quality and utility of ACE through experiments using state-of-the-art emotion recognition methods, establishing solid baselines for future research. We hope ACE inspires further work on inclusive, linguistically and culturally diverse NLP resources.</description>

Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, Fin-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including Fin-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.</description>

      <title>ChineseSimpleVQA -- "See the World, Discover Knowledge": A Chinese Factuality Evaluation for Large Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of factual accuracy in large vision language models (LVLMs) has lagged behind their rapid development, making it challenging to fully reflect these models' knowledge capacity and reliability. In this paper, we introduce the first factuality-based visual question-answering benchmark in Chinese, named ChineseSimpleVQA, aimed at assessing the visual factuality of LVLMs across 8 major topics and 56 subtopics. The key features of this benchmark include a focus on the Chinese language, diverse knowledge types, a multi-hop question construction, high-quality data, static consistency, and easy-to-evaluate through short answers. Moreover, we contribute a rigorous data construction pipeline and decouple the visual factuality into two parts: seeing the world (i.e., object recognition) and discovering knowledge. This decoupling allows us to analyze the capability boundaries and execution mechanisms of LVLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate 34 advanced open-source and closed-source models, revealing critical performance gaps within this field.</description>

      <title>Exploring Translation Mechanism of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in multilingual translation tasks. However, the inherent translation mechanisms of LLMs remain poorly understood, largely due to sophisticated architectures and vast parameter scales. In response to this issue, this study explores the translation mechanism of LLM from the perspective of computational components (e.g., attention heads and MLPs). Path patching is utilized to explore causal relationships between components, detecting those crucial for translation tasks and subsequently analyzing their behavioral patterns in human-interpretable terms. Comprehensive analysis reveals that translation is predominantly facilitated by a sparse subset of specialized attention heads (less than 5\%), which extract source language, indicator, and positional features. MLPs subsequently integrate and process these features by transiting towards English-centric latent representations. Notably, building on the above findings, targeted fine-tuning of only 64 heads achieves translation improvement comparable to full-parameter tuning while preserving general capabilities.</description>

      <title>Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude: Adaptive Reasoning for Mathematical Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.</description>

      <title>UniGenCoder: Merging Seq2Seq and Seq2Tree Paradigms for Unified Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based code generation has completely transformed the way developers write programs today. Existing approaches to code generation have focused either on the Sequence-to-Sequence paradigm, which generates target code as a sequence of tokens, or the Sequence-to-Tree paradigm, which outputs code as a sequence of actions. While these two paradigms are intuitively complementary, their combination has not been previously explored. By comparing the code generated under these two paradigms, we find that integrating them holds significant potential. In this paper, we propose UniGenCoder for code-related generation tasks, which consists of a shared encoder, a shared decoder with a minimal set of additional parameters to unify two paradigms, and a selector that dynamically chooses optimal paradigm for each instance. Also, during the model training, we first perform the multi-task learning and distillation strategies to facilitate knowledge transfer between two paradigms, and then leverage contrastive learning to train the selector. Experimental results on the text-to-code and code-to-code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We release our code at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/UniGenCoder.</description>

      <title>MKE-Coder: Multi-Axial Knowledge with Evidence Verification in ICD Coding for Chinese EMRs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of automatically coding the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the medical field has been well-established and has received much attention. Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits significant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese EMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.</description>

Abstract: Unlearning aims to remove copyrighted, sensitive, or private content from large language models (LLMs) without a full retraining. In this work, we develop a multi-task unlearning benchmark (LUME) which features three tasks: (1) unlearn synthetically generated creative short novels, (2) unlearn synthetic biographies with sensitive information, and (3) unlearn a collection of public biographies. We further release two fine-tuned LLMs of 1B and 7B parameter sizes as the target models. We conduct detailed evaluations of several recently proposed unlearning algorithms and present results on carefully crafted metrics to understand their behavior and limitations.</description>

      <title>Pub-Guard-LLM: Detecting Fraudulent Biomedical Articles with Reliable Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant and growing number of published scientific articles is found to involve fraudulent practices, posing a serious threat to the credibility and safety of research in fields such as medicine. We propose Pub-Guard-LLM, the first large language model-based system tailored to fraud detection of biomedical scientific articles. We provide three application modes for deploying Pub-Guard-LLM: vanilla reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multi-agent debate. Each mode allows for textual explanations of predictions. To assess the performance of our system, we introduce an open-source benchmark, PubMed Retraction, comprising over 11K real-world biomedical articles, including metadata and retraction labels. We show that, across all modes, Pub-Guard-LLM consistently surpasses the performance of various baselines and provides more reliable explanations, namely explanations which are deemed more relevant and coherent than those generated by the baselines when evaluated by multiple assessment methods. By enhancing both detection performance and explainability in scientific fraud detection, Pub-Guard-LLM contributes to safeguarding research integrity with a novel, effective, open-source tool.</description>

      <title>ExpliCa: Evaluating Explicit Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks requiring interpretive and inferential accuracy. In this paper, we introduce ExpliCa, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs in explicit causal reasoning. ExpliCa uniquely integrates both causal and temporal relations presented in different linguistic orders and explicitly expressed by linguistic connectives. The dataset is enriched with crowdsourced human acceptability ratings. We tested LLMs on ExpliCa through prompting and perplexity-based metrics. We assessed seven commercial and open-source LLMs, revealing that even top models struggle to reach 0.80 accuracy. Interestingly, models tend to confound temporal relations with causal ones, and their performance is also strongly influenced by the linguistic order of the events. Finally, perplexity-based scores and prompting performance are differently affected by model size.</description>

      <title>Automatic Detection of Research Values from Scientific Abstracts Across Computer Science Subfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Computer science (CS) has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, providing computational tools and methodologies to various fields and forming new interdisciplinary communities. This growth in CS has significantly impacted institutional practices and relevant research communities. Therefore, it is crucial to explore what specific research values, known as basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate research attitudes or actions, CS-related research communities promote. Prior research has manually analyzed research values from a small sample of machine learning papers. No prior work has studied the automatic detection of research values in CS from large-scale scientific texts across different research subfields. This paper introduces a detailed annotation scheme featuring ten research values that guide CS-related research. Based on the scheme, we build value classifiers to scale up the analysis and present a systematic study over 226,600 paper abstracts from 32 CS-related subfields and 86 popular publishing venues over ten years.</description>

      <title>Make LoRA Great Again: Boosting LoRA with Adaptive Singular Values and Mixture-of-Experts Optimization Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs), its performance often falls short of Full Fine-Tuning (Full FT). Current methods optimize LoRA by initializing with static singular value decomposition (SVD) subsets, leading to suboptimal leveraging of pre-trained knowledge. Another path for improving LoRA is incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. However, weight misalignment and complex gradient dynamics make it challenging to adopt SVD prior to the LoRA MoE architecture. To mitigate these issues, we propose \underline{G}reat L\underline{o}R\underline{A} Mixture-of-Exper\underline{t} (GOAT), a framework that (1) adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, and (2) aligns optimization with full fine-tuned MoE by deriving a theoretical scaling factor. We demonstrate that proper scaling, without modifying the architecture or training algorithms, boosts LoRA MoE's efficiency and performance. Experiments across 25 datasets, including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, image classification, and natural language generation, demonstrate GOAT's state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT.</description>

      <title>SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition with Uninterrupted Retention and Low-Rank Adaptation in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models has become increasingly impractical due to the high computational demands. Additionally, FT can lead to catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed, which fine-tunes only a small subset of parameters, achieving similar performance to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting remains.
  To address these challenges, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) variant that mitigates catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a new normalization technique, SigNorm, to enhance parameter retention and overall performance.
  SECURA has been evaluated on a variety of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), challenging question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results show that SECURA achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks and a 2.51% improvement across five question-answering (QA) tasks on models such as Gemma2 2b, Qwen2 1.5b, Qwen 2 7b, Llama3 8b, and Llama3.1 8b, compared to DoRA. Moreover, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, maintaining more than 70% accuracy on basic LLM knowledge across 16 continual learning tests, outperforming Experience Replay (ER), Sequential Learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.</description>

      <title>Combining TF-GridNet and Mixture Encoder for Continuous Speech Separation for Meeting Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-life applications of automatic speech recognition (ASR) require processing of overlapped speech. A common method involves first separating the speech into overlap-free streams on which ASR is performed. Recently, TF-GridNet has shown impressive performance in speech separation in real reverberant conditions. Furthermore, a mixture encoder was proposed that leverages the mixed speech to mitigate the effect of separation artifacts. In this work, we extended the mixture encoder from a static two-speaker scenario to a natural meeting context featuring an arbitrary number of speakers and varying degrees of overlap. We further demonstrate its limits by the integration with separators of varying strength including TF-GridNet. Our experiments result in a new state-of-the-art performance on LibriCSS using a single microphone. They show that TF-GridNet largely closes the gap between previous methods and oracle separation independent of mixture encoding. We further investigate the remaining potential for improvement.</description>

      <title>SynGhost: Invisible and Universal Task-agnostic Backdoor Attack via Syntactic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although pre-training achieves remarkable performance, it suffers from task-agnostic backdoor attacks due to vulnerabilities in data and training mechanisms. These attacks can transfer backdoors to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filter that mitigates such risks. To overcome the limitations of manual target setting and explicit triggers, we propose $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an invisible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack via syntactic transfer, further exposing vulnerabilities in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ injects multiple syntactic backdoors into the pre-training space through corpus poisoning, while preserving the PLM's pre-training capabilities. Second, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ adaptively selects optimal targets based on contrastive learning, creating a uniform distribution in the pre-training space. To identify syntactic differences, we also introduce an awareness module to minimize interference between backdoors. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ poses significant threats and can transfer to various downstream tasks. Furthermore, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ resists defenses based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$.

      <title>NeuroVoz: a Castillian Spanish corpus of parkinsonian speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The screening of Parkinson's Disease (PD) through speech is hindered by a notable lack of publicly available datasets in different languages. This fact limits the reproducibility and further exploration of existing research.
  To address this gap, this manuscript presents the NeuroVoz corpus consisting of 112 native Castilian-Spanish speakers, including 58 healthy controls and 54 individuals with PD, all recorded in ON state. The corpus showcases a diverse array of speech tasks: sustained vowels; diadochokinetic tests; 16 Listen-and-Repeat utterances; and spontaneous monologues.
  The dataset is also complemented with subjective assessments of voice quality performed by an expert according to the GRBAS scale (Grade/Roughness/Breathiness/Asthenia/Strain), as well as annotations with a thorough examination of phonation quality, intensity, speed, resonance, intelligibility, and prosody.
  The corpus offers a substantial resource for the exploration of the impact of PD on speech. This data set has already supported several studies, achieving a benchmark accuracy of 89% for the screening of PD. Despite these advances, the broader challenge of conducting a language-agnostic, cross-corpora analysis of Parkinsonian speech patterns remains open.</description>

      <title>AiSAQ: All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization for DRAM-free Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms work effectively against large-scale vector retrieval. Among such methods, DiskANN achieves good recall-speed tradeoffs using both DRAM and storage. DiskANN adopts product quantization (PQ) to reduce memory usage, which is still proportional to the scale of datasets. In this paper, we propose All-in-Storage ANNS with Product Quantization (AiSAQ), which offloads compressed vectors to the SSD index. Our method achieves $\sim$10 MB memory usage in query search with billion-scale datasets without critical latency degradation. AiSAQ also reduces the index load time for query search preparation, which enables fast switch between muitiple billion-scale indices.This method can be applied to retrievers of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and be scaled out with multiple-server systems for emerging datasets. Our DiskANN-based implementation is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition excels at transcending sensory input and forming latent representations that structure our understanding of the world. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce chain-of-thought reasoning, they lack a principled framework to capture latent structures and model uncertainty, especially in compositional reasoning tasks. We propose Verbalized Probabilistic Graphical Modeling (vPGM), a Bayesian prompting framework that guides LLMs to simulate key principles of Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) in natural language. Unlike many traditional probabilistic methods requiring substantial domain expertise or specialized training, vPGM bypasses expert-driven model design, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited assumptions or scarce data. We evaluated our model on several compositional reasoning tasks, both close-ended and open-ended. Our results indicate that the model effectively enhances confidence calibration and text generation quality.</description>

      <title>GraCoRe: Benchmarking Graph Comprehension and Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the graph comprehension and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging and often incomplete. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on pure graph understanding, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across all graph types and detailed capability definitions. This paper presents GraCoRe, a benchmark for systematically assessing LLMs' graph comprehension and reasoning. GraCoRe uses a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy to categorize and test models on pure graph and heterogeneous graphs, subdividing capabilities into 10 distinct areas tested through 19 tasks. Our benchmark includes 11 datasets with 5,140 graphs of varying complexity. We evaluate four closed-source and eight open-source LLMs, conducting thorough analyses from both ability and task perspectives. Key findings reveal that OpenAI o1 model has amazing comprehension and reasoning capabilities, semantic enrichment enhances reasoning performance, node ordering impacts task success, and the ability to process longer texts does not necessarily improve graph comprehension or reasoning.GraCoRe is open-sourced at https://github.com/ZIKEYUAN/GraCoRe</description>

      <title>Threshold Filtering Packing for Supervised Fine-Tuning: Training Related Samples within Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Packing for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in autoregressive models involves concatenating data points of varying lengths until reaching the designed maximum length to facilitate GPU processing. However, randomly concatenating data points can lead to cross-contamination of sequences due to the significant difference in their subject matter. The mainstream approaches in SFT ensure that each token in the attention calculation phase only focuses on tokens within its own short sequence, without providing additional learning signals for the preceding context. To address these challenges, we introduce Threshold Filtering Packing (TFP), a method that selects samples with related context while maintaining sufficient diversity within the same pack. Our experiments show that TFP offers a simple-to-implement and scalable approach that significantly enhances SFT performance, with observed improvements of up to 7\% on GSM8K, 4\% on HumanEval. Furthermore, results from bias benchmark datasets highlight TFP's promising performance in improving fairness while also boosting prediction accuracy by 15\%.</description>

      <title>Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%. The code is available at https://github.com/HArmonizedSS/HASS.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Defences against Unsafe Feedback in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety guards can easily be removed when fine tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets. While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is harmful, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces via generating harmful text and optimize for reward that violates safety constraints indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both "implict" and "explicit" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RLHF setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more defence research. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing "harmless reward hacking" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.</description>

      <title>ColaCare: Enhancing Electronic Health Record Modeling through Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ColaCare, a framework that enhances Electronic Health Record (EHR) modeling through multi-agent collaboration driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach seamlessly integrates domain-specific expert models with LLMs to bridge the gap between structured EHR data and text-based reasoning. Inspired by the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) approach used in clinical settings, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgents and a MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the MDT-driven collaborative consultation framework. The MetaAgent orchestrates the discussion, facilitating consultations and evidence-based debates among DoctorAgents, simulating diverse expertise in clinical decision-making. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for medical evidence support, addressing the challenge of knowledge currency. Extensive experiments conducted on three EHR datasets demonstrate ColaCare's superior performance in clinical mortality outcome and readmission prediction tasks, underscoring its potential to revolutionize clinical decision support systems and advance personalized precision medicine. All code, case studies and a questionnaire are available at the project website: https://colacare.netlify.app.</description>

      <title>Efficient Inference for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5x speedup under relaxed sampling verification.

      <title>AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFlow, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFlow's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFlow enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars. The code is available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Approximations: A Novel Pruning Approach for Attention Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in enhancing various aspects of our daily lives, from conversational AI to search and AI assistants. However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear pruning approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs, which is beyond the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e., SparseGPT and Wanda, by a large margin. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Stronger Models are NOT Stronger Teachers for Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models (LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting instruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction datasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged as an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality instructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or stronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply adopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. In this paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensive experiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that larger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller models. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observe that existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response generators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models being fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named as Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response generators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR outperforms almost all baselines.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Generalization and Adaptation Ability of Machine-Generated Text Detectors in Academic Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rising popularity of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about machine-generated text (MGT), particularly in academic settings, where issues like plagiarism and misinformation are prevalent. As a result, developing a highly generalizable and adaptable MGT detection system has become an urgent priority. Given that LLMs are most commonly misused in academic writing, this work investigates the generalization and adaptation capabilities of MGT detectors in three key aspects specific to academic writing: First, we construct MGT-Acedemic, a large-scale dataset comprising over 336M tokens and 749K samples. MGT-Acedemic focuses on academic writing, featuring human-written texts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with an extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we benchmark the performance of various detectors for binary classification and attribution tasks in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. This benchmark reveals the often-overlooked challenges of attribution tasks. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models have to adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data in both few-shot and many-shot scenarios. We implement eight different adapting techniques to improve the performance and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization and adaptation ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems. The code framework is available at https://github.com/Y-L-LIU/MGTBench-2.0.</description>

      <title>Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, eroding trust, exacerbating inequality, and amplifying harmful narratives. Detecting fake news in multimodal contexts -- where deceptive content combines text and images -- is particularly challenging due to the nuanced interplay between modalities. Existing multimodal fake news detection methods often emphasize cross-modal consistency but ignore the complex interactions between text and visual elements, which may complement, contradict, or independently influence the predicted veracity of a post. To address these challenges, we present Modality Interactive Mixture-of-Experts for Fake News Detection (MIMoE-FND), a novel hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts framework designed to enhance multimodal fake news detection by explicitly modeling modality interactions through an interaction gating mechanism. Our approach models modality interactions by evaluating two key aspects of modality interactions: unimodal prediction agreement and semantic alignment. The hierarchical structure of MIMoE-FND allows for distinct learning pathways tailored to different fusion scenarios, adapting to the unique characteristics of each modality interaction. By tailoring fusion strategies to diverse modality interaction scenarios, MIMoE-FND provides a more robust and nuanced approach to multimodal fake news detection. We evaluate our approach on three real-world benchmarks spanning two languages, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. By enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of fake news detection, MIMoE-FND offers a promising tool to mitigate the spread of misinformation, with the potential to better safeguard vulnerable communities against its harmful effects.</description>

      <title>Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</description>

      <title>MIR-Bench: Benchmarking LLM's Long-Context Intelligence via Many-Shot In-Context Inductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inductive Reasoning (IR), the ability to summarize rules from examples and apply on new ones, has long been viewed as a primal ability for general intelligence and widely studied by cognitive science and AI researchers. Many benchmarks have been proposed to measure such ability for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, they focus on few-shot (usually $&lt;$10) setting and lack evaluation for aggregating many pieces of information from long contexts. On the other hand, the ever-growing context length of LLMs have brought forth the novel paradigm of many-shot In-Context Learning (ICL), which addresses new tasks with hundreds to thousands of examples without expensive and inefficient fine-tuning. However, many-shot evaluations are mostly focused on classification (a very limited aspect of IR), and popular long-context LLM tasks such as Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) seldom require complicated intelligence for integrating many pieces of information. To fix the issues from both worlds, we propose MIR-Bench, the first many-shot in-context inductive reasoning benchmark that asks LLM to induce output via input-output examples from underlying functions with diverse data format. Based on MIR-Bench, we study many novel problems for inductive reasoning and many-shot ICL, including robustness against erroneous shots and the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and acquired insightful findings.</description>

      <title>GenAI vs. Human Fact-Checkers: Accurate Ratings, Flawed Rationales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in understanding the capabilities and limits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models, we are just beginning to understand their capacity to assess and reason about the veracity of content. We evaluate multiple GenAI models across tasks that involve the rating of, and perceived reasoning about, the credibility of information. The information in our experiments comes from content that subnational U.S. politicians post to Facebook. We find that GPT-4o, one of the most used AI models in consumer applications, outperforms other models, but all models exhibit only moderate agreement with human coders. Importantly, even when GenAI models accurately identify low-credibility content, their reasoning relies heavily on linguistic features and ``hard'' criteria, such as the level of detail, source reliability, and language formality, rather than an understanding of veracity. We also assess the effectiveness of summarized versus full content inputs, finding that summarized content holds promise for improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. While GenAI has the potential to support human fact-checkers in scaling misinformation detection, our results caution against relying solely on these models.</description>

      <title>InductionBench: LLMs Fail in the Simplest Complexity Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable improvements in reasoning and many existing benchmarks have been addressed by models such as o1 and o3 either fully or partially. However, a majority of these benchmarks emphasize deductive reasoning, including mathematical and coding tasks in which rules such as mathematical axioms or programming syntax are clearly defined, based on which LLMs can plan and apply these rules to arrive at a solution. In contrast, inductive reasoning, where one infers the underlying rules from observed data, remains less explored. Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced models available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities. Coda and data are available https://github.com/Wenyueh/inductive_reasoning_benchmark.</description>

      <title>SparseTransX: Efficient Training of Translation-Based Knowledge Graph Embeddings Using Sparse Matrix Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank and Sparse Model Merging for Multi-Lingual Speech Recognition and Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language diversity presents a significant challenge in speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, such as automatic speech recognition and translation. Traditional multi-task training approaches aim to address this by jointly optimizing multiple speech recognition and translation tasks across various languages. While models like Whisper, built on these strategies, demonstrate strong performance, they still face issues of high computational cost, language interference, suboptimal training configurations, and limited extensibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LoRS-Merging (low-rank and sparse model merging), a novel technique designed to efficiently integrate models trained on different languages or tasks while preserving performance and reducing computational overhead. LoRS-Merging combines low-rank and sparse pruning to retain essential structures while eliminating redundant parameters, mitigating language and task interference, and enhancing extensibility. Experimental results across a range of languages demonstrate that LoRS-Merging reduces the word error rate by 10% and improves BLEU scores by 4% compared to conventional multi-lingual multi-task training baselines. Our findings suggest that model merging, particularly LoRS-Merging, is a scalable and effective complement to traditional multi-lingual training strategies for S2T applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</description>

      <title>ECG-Expert-QA: A Benchmark for Evaluating Medical Large Language Models in Heart Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ECG-Expert-QA, a comprehensive multimodal dataset designed for evaluating diagnostic capabilities in ECG interpretation, integrating real clinical data with systematically generated synthetic cases. The dataset encompasses six fundamental diagnostic tasks, comprising 47,211 meticulously curated question-answer pairs that span a spectrum of clinical scenarios, from basic rhythm analysis to complex case interpretation. By simulating challenging clinical cases through a rigorous medical knowledge-guided process, ECG-Expert-QA not only enhances the availability of annotated diagnostic data but also significantly increases the complexity and diversity of clinical presentations, including rare cardiac conditions and temporal progression patterns. This design enables comprehensive evaluation of medical language models across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, clinical reasoning, and knowledge integration. To facilitate global research collaboration, ECG-Expert-QA is available in both Chinese and English versions, with rigorous quality control ensuring linguistic and clinical consistency. The dataset's challenging diagnostic tasks, which include interpretation of complex arrhythmias, identification of subtle ischemic changes, and integration of clinical context, establish it as an effective benchmark for advancing AI-assisted ECG interpretation and pushing the boundaries of current diagnostic models. Our dataset is open-source and available at https://github.com/Zaozzz/ECG-Expert-QA</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Controlled Image Editing via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of image generation, achieving precise control over generated content and maintaining semantic consistency remain significant limitations, particularly concerning grounding techniques and the necessity for model fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Citrus: Leveraging Expert Cognitive Pathways in a Medical Language Model for Advanced Medical Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities, have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential across a wide range of applications. However, their deployment in healthcare, especially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of acquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a medical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI reasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is trained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data, synthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making pathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the complex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for medical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a custom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution aims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations using authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical reasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior performance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight Citrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems, providing a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.</description>
