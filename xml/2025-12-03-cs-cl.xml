      <title>Text Annotation via Inductive Coding: Comparing Human Experts to LLMs in Qualitative Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the automation of qualitative data analysis, focusing on inductive coding using large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that rely on deductive methods with predefined labels, this research investigates the inductive process where labels emerge from the data. The study evaluates the performance of six open-source LLMs compared to human experts. As part of the evaluation, experts rated the perceived difficulty of the quotes they coded. The results reveal a peculiar dichotomy: human coders consistently perform well when labeling complex sentences but struggle with simpler ones, while LLMs exhibit the opposite trend. Additionally, the study explores systematic deviations in both human and LLM generated labels by comparing them to the golden standard from the test set. While human annotations may sometimes differ from the golden standard, they are often rated more favorably by other humans. In contrast, some LLMs demonstrate closer alignment with the true labels but receive lower evaluations from experts.</description>

      <title>Emergent Convergence in Multi-Agent LLM Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative settings, yet little is known about how they coordinate when treated as black-box agents. We simulate 7500 multi-agent, multi-round discussions in an inductive coding task, generating over 125000 utterances that capture both final annotations and their interactional histories. We introduce process-level metrics: code stability, semantic self-consistency, and lexical confidence alongside sentiment and convergence measures, to track coordination dynamics. To probe deeper alignment signals, we analyze the evolving geometry of output embeddings, showing that intrinsic dimensionality declines over rounds, suggesting semantic compression. The results reveal that LLM groups converge lexically and semantically, develop asymmetric influence patterns, and exhibit negotiation-like behaviors despite the absence of explicit role prompting. This work demonstrates how black-box interaction analysis can surface emergent coordination strategies, offering a scalable complement to internal probe-based interpretability methods.</description>

      <title>Tree Matching Networks for Natural Language Inference: Parameter-Efficient Semantic Understanding via Dependency Parse Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In creating sentence embeddings for Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks, using transformer-based models like BERT leads to high accuracy, but require hundreds of millions of parameters. These models take in sentences as a sequence of tokens, and learn to encode the meaning of the sequence into embeddings such that those embeddings can be used reliably for NLI tasks. Essentially, every word is considered against every other word in the sequence, and the transformer model is able to determine the relationships between them, entirely from scratch. However, a model that accepts explicit linguistic structures like dependency parse trees may be able to leverage prior encoded information about these relationships, without having to learn them from scratch, thus improving learning efficiency. To investigate this, we adapt Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to operate on dependency parse trees, creating Tree Matching Networks (TMN). We compare TMN to a BERT based model on the SNLI entailment task and on the SemEval similarity task. TMN is able to achieve significantly better results with a significantly reduced memory footprint and much less training time than the BERT based model on the SNLI task, while both models struggled to preform well on the SemEval. Explicit structural representations significantly outperform sequence-based models at comparable scales, but current aggregation methods limit scalability. We propose multi-headed attention aggregation to address this limitation.</description>

      <title>Towards Corpus-Grounded Agentic LLMs for Multilingual Grammatical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical grammar research has become increasingly data-driven, but the systematic analysis of annotated corpora still requires substantial methodological and technical effort. We explore how agentic large language models (LLMs) can streamline this process by reasoning over annotated corpora and producing interpretable, data-grounded answers to linguistic questions. We introduce an agentic framework for corpus-grounded grammatical analysis that integrates concepts such as natural-language task interpretation, code generation, and data-driven reasoning. As a proof of concept, we apply it to Universal Dependencies (UD) corpora, testing it on multilingual grammatical tasks inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS). The evaluation spans 13 word-order features and over 170 languages, assessing system performance across three complementary dimensions - dominant-order accuracy, order-coverage completeness, and distributional fidelity - which reflect how well the system generalizes, identifies, and quantifies word-order variations. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combining LLM reasoning with structured linguistic data, offering a first step toward interpretable, scalable automation of corpus-based grammatical inquiry.</description>

      <title>Minimal-Edit Instruction Tuning for Low-Resource Indic GEC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grammatical error correction for Indic languages faces limited supervision, diverse scripts, and rich morphology. We propose an augmentation-free setup that uses instruction-tuned large language models and conservative decoding. A 12B GEMMA 3 model is instruction-tuned in bnb 4-bit precision with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and Alpaca-style formatting. Decoding follows a deterministic, constraint-aware procedure with a lightweight normaliser that encourages minimal, meaning-preserving edits. We operationalise inference, subsequent to instruction fine-tuning (IFT), via a fixed, language-specific prompt directly synthesised from a deterministic error classifier's taxonomy, label distributions, and precedence ordering computed on the training corpus.
  Under the official untuned GLEU evaluation, the system scores 92.41 on Malayalam, sixth overall, and 81.44 on Hindi, third overall. These results indicate that classifier-informed prompt design, adapter-based instruction tuning, and deterministic decoding provide a reproducible and a computationally efficient alternative to augmentation-centred pipelines for Indic GEC. The approach also motivates future work on stronger morphosyntactic constraints and human-centred evaluation of conservative edits.</description>

      <title>OmniFusion: Simultaneous Multilingual Multimodal Translations via Modular Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant progress in open-source text-only translation large language models (LLMs) with better language coverage and quality. However, these models can be only used in cascaded pipelines for speech translation (ST), performing automatic speech recognition first followed by translation. This introduces additional latency, which is particularly critical in simultaneous ST (SimulST), and prevents the model from exploiting multimodal context, such as images, which can aid disambiguation. Pretrained multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) already possess strong perception and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities, but generally lack the multilingual coverage and specialized translation performance of dedicated translation LLMs. To build an effective multimodal translation system, we propose an end-to-end approach that fuses MMFMs with translation LLMs. We introduce a novel fusion strategy that connects hidden states from multiple layers of a pretrained MMFM to a translation LLM, enabling joint end-to-end training. The resulting model, OmniFusion, built on Omni 2.5-7B as the MMFM and SeedX PPO-7B as the translation LLM, can perform speech-to-text, speech-and-image-to-text, and text-and-image-to-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that OmniFusion effectively leverages both audio and visual inputs, achieves a 1-second latency reduction in SimulST compared to cascaded pipelines and also improves the overall translation quality\footnote{Code is available at https://github.com/saikoneru/OmniFusion}.</description>

      <title>Lost without translation -- Can transformer (language models) understand mood states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Large Language Models show promise in psychiatry but are English-centric. Their ability to understand mood states in other languages is unclear, as different languages have their own idioms of distress. Aim: To quantify the ability of language models to faithfully represent phrases (idioms of distress) of four distinct mood states (depression, euthymia, euphoric mania, dysphoric mania) expressed in Indian languages. Methods: We collected 247 unique phrases for the four mood states across 11 Indic languages. We tested seven experimental conditions, comparing k-means clustering performance on: (a) direct embeddings of native and Romanised scripts (using multilingual and Indic-specific models) and (b) embeddings of phrases translated to English and Chinese. Performance was measured using a composite score based on Adjusted Rand Index, Normalised Mutual Information, Homogeneity and Completeness. Results: Direct embedding of Indic languages failed to cluster mood states (Composite Score = 0.002). All translation-based approaches showed significant improvement. High performance was achieved using Gemini-translated English (Composite=0.60) and human-translated English (Composite=0.61) embedded with gemini-001. Surprisingly, human-translated English, further translated into Chinese and embedded with a Chinese model, performed best (Composite = 0.67). Specialised Indic models (IndicBERT and Sarvam-M) performed poorly. Conclusion: Current models cannot meaningfully represent mood states directly from Indic languages, posing a fundamental barrier to their psychiatric application for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in India. While high-quality translation bridges this gap, reliance on proprietary models or complex translation pipelines is unsustainable. Models must first be built to understand diverse local languages to be effective in global mental health.</description>

      <title>EduEval: A Hierarchical Cognitive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Chinese Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for educational applications. However, their unscrutinized deployment poses risks to educational standards, underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation. We introduce EduEval, a comprehensive hierarchical benchmark for evaluating LLMs in Chinese K-12 education. This benchmark makes three key contributions: (1) Cognitive Framework: We propose the EduAbility Taxonomy, which unifies Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth of Knowledge to organize tasks across six cognitive dimensions including Memorization, Understanding, Application, Reasoning, Creativity, and Ethics. (2) Authenticity: Our benchmark integrates real exam questions, classroom conversation, student essays, and expert-designed prompts to reflect genuine educational challenges; (3) Scale: EduEval comprises 24 distinct task types with over 11,000 questions spanning primary to high school levels. We evaluate 14 leading LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings, revealing that while models perform well on factual tasks, they struggle with classroom dialogue classification and exhibit inconsistent results in creative content generation. Interestingly, several open source models outperform proprietary systems on complex educational reasoning. Few-shot prompting shows varying effectiveness across cognitive dimensions, suggesting that different educational objectives require tailored approaches. These findings provide targeted benchmarking metrics for developing LLMs specifically optimized for diverse Chinese educational tasks.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of 47 Context-Based Question Answer Models Across 8 Diverse Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context-based question answering (CBQA) models provide more accurate and relevant answers by considering the contextual information. They effectively extract specific information given a context, making them functional in various applications involving user support, information retrieval, and educational platforms. In this manuscript, we benchmarked the performance of 47 CBQA models from Hugging Face on eight different datasets. This study aims to identify the best-performing model across diverse datasets without additional fine-tuning. It is valuable for practical applications where the need to retrain models for specific datasets is minimized, streamlining the implementation of these models in various contexts. The best-performing models were trained on the SQuAD v2 or SQuAD v1 datasets. The best-performing model was ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512, which yielded 43\% accuracy across all datasets. We observed that the computation time of all models depends on the context length and the model size. The model's performance usually decreases with an increase in the answer length. Moreover, the model's performance depends on the context complexity. We also used the Genetic algorithm to improve the overall accuracy by integrating responses from other models. ahotrod/electra_large_discriminator_squad2_512 generated the best results for bioasq10b-factoid (65.92\%), biomedical\_cpgQA (96.45\%), QuAC (11.13\%), and Question Answer Dataset (41.6\%). Bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad achieved an accuracy of 82\% on the IELTS dataset.</description>

      <title>Evidence-Guided Schema Normalization for Temporal Tabular Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning over evolving semi-structured tables poses a challenge to current QA systems. We propose a SQL-based approach that involves (1) generating a 3NF schema from Wikipedia infoboxes, (2) generating SQL queries, and (3) query execution. Our central finding challenges model scaling assumptions: the quality of schema design has a greater impact on QA precision than model capacity. We establish three evidence-based principles: normalization that preserves context, semantic naming that reduces ambiguity, and consistent temporal anchoring. Our best configuration (Gemini 2.5 Flash schema + Gemini-2.0-Flash queries) achieves 80.39 EM, a 16.8\% improvement over the baseline (68.89 EM).</description>

      <title>Assertion-Conditioned Compliance: A Provenance-Aware Vulnerability in Multi-Turn Tool-Calling Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-turn tool-calling LLMs (models capable of invoking external APIs or tools across several user turns) have emerged as a key feature in modern AI assistants, enabling extended dialogues from benign tasks to critical business, medical, and financial operations. Yet implementing multi-turn pipelines remains difficult for many safety-critical industries due to ongoing concerns regarding model resilience. While standardized benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) have underpinned confidence concerning advanced function-calling models (like Salesforce's xLAM V2), there is still a lack of visibility into multi-turn conversation-level robustness, especially given their exposure to real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce Assertion-Conditioned Compliance (A-CC), a novel evaluation paradigm for multi-turn function-calling dialogues. A-CC provides holistic metrics that evaluate a model's behavior when confronted with misleading assertions originating from two distinct vectors: (1) user-sourced assertions (USAs), which measure sycophancy toward plausible but misinformed user beliefs, and (2) function-sourced assertions (FSAs), which measure compliance with plausible but contradictory system policies (e.g., stale hints from unmaintained tools). Our results show that models are highly vulnerable to both USA sycophancy and FSA policy conflicts, confirming A-CC as a critical, latent vulnerability in deployed agents.</description>

      <title>IndicParam: Benchmark to evaluate LLMs on low-resource Indic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models excel on high-resource multilingual tasks, low- and extremely low-resource Indic languages remain severely under-evaluated. We present IndicParam, a human-curated benchmark of over 13,000 multiple-choice questions covering 11 such languages (Nepali, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia as low-resource; Dogri, Maithili, Rajasthani, Sanskrit, Bodo, Santali, Konkani as extremely low-resource) plus Sanskrit-English code-mixed set. We evaluated 19 LLMs, both proprietary and open-weights, which reveals that even the top-performing GPT-5 reaches only 45.0% average accuracy, followed by DeepSeek-3.2 (43.1) and Claude-4.5 (42.7). We additionally label each question as knowledge-oriented or purely linguistic to discriminate factual recall from grammatical proficiency. Further, we assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside conventional multiple-choice questions. IndicParam provides insights into limitations of cross-lingual transfer and establishes a challenging benchmark for Indic languages. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/bharatgenai/IndicParam. Scripts to run benchmark are present at https://github.com/ayushbits/IndicParam.</description>

      <title>CourseTimeQA: A Lecture-Video Benchmark and a Latency-Constrained Cross-Modal Fusion Method for Timestamped QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study timestamped question answering over educational lecture videos under a single-GPU latency/memory budget. Given a natural-language query, the system retrieves relevant timestamped segments and synthesizes a grounded answer. We present CourseTimeQA (52.3 h, 902 queries across six courses) and a lightweight, latency-constrained cross-modal retriever (CrossFusion-RAG) that combines frozen encoders, a learned 512-&gt;768 vision projection, shallow query-agnostic cross-attention over ASR and frames with a temporal-consistency regularizer, and a small cross-attentive reranker. On CourseTimeQA, CrossFusion-RAG improves nDCG@10 by 0.10 and MRR by 0.08 over a strong BLIP-2 retriever while achieving approximately 1.55 s median end-to-end latency on a single A100. Closest comparators (zero-shot CLIP multi-frame pooling; CLIP + cross-encoder reranker + MMR; learned late-fusion gating; text-only hybrid with cross-encoder reranking and its MMR variant; caption-augmented text retrieval; non-learned temporal smoothing) are evaluated under matched hardware and indexing. We report robustness across ASR noise (WER quartiles), diagnostics for temporal localization, and full training/tuning details to support reproducible comparison.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has explored LLMs as scalable tools for relevance labeling, but studies indicate they are susceptible to priming effects, where prior relevance judgments influence later ones. Although psychological theories link personality traits to such biases, it is unclear whether simulated personalities in LLMs exhibit similar effects. We investigate how Big Five personality profiles in LLMs influence priming in relevance labeling, using multiple LLMs on TREC 2021 and 2022 Deep Learning Track datasets. Our results show that certain profiles, such as High Openness and Low Neuroticism, consistently reduce priming susceptibility. Additionally, the most effective personality in mitigating priming may vary across models and task types. Based on these findings, we propose personality prompting as a method to mitigate threshold priming, connecting psychological evidence with LLM-based evaluation practices.</description>

      <title>A Taxonomy of Errors in English as she is spoke: Toward an AI-Based Method of Error Analysis for EFL Writing Instruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study describes the development of an AI-assisted error analysis system designed to identify, categorize, and correct writing errors in English. Utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek R1, the system employs a detailed taxonomy grounded in linguistic theories from Corder (1967), Richards (1971), and James (1998). Errors are classified at both word and sentence levels, covering spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Implemented through Python-coded API calls, the system provides granular feedback beyond traditional rubric-based assessments. Initial testing on isolated errors refined the taxonomy, addressing challenges like overlapping categories. Final testing used "English as she is spoke" by Jose da Fonseca (1855), a text rich with authentic linguistic errors, to evaluate the system's capacity for handling complex, multi-layered analysis. The AI successfully identified diverse error types but showed limitations in contextual understanding and occasionally generated new error categories when encountering uncoded errors. This research demonstrates AI's potential to transform EFL instruction by automating detailed error analysis and feedback. While promising, further development is needed to improve contextual accuracy and expand the taxonomy to stylistic and discourse-level errors.</description>

      <title>CryptoBench: A Dynamic Benchmark for Expert-Level Evaluation of LLM Agents in Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the real-world capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the uniquely demanding and fast-paced cryptocurrency domain. Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.
  Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.</description>

      <title>SCALE: Selective Resource Allocation for Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks in Mathematical Test-time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computational resources during inference. However, current methods employ uniform resource distribution across all reasoning sub-problems, creating fundamental bottlenecks where challenging sub-problems receive insufficient attention while routine operations consume disproportionate resources. This uniform allocation creates performance bottlenecks where additional computational resources yield diminishing returns. Inspired by dual-process theory, we propose \textbf{SCALE} (Selective Resource Allocation), a framework that selectively allocates computational resources based on sub-problem difficulty. SCALE operates through four stages: (1) problem decomposition into sequential reasoning sub-problems, (2) difficulty assessment of each sub-problem to distinguish between routine operations and computationally challenging sub-problems, (3) selective processing mode assignment between System 1 for simple sub-problems and System 2 for complex ones, and (4) sequential execution with context propagation. By concentrating resources on challenging sub-problems while processing routine operations efficiently, SCALE achieves substantial performance improvements with superior resource utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCALE significantly outperforms uniform scaling baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 13.75 percentage points (57.50% to 71.25% on AIME25) while reducing computational costs by 33%-53%, representing a major advance in test-time scaling that addresses fundamental limitations of current approaches.</description>

      <title>CACARA: Cross-Modal Alignment Leveraging a Text-Centric Approach for Cost-Effective Multimodal and Multilingual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep learning models evolve, new applications and challenges are rapidly emerging. Tasks that once relied on a single modality, such as text, images, or audio, are now enriched by seamless interactions between multimodal data. These connections bridge information gaps: an image can visually materialize a text, while audio can add context to an image. Researchers have developed numerous multimodal models, but most rely on resource-intensive training across multiple modalities. Similarly, extending these models to new languages often follows the same resource-heavy training strategy. In this work, we propose a multimodal and multilingual architecture, CACARA, trained through emergent alignment learning, enabling the seamless integration of new modalities into an existing bimodal/multimodal model without requiring full retraining. This work breaks new ground by demonstrating that this emergent alignment paradigm can unlock multilingual capabilities from monolingual training. By fine-tuning the newly incorporated modality only on data aligned with the English language, our model develops support for over 100 languages without explicit multilingual pretraining or tuning of the text encoder. Such emergent multimodal and multilingual properties are gained efficiently, preserving previously learned knowledge at a training cost comparable to that of a monolingual model. Our strategy achieves up to a 14.24 percentage points improvement in R@1 audio-to-text retrieval, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal models -- all without the heavy computational cost of retraining across every modality and language.</description>

      <title>G-KV: Decoding-Time KV Cache Eviction with Global Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks but encounter significant computational and memory challenges due to long sequence lengths. KV cache compression has emerged as an effective approach to greatly enhance the efficiency of reasoning. However, existing methods often focus on prompt compression or token eviction with local attention score, overlooking the long-term importance of tokens. We propose G-KV, a KV cache eviction method that employs a global scoring mechanism, combining local and historical attention scores to more accurately assess token importance. Additionally, we introduce post-training techniques, including reinforcement learning and distillation, to optimize models for compressed KV cache settings. The code of this paper is available on: https://github.com/microsoft/G-KV.</description>

      <title>Developing a Comprehensive Framework for Sentiment Analysis in Turkish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we developed a comprehensive framework for sentiment analysis that takes its many aspects into account mainly for Turkish. We have also proposed several approaches specific to sentiment analysis in English only. We have accordingly made five major and three minor contributions. We generated a novel and effective feature set by combining unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised metrics. We then fed them as input into classical machine learning methods, and outperformed neural network models for datasets of different genres in both Turkish and English. We created a polarity lexicon with a semi-supervised domain-specific method, which has been the first approach applied for corpora in Turkish. We performed a fine morphological analysis for the sentiment classification task in Turkish by determining the polarities of morphemes. This can be adapted to other morphologically-rich or agglutinative languages as well. We have built a novel neural network architecture, which combines recurrent and recursive neural network models for English. We built novel word embeddings that exploit sentiment, syntactic, semantic, and lexical characteristics for both Turkish and English. We also redefined context windows as subclauses in modelling word representations in English. This can also be applied to other linguistic fields and natural language processing tasks. We have achieved state-of-the-art and significant results for all these original approaches. Our minor contributions include methods related to aspect-based sentiment in Turkish, parameter redefinition in the semi-supervised approach, and aspect term extraction techniques for English. This thesis can be considered the most detailed and comprehensive study made on sentiment analysis in Turkish as of July, 2020. Our work has also contributed to the opinion classification problem in English.</description>

      <title>Catch Me If You Can: How Smaller Reasoning Models Pretend to Reason with Mathematical Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current evaluation of mathematical reasoning in language models relies primarily on answer accuracy, potentially masking fundamental failures in logical computation. We introduce a diagnostic framework that distinguishes genuine mathematical reasoning from superficial pattern matching through four complementary axes: forward-backward consistency, transitivity coverage, counterfactual sensitivity, and perturbation robustness. Through a case study applying this framework to Qwen3-0.6B on the MenatQA dataset, we reveal a striking disconnect between surface performance and reasoning fidelity. While the model achieves reasonable answer accuracy (70%+), it demonstrates poor backward consistency (15%), limited transitivity coverage (32.2%), and brittle sensitivity to perturbations. Our diagnostics expose reasoning failures invisible to traditional accuracy metrics, suggesting that this small model relies heavily on pattern matching rather than genuine logical computation. While our empirical findings are based on a single 600M-parameter model, the diagnostic framework itself is model-agnostic and generalizable. We release our evaluation protocols to enable the research community to assess reasoning fidelity across different model scales and architectures, moving beyond surface-level accuracy toward verifiable mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Slovak Conceptual Dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving tasks in the field of natural language processing, we sometimes need dictionary tools, such as lexicons, word form dictionaries or knowledge bases. However, the availability of dictionary data is insufficient in many languages, especially in the case of low resourced languages. In this article, we introduce a new conceptual dictionary for the Slovak language as the first linguistic tool of this kind. Since Slovak language is a language with limited linguistic resources and there are currently not available any machine-readable linguistic data sources with a sufficiently large volume of data, many tasks which require automated processing of Slovak text achieve weaker results compared to other languages and are almost impossible to solve.</description>

      <title>Wikontic: Constructing Wikidata-Aligned, Ontology-Aware Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide structured, verifiable grounding for large language models (LLMs), but current LLM-based systems commonly use KGs as auxiliary structures for text retrieval, leaving their intrinsic quality underexplored. In this work, we propose Wikontic, a multi-stage pipeline that constructs KGs from open-domain text by extracting candidate triplets with qualifiers, enforcing Wikidata-based type and relation constraints, and normalizing entities to reduce duplication. The resulting KGs are compact, ontology-consistent, and well-connected; on MuSiQue, the correct answer entity appears in 96% of generated triplets. On HotpotQA, our triplets-only setup achieves 76.0 F1, and on MuSiQue 59.8 F1, matching or surpassing several retrieval-augmented generation baselines that still require textual context. In addition, Wikontic attains state-of-the-art information-retention performance on the MINE-1 benchmark (86%), outperforming prior KG construction methods. Wikontic is also efficient at build time: KG construction uses less than 1,000 output tokens, about 3$\times$ fewer than AriGraph and $&lt;$1/20 of GraphRAG. The proposed pipeline enhances the quality of the generated KG and offers a scalable solution for leveraging structured knowledge in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Prism: A Minimal Compositional Metalanguage for Specifying Agent Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prism is a small, compositional metalanguage for specifying the behaviour of tool-using software agents. Rather than introducing ad hoc control constructs, Prism is built around a fixed core context, Core1, which provides a minimal background grammar of categories numbers, strings, user prompts, tools together with abstract combinators for booleans, predicates, pairs, and lists. Agent policies are written as ordinary expressions using a single abstraction operator so that conditionals appear as selections between alternatives instead of imperative if-else blocks. Domains extend the core by defining their own context-mini-grammars that introduce new categories, predicates, and external tools while reusing the same compositional machinery. We illustrate this with worked examples from thermostat control, home security, e-commerce recommendation, and medical monitoring, showing how natural language decision rules can be mapped to inspectable, executable policies. From a linguistic perspective, Prism enforces a clear separation between a reusable grammar-like core and domain specific lexicons and treats tools as bridges between internal policy representations and the external world. From an engineering perspective, it offers a compact interface language for agent control, making the space of possible actions explicit and amenable to analysis, verification, and safety constraints.</description>

      <title>ART: Adaptive Response Tuning Framework -- A Multi-Agent Tournament-Based Approach to LLM Response Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, single-model responses often exhibit inconsistencies, hallucinations, and varying quality across different query domains. This paper presents ART (Adaptive Response Tuning), a novel framework that employs tournament-style ELO ranking and multi-agent reasoning to systematically optimize LLM outputs. By enabling multiple LLM agents to compete, critique, and collaborate through structured tournament workflows, ART produces consensus responses that outperform individual model outputs. Our framework introduces configurable tournament parameters, dynamic agent selection, and multiple consensus fusion strategies. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in response accuracy, coherence, and reliability compared to baseline single-model approaches. The ART framework provides a scalable, production-ready solution for applications requiring high-quality, vetted LLM responses, achieving an 8.4% improvement in overall quality metrics and R22 values exceeding 0.96 in ELO rating convergence.</description>

Abstract: Sycophantic response patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly claimed in the literature. We review methodological challenges in measuring LLM sycophancy and identify five core operationalizations. Despite sycophancy being inherently human-centric, current research does not evaluate human perception. Our analysis highlights the difficulties in distinguishing sycophantic responses from related concepts in AI alignment and offers actionable recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>Graphing the Truth: Structured Visualizations for Automated Hallucination Detection in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have rapidly advanced in their ability to interpret and generate natural language. In enterprise settings, they are frequently augmented with closed-source domain knowledge to deliver more contextually informed responses. However, operational constraints such as limited context windows and inconsistencies between pre-training data and supplied knowledge often lead to hallucinations, some of which appear highly credible and escape routine human review. Current mitigation strategies either depend on costly, large-scale gold-standard Q\&amp;A curation or rely on secondary model verification, neither of which offers deterministic assurance. This paper introduces a framework that organizes proprietary knowledge and model-generated content into interactive visual knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide end users with a clear, intuitive view of potential hallucination zones by linking model assertions to underlying sources of truth and indicating confidence levels. Through this visual interface, users can diagnose inconsistencies, identify weak reasoning chains, and supply corrective feedback. The resulting human-in-the-loop workflow creates a structured feedback loop that can enhance model reliability and continuously improve response quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence tools, like ChatGPT, are an increasingly utilized resource among computational social scientists. Nevertheless, there remains space for improved understanding of the performance of ChatGPT in complex tasks such as classifying and annotating datasets containing nuanced language. Method. In this paper, we measure the performance of GPT-4 on one such task and compare results to human annotators. We investigate ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4o to examine performance given rapid changes in technological advancement of large language models. We craft four prompt styles as input and evaluate precision, recall, and F1 scores. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of results demonstrate that while including label definitions in prompts may help performance, overall GPT-4 has difficulty classifying nuanced language. Qualitative analysis reveals four specific findings. Our results suggest the use of ChatGPT in classification tasks involving nuanced language should be conducted with prudence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a language-agnostic transformer-based POS tagging framework designed for low-resource languages, using Bangla and Hindi as case studies. With only three lines of framework-specific code, the model was adapted from Bangla to Hindi, demonstrating effective portability with minimal modification. The framework achieves 96.85 percent and 97 percent token-level accuracy across POS categories in Bangla and Hindi while sustaining strong F1 scores despite dataset imbalance and linguistic overlap. A performance discrepancy in a specific POS category underscores ongoing challenges in dataset curation. The strong results stem from the underlying transformer architecture, which can be replaced with limited code adjustments. Its modular and open-source design enables rapid cross-lingual adaptation while reducing model design and tuning overhead, allowing researchers to focus on linguistic preprocessing and dataset refinement, which are essential for advancing NLP in underrepresented languages.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-Hyperparameter-Free Sampling: Entropy Equilibrium for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Token sampling strategies critically influence text generation quality in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods introduce additional hyperparameters, requiring extensive tuning and complicating deployment. We present Entropy Equilibrium Sampling (EES), an auxiliary hyperparameter-free approach inspired by information theory that can dynamically adjust candidate sets by balancing normalized entropy with probability mass. We evaluate EES on both reasoning and generation tasks across a range of model architectures. Our results show that EES consistently performs well across temperature settings, delivering competitive accuracy and coherence while maintaining diversity. By eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning, EES greatly simplifies deployment while improving performance. Code is available at https://github.com/shuanncai/EES</description>

      <title>Accelerating Bangla NLP Tasks with Automatic Mixed Precision: Resource-Efficient Training Preserving Model Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) requires substantial computational resources and time, posing significant challenges, especially for NLP development in Bangla, where access to high-end hardware is often limited. In this work, we explore automatic mixed precision (AMP) training as a means to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing model performance. By leveraging a dynamic mix of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point computations, AMP lowers GPU memory requirements and speeds up training without degrading model performance. We evaluate AMP across four standard Bangla NLP tasks, namely sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, error classification, and question answering, using four transformer-based models: BanglaBERT, BanglishBERT, XLM-R, and mBERT. Our results demonstrate that AMP accelerates training by 44.5% and reduces memory consumption by 17.6%, while maintaining F-1 score within 99.7% of the full-precision baselines. This empirical study highlights AMP's potential to democratize access to state-of-the-art NLP capabilities in hardware-constrained settings by lowering computational barriers.</description>

      <title>WaterSearch: A Quality-Aware Search-based Watermarking Framework for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking acts as a critical safeguard in text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). By embedding identifiable signals into model outputs, watermarking enables reliable attribution and enhances the security of machine-generated content. Existing approaches typically embed signals by manipulating token generation probabilities. Despite their effectiveness, these methods inherently face a trade-off between detectability and text quality: the signal strength and randomness required for robust watermarking tend to degrade the performance of downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we design a novel embedding scheme that controls seed pools to facilitate diverse parallel generation of watermarked text. Based on that scheme, we propose WaterSearch, a sentence-level, search-based watermarking framework adaptable to a wide range of existing methods. WaterSearch enhances text quality by jointly optimizing two key aspects: 1) distribution fidelity and 2) watermark signal characteristics. Furthermore, WaterSearch is complemented by a sentence-level detection method with strong attack robustness. We evaluate our method on three popular LLMs across ten diverse tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an average performance improvement of 51.01\% over state-of-the-art baselines at a watermark detectability strength of 95\%. In challenging scenarios such as short text generation and low-entropy output generation, our method yields performance gains of 47.78\% and 36.47\%, respectively. Moreover, under different attack senarios including insertion, synonym substitution and paraphrase attasks, WaterSearch maintains high detectability, further validating its robust anti-attack capabilities.

      <title>Less is More: Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), but it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in complex datasets. While re- cent works decouple LoRA update matrices to exploit matrix-wise asymmetry, training costs remain high. We revisit LoRA from the perspective of inter-matrix and intra-layer parameter redundancy and propose Resource-Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, EffiLoRA, a lightweight and generalizable approach for language, multimodal, and diffusion models. EffiLoRA employs a unified A matrix across all transformer layers and introduces a runtime selective B matrices up- date to dynamically trade-off the system resource budget and model performance. EffiLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA across diverse modalities, including commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image generation, demon- strating improved efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Reward Auditor: Inference on Reward Modeling Suitability in Real-World Perturbed Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable reward models (RMs) are critical for ensuring the safe alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, current evaluation methods focus solely on preference perception accuracies in given specific scenarios, obscuring the critical vulnerabilities of RMs in real-world scenarios. We identify the true challenge lies in assessing a novel dimension: Suitability, defined as conditional reliability under specific real-world perturbations. To this end, we introduce Reward Auditor, a hypothesis-testing framework specifically designed for RM suitability inference. Rather than answering "How accurate is the RM's preference perception for given samples?", it employs scientific auditing to answer: "Can we infer RMs exhibit systematic vulnerabilities in specific real-world scenarios?". Under real-world perturbed scenarios, Reward Auditor quantifies statistical significance and effect size by auditing distribution degradation of RM preference perception confidence. This enables inference of both the certainty and severity of RM vulnerabilities across diverse real-world scenarios. This lays a solid foundation for building next-generation LLM alignment systems that are verifiably safe, more robust, and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Zero-Shot Scientific Summarisation: A Pilot Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce context inconsistency hallucinations, which are LLM generated outputs that are misaligned with the user prompt. This research project investigates whether prompt engineering (PE) methods can mitigate context inconsistency hallucinations in zero-shot LLM summarisation of scientific texts, where zero-shot indicates that the LLM relies purely on its pre-training data. Across eight yeast biotechnology research paper abstracts, six instruction-tuned LLMs were prompted with seven methods: a base- line prompt, two levels of increasing instruction complexity (PE-1 and PE-2), two levels of context repetition (CR-K1 and CR-K2), and two levels of random addition (RA-K1 and RA-K2). Context repetition involved the identification and repetition of K key sentences from the abstract, whereas random addition involved the repetition of K randomly selected sentences from the abstract, where K is 1 or 2. A total of 336 LLM-generated summaries were evaluated using six metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BERTScore, METEOR, and cosine similarity, which were used to compute the lexical and semantic alignment be- tween the summaries and the abstracts. Four hypotheses on the effects of prompt methods on summary alignment with the reference text were tested. Statistical analysis on 3744 collected datapoints was performed using bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence intervals and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction. The results demonstrated that CR and RA significantly improve the lexical alignment of LLM-generated summaries with the abstracts. These findings indicate that prompt engineering has the potential to impact hallucinations in zero-shot scientific summarisation tasks.</description>

      <title>DeformAr: Rethinking NER Evaluation through Component Analysis and Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance in English. However, their effectiveness in Arabic, particularly for Named Entity Recognition (NER), remains limited, even with larger pre-trained models. This performance gap stems from multiple factors, including tokenisation, dataset quality, and annotation inconsistencies. Existing studies often analyze these issues in isolation, failing to capture their joint effect on system behaviour and performance.
  We introduce DeformAr (Debugging and Evaluation Framework for Transformer-based NER Systems), a novel framework designed to investigate and explain the performance discrepancy between Arabic and English NER systems. DeformAr integrates a data extraction library and an interactive dashboard, supporting two modes of evaluation: cross-component analysis and behavioural analysis. The framework divides each language into dataset and model components to examine their interactions.
  The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, cross-component analysis provides systematic diagnostic measures across data and model subcomponents, addressing the "what," "how," and "why" behind observed discrepancies. The second stage applies behavioural analysis by combining interpretability techniques with token-level metrics, interactive visualisations, and representation space analysis. These stages enable a component-aware diagnostic process that detects model behaviours and explains them by linking them to underlying representational patterns and data factors. DeformAr is the first Arabic-specific, component-based interpretability tool, offering a crucial resource for advancing model analysis in under-resourced languages.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning of lightweight large language models for sentiment classification on heterogeneous financial textual data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) play an increasingly important role in finan- cial markets analysis by capturing signals from complex and heterogeneous textual data sources, such as tweets, news articles, reports, and microblogs. However, their performance is dependent on large computational resources and proprietary datasets, which are costly, restricted, and therefore inacces- sible to many researchers and practitioners. To reflect realistic situations we investigate the ability of lightweight open-source LLMs - smaller and publicly available models designed to operate with limited computational resources - to generalize sentiment understanding from financial datasets of varying sizes, sources, formats, and languages. We compare the benchmark finance natural language processing (NLP) model, FinBERT, and three open-source lightweight LLMs, DeepSeek-LLM 7B, Llama3 8B Instruct, and Qwen3 8B on five publicly available datasets: FinancialPhraseBank, Financial Question Answering, Gold News Sentiment, Twitter Sentiment and Chinese Finance Sentiment. We find that LLMs, specially Qwen3 8B and Llama3 8B, perform best in most scenarios, even from using only 5% of the available training data. These results hold in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our findings indicate that lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) consti- tute a cost-effective option, as they can achieve competitive performance on heterogeneous textual data even when trained on only a limited subset of the extensive annotated corpora that are typically deemed necessary.</description>

      <title>Table as a Modality for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To migrate the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the community has made numerous efforts to generalize them to the table reasoning tasks for the widely deployed tabular data. Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM. Empirical results on various benchmarking datasets, including HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA, have demonstrated significant improvements on generalization with an average relative gain of 42.65%.</description>

      <title>Dr.Mi-Bench: A Modular-integrated Benchmark for Scientific Deep Research Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth in academic literature necessitates automated deep research (DR) agents, yet their evaluation remains a significant challenge. First, existing benchmarks often focus narrowly on retrieval while neglecting high-level planning and reasoning. Second, existing benchmarks favor general domains over the scientific domains that are the core application for DR agents. To address these gaps, we introduce Dr.Mi-Bench, a Modular-integrated benchmark for scientific DR agents. Grounded in academic literature, our benchmark uses a human-annotated dataset of 200 instances across 10 scientific domains, including both research and review papers. Besides, we also propose a Modular-integrated Evaluation Paradigm for DR Agents (Dr.Mi-Eval), a novel modular-integrated evaluation paradigm, which leverages the rich structure of academic papers to assess the core competencies of planning, retrieval, and reasoning through two complementary modes: an end-to-end evaluation for DR agents and an isolated evaluation for foundational LLMs as potential backbones. Experimental results reveal a fragmented performance landscape: agents exhibit specialized strengths but share critical weaknesses, most notably in performing the multi-source retrieval required for review-style tasks and performing consistently across diverse scientific fields. Moreover, improving high-level planning capability is the crucial factor for unlocking the reasoning potential of foundational LLMs as backbones. By exposing these actionable failure modes, Dr.Mi-Bench provides a diagnostic tool to guide the development of more reliable academic research assistants.</description>

      <title>Advancing Academic Chatbots: Evaluation of Non Traditional Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most evaluations of large language models focus on standard tasks such as factual question answering or short summarization. This research expands that scope in two directions: first, by comparing two retrieval strategies, Graph RAG, structured knowledge-graph based, and Advanced RAG, hybrid keyword-semantic search, for QA; and second, by evaluating whether LLMs can generate high quality non-traditional academic outputs, specifically slide decks and podcast scripts. We implemented a prototype combining Meta's LLaMA 3 70B open weight and OpenAI's GPT 4o mini API based. QA performance was evaluated using both human ratings across eleven quality dimensions and large language model judges for scalable cross validation. GPT 4o mini with Advanced RAG produced the most accurate responses. Graph RAG offered limited improvements and led to more hallucinations, partly due to its structural complexity and manual setup. Slide and podcast generation was tested with document grounded retrieval. GPT 4o mini again performed best, though LLaMA 3 showed promise in narrative coherence. Human reviewers were crucial for detecting layout and stylistic flaws, highlighting the need for combined human LLM evaluation in assessing emerging academic outputs.</description>

      <title>When Safety Blocks Sense: Measuring Semantic Confusion in LLM Refusals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety-aligned language models often refuse prompts that are actually harmless. Current evaluations mostly report global rates such as false rejection or compliance. These scores treat each prompt alone and miss local inconsistency, where a model accepts one phrasing of an intent but rejects a close paraphrase. This gap limits diagnosis and tuning. We introduce "semantic confusion," a failure mode that captures such local inconsistency, and a framework to measure it. We build ParaGuard, a 10k-prompt corpus of controlled paraphrase clusters that hold intent fixed while varying surface form. We then propose three model-agnostic metrics at the token level: Confusion Index, Confusion Rate, and Confusion Depth. These metrics compare each refusal to its nearest accepted neighbors and use token embeddings, next-token probabilities, and perplexity signals. Experiments across diverse model families and deployment guards show that global false-rejection rate hides critical structure. Our metrics reveal globally unstable boundaries in some settings, localized pockets of inconsistency in others, and cases where stricter refusal does not increase inconsistency. We also show how confusion-aware auditing separates how often a system refuses from how sensibly it refuses. This gives developers a practical signal to reduce false refusals while preserving safety.</description>

      <title>ELR-1000: A Community-Generated Dataset for Endangered Indic Indigenous Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a culturally-grounded multimodal dataset of 1,060 traditional recipes crowdsourced from rural communities across remote regions of Eastern India, spanning 10 endangered languages. These recipes, rich in linguistic and cultural nuance, were collected using a mobile interface designed for contributors with low digital literacy. Endangered Language Recipes (ELR)-1000 -- captures not only culinary practices but also the socio-cultural context embedded in indigenous food traditions. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on translating these recipes into English and find the following: despite the models' capabilities, they struggle with low-resource, culturally-specific language. However, we observe that providing targeted context -- including background information about the languages, translation examples, and guidelines for cultural preservation -- leads to significant improvements in translation quality. Our results underscore the need for benchmarks that cater to underrepresented languages and domains to advance equitable and culturally-aware language technologies. As part of this work, we release the ELR-1000 dataset to the NLP community, hoping it motivates the development of language technologies for endangered languages.</description>

      <title>How do we measure privacy in text? A survey of text anonymization metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to clarify and reconcile metrics for evaluating privacy protection in text through a systematic survey. Although text anonymization is essential for enabling NLP research and model development in domains with sensitive data, evaluating whether anonymization methods sufficiently protect privacy remains an open challenge. In manually reviewing 47 papers that report privacy metrics, we identify and compare six distinct privacy notions, and analyze how the associated metrics capture different aspects of privacy risk. We then assess how well these notions align with legal privacy standards (HIPAA and GDPR), as well as user-centered expectations grounded in HCI studies. Our analysis offers practical guidance on navigating the landscape of privacy evaluation approaches further and highlights gaps in current practices. Ultimately, we aim to facilitate more robust, comparable, and legally aware privacy evaluations in text anonymization.</description>

      <title>DrawingBench: Evaluating Spatial Reasoning and UI Interaction Capabilities of Large Language Models through Mouse-Based Drawing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As agentic AI systems increasingly operate autonomously, establishing trust through verifiable evaluation becomes critical. Yet existing benchmarks lack the transparency and auditability needed to assess whether agents behave reliably. We present DrawingBench, a verification framework for evaluating the trustworthiness of agentic LLMs through spatial reasoning tasks that require generating sequences of low-level GUI actions. Unlike opaque evaluations, DrawingBench provides transparent, rule-based assessment: 8 objective criteria enable reproducible scoring, while action-level inspection allows stakeholders to audit agent behavior. Our framework comprises 250 diverse prompts across 20 categories and 4 difficulty levels, deterministic evaluation metrics, and an external oversight mechanism through multi-turn feedback that enables human control over agent refinement. Evaluating four state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude-4 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, Gemini-2.5 Flash) across 1,000 tests, we establish both capabilities and limitations: models achieved 92.8% perfect performance with structured external feedback driving significant improvements (average +3.2%, up to +32.8% for complex scenes), but systematic error patterns emerged in tool state management and long-horizon planning. Notably, specification clarity proved more important than task complexity -- models achieved 100% perfect performance when given explicit, verifiable criteria. These findings demonstrate that transparent evaluation frameworks can establish trust in agentic systems, with external oversight proving more reliable than self-correction for guiding agent behavior. Our open-source framework provides a template for trustworthy agent assessment. Code and data: https://github.com/hyunjun1121/DrawingBench</description>

      <title>TempPerturb-Eval: On the Joint Effects of Internal Temperature and External Perturbations in RAG Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically examines retrieval quality and generation parameters like temperature in isolation, overlooking their interaction. This work presents a systematic investigation of how text perturbations (simulating noisy retrieval) interact with temperature settings across multiple LLM runs. We propose a comprehensive RAG Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework that subjects retrieved documents to three distinct perturbation types across varying temperature settings. Through extensive experiments on HotpotQA with both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we demonstrate that performance degradation follows distinct patterns: high-temperature settings consistently amplify vulnerability to perturbations, while certain perturbation types exhibit non-linear sensitivity across the temperature range. Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalist Large Language Models Outperform Clinical Tools on Medical Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specialized clinical AI assistants are rapidly entering medical practice, often framed as safer or more reliable than general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Yet, unlike frontier models, these clinical tools are rarely subjected to independent, quantitative evaluation, creating a critical evidence gap despite their growing influence on diagnosis, triage, and guideline interpretation. We assessed two widely deployed clinical AI systems (OpenEvidence and UpToDate Expert AI) against three state-of-the-art generalist LLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) using a 1,000-item mini-benchmark combining MedQA (medical knowledge) and HealthBench (clinician-alignment) tasks. Generalist models consistently outperformed clinical tools, with GPT-5 achieving the highest scores, while OpenEvidence and UpToDate demonstrated deficits in completeness, communication quality, context awareness, and systems-based safety reasoning. These findings reveal that tools marketed for clinical decision support may often lag behind frontier LLMs, underscoring the urgent need for transparent, independent evaluation before deployment in patient-facing workflows.</description>

      <title>Conveying Imagistic Thinking in Traditional Chinese Medicine Translation: A Prompt Engineering and LLM-Based Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient, and replicable HITL methodological pathway for the translation of ancient, concept-dense texts such as TCM.</description>

      <title>Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Classification using Machine Learning Techniques for Nagamese Language - A Low-resource Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nagamese language, a.k.a Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the people from Nagaland and people from Assam in the north-east India. Substantial amount of work in sentiment analysis has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on sentiment analysis and emotion classification for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to detect sentiments in terms of polarity (positive, negative and neutral) and basic emotions contained in textual content of Nagamese language. We build sentiment polarity lexicon of 1,195 nagamese words and use these to build features along with additional features for supervised machine learning techniques using Na"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

      <title>SUPERChem: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark in Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating the chemical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by oversimplified tasks, lack of process-level evaluation, and misalignment with expert-level chemistry skills. To address these issues, we introduce SUPERChem, a benchmark of 500 expert-curated reasoning-intensive chemistry problems, covering diverse subfields and provided in both multimodal and text-only formats. Original content and an iterative curation pipeline eliminate flawed items and mitigate data contamination. Each problem is paired with an expert-authored solution path, enabling Reasoning Path Fidelity (RPF) scoring to evaluate reasoning quality beyond final-answer accuracy. Evaluations against a human baseline of 40.3% accuracy show that even the best-performing model, GPT-5 (High), reaches only 38.5%, followed closely by Gemini 2.5 Pro (37.9%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think (37.3%). SUPERChem elicits multi-step, multimodal reasoning, reveals model-dependent effects of visual information, and distinguishes high-fidelity reasoners from heuristic ones. By providing a challenging benchmark and a reliable evaluation framework, SUPERChem aims to facilitate the advancement of LLMs toward expert-level chemical intelligence. The dataset of the benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZehuaZhao/SUPERChem.</description>

      <title>Kardia-R1: Unleashing LLMs to Reason toward Understanding and Empathy for Emotional Support via Rubric-as-Judge Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As web platforms evolve towards greater personalization and emotional complexity, conversational agents must transcend superficial empathy to demonstrate identity-aware emotional reasoning. However, existing systems face two limitations: (1) reliance on situation-centric datasets lacking persistent user identity, which hampers the capture of personalized affective nuances; and (2) dependence on opaque, coarse reward signals that hinder development of verifiable empathetic reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce KardiaBench, a large-scale user-grounded benchmark comprising 178,080 QA pairs across 22,080 multi-turn conversations anchored to 671 real-world profiles. The dataset is constructed via a model-in-the-loop pipeline with iterative rubric-guided refinement to ensure psychological plausibility and persona consistency. This progressive empathy pipeline that integrates user comprehension, contextual reasoning, and emotion perception into conversations, followed by iterative critique and rubric-based refinement to ensure psychological plausibility, emotional fidelity, and persona consistency. Building on this, we propose Kardia-R1, a framework that trains models for interpretable, stepwise empathetic cognition. Kardia-R1 leverages Rubric-as-Judge Empathetic Reinforcement Learning (Rubric-ERL), a GRPO-based method that uses explainable, human-aligned rubric rewards to tightly couple user understanding, emotional inference, and supportive response generation. Extensive experiments across four LLM backbones demonstrate that Kardia-R1 consistently outperforms othet methods in emotion accuracy, empathy, relevance, persona consistency, and safety. Our dataset and model will be released at https://github.com/JhCircle/Kardia-R1.</description>

      <title>Agreement-Constrained Probabilistic Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding generates high-quality translations by maximizing the expected utility of output candidates, but it evaluates all pairwise scores over the candidate set; hence, it takes quadratic time with respect to the number of candidates. To reduce the number of utility function calls, probabilistic MBR (PMBR) decoding partially evaluates quality scores using sampled pairs of candidates and completes the missing scores with a matrix completion algorithm. Nevertheless, it degrades the translation quality as the number of utility function calls is reduced. Therefore, to improve the trade-off between quality and cost, we propose agreement-constrained PMBR (AC-PMBR) decoding, which leverages a knowledge distilled model to guide the completion of the score matrix. Our AC-PMBR decoding improved approximation errors of matrix completion by up to 3 times and achieved higher translation quality compared with PMBR decoding at a comparable computational cost on the WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$De translation tasks.</description>

      <title>DyFuLM: An Advanced Multimodal Framework for Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding sentiment in complex textual expressions remains a fundamental challenge in affective computing. To address this, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Learning Model (DyFuLM), a multimodal framework designed to capture both hierarchical semantic representations and fine-grained emotional nuances. DyFuLM introduces two key moodules: a Hierarchical Dynamic Fusion module that adaptively integrates multi-level features, and a Gated Feature Aggregation module that regulates cross-layer information ffow to achieve balanced representation learning. Comprehensive experiments on multi-task sentiment datasets demonstrate that DyFuLM achieves 82.64% coarse-grained and 68.48% fine-grained accuracy, yielding the lowest regression errors (MAE = 0.0674, MSE = 0.0082) and the highest R^2 coefficient of determination (R^2= 0.6903). Furthermore, the ablation study validates the effectiveness of each module in DyFuLM. When all modules are removed, the accuracy drops by 0.91% for coarse-grained and 0.68% for fine-grained tasks. Keeping only the gated fusion module causes decreases of 0.75% and 0.55%, while removing the dynamic loss mechanism results in drops of 0.78% and 0.26% for coarse-grained and fine-grained sentiment classification, respectively. These results demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to feature interaction and task balance. Overall, the experimental findings further validate that DyFuLM enhances sentiment representation and overall performance through effective hierarchical feature fusion.</description>

      <title>PromptBridge: Cross-Model Prompt Transfer for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) underpin applications in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and agent-based workflows. In practice, systems access LLMs via commercial APIs or open-source deployments, and the model landscape (e.g., GPT, Claude, Llama) evolves rapidly. This rapid evolution forces frequent model switches driven by capability, cost, deployment constraints, and privacy. Yet prompts are highly model-sensitive: reusing a prompt engineered for one model on another often yields substantially worse performance than a prompt optimized for the target model. We term this phenomenon Model Drifting. Through extensive empirical analysis across diverse LLM configurations, we show that model drifting is both common and severe. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptBridge, a training-free framework that preserves prompt effectiveness under model switches, enabling cross-model prompt transfer without costly per-task or per-model re-optimization. PromptBridge requires only a small set of alignment tasks for calibration. It first applies Model-Adaptive Reflective Prompt Evolution (MAP-RPE) to obtain task- and model-specific optimal prompts via iterative reflective refinement and quantitative evaluation. Using the resulting calibrated prompt pairs for the source and target models, PromptBridge learns a cross-model prompt mapping. At test time, i.e., for an unseen task, given a source-model prompt, this mapping directly produces an optimized prompt for the target model. Experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings show that PromptBridge consistently improves downstream accuracy while reducing migration effort. The code will be available soon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India's linguistic diversity presents both opportunities and challenges for fintech platforms. While the country has 31 major languages and over 100 minor ones, only 10\% of the population understands English, creating barriers to financial inclusion. We present a multilingual conversational AI system for a financial assistance use case that supports code-mixed languages like Hinglish, enabling natural interactions for India's diverse user base. Our system employs a multi-agent architecture with language classification, function management, and multilingual response generation. Through comparative analysis of multiple language models and real-world deployment, we demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement while maintaining low latency overhead (4-8\%). This work contributes to bridging the language gap in digital financial services for emerging markets.</description>

      <title>MEGConformer: Conformer-Based MEG Decoder for Robust Speech and Phoneme Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Conformer-based decoders for the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL competition, targeting two foundational MEG tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, surpassing the competition baselines and ranking within the top-10 in both tasks. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing BERT Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis in Lower-Resourced Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited data for low-resource languages typically yield weaker language models (LMs). Since pre-training is compute-intensive, it is more pragmatic to target improvements during fine-tuning. In this work, we examine the use of Active Learning (AL) methods augmented by structured data selection strategies which we term 'Active Learning schedulers', to boost the fine-tuning process with a limited amount of training data. We connect the AL to data clustering and propose an integrated fine-tuning pipeline that systematically combines AL, clustering, and dynamic data selection schedulers to enhance model's performance. Experiments in the Slovak, Maltese, Icelandic and Turkish languages show that the use of clustering during the fine-tuning phase together with AL scheduling can simultaneously produce annotation savings up to 30% and performance improvements up to four F1 score points, while also providing better fine-tuning stability.</description>

      <title>MCAT: Scaling Many-to-Many Speech-to-Text Translation with MLLMs to 70 Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved great success in Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) tasks. However, current research is constrained by two key challenges: language coverage and efficiency. Most of the popular S2TT datasets are substantially English-centric, which restricts the scaling-up of MLLMs' many-to-many translation capabilities. Moreover, the inference speed of MLLMs degrades dramatically when the speech is converted into long sequences (e.g., 750 tokens). To address these limitations, we propose a Multilingual Cost-effective Accelerated Speech-to-Text Translator (MCAT) framework, which includes two innovations. First, a language scaling method that leverages curriculum learning and a data balancing strategy is introduced to extend the language coverage supported by MLLMs to 70 languages and achieve mutual translation among these languages. Second, an optimized speech adapter module is designed to reduce the length of the speech sequence to only 30 tokens. Extensive experiments were conducted on MLLMs of different scales (9B and 27B). The experimental results demonstrate that MCAT not only surpasses state-of-the-art end-to-end models on the FLEURS dataset across 70x69 directions but also enhances batch inference efficiency. This is achieved with only ~100M trainable parameters and by using only 10 hours of S2TT data per language. Furthermore, we have released MCAT as open-source to promote the development of MLLMs for robust S2TT capabilities. The code and models are released at https://github.com/yxduir/m2m-70.</description>

      <title>Language Diversity: Evaluating Language Usage and AI Performance on African Languages in Digital Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the digital representation of African languages and the challenges this presents for current language detection tools. We evaluate their performance on Yoruba, Kinyarwanda, and Amharic. While these languages are spoken by millions, their online usage on conversational platforms is often sparse, heavily influenced by English, and not representative of the authentic, monolingual conversations prevalent among native speakers. This lack of readily available authentic data online creates a challenge of scarcity of conversational data for training language models. To investigate this, data was collected from subreddits and local news sources for each language. The analysis showed a stark contrast between the two sources. Reddit data was minimal and characterized by heavy code-switching. Conversely, local news media offered a robust source of clean, monolingual language data, which also prompted more user engagement in the local language on the news publishers social media pages. Language detection models, including the specialized AfroLID and a general LLM, performed with near-perfect accuracy on the clean news data but struggled with the code-switched Reddit posts. The study concludes that professionally curated news content is a more reliable and effective source for training context-rich AI models for African languages than data from conversational platforms. It also highlights the need for future models that can process clean and code-switched text to improve the detection accuracy for African languages.</description>

      <title>MAC-SLU: Multi-Intent Automotive Cabin Spoken Language Understanding Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), which aims to extract user semantics to execute downstream tasks, is a crucial component of task-oriented dialog systems. Existing SLU datasets generally lack sufficient diversity and complexity, and there is an absence of a unified benchmark for the latest Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). This work introduces MAC-SLU, a novel Multi-Intent Automotive Cabin Spoken Language Understanding Dataset, which increases the difficulty of the SLU task by incorporating authentic and complex multi-intent data. Based on MAC-SLU, we conducted a comprehensive benchmark of leading open-source LLMs and LALMs, covering methods like in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and end-to-end (E2E) and pipeline paradigms. Our experiments show that while LLMs and LALMs have the potential to complete SLU tasks through in-context learning, their performance still lags significantly behind SFT. Meanwhile, E2E LALMs demonstrate performance comparable to pipeline approaches and effectively avoid error propagation from speech recognition. Code\footnote{https://github.com/Gatsby-web/MAC\_SLU} and datasets\footnote{huggingface.co/datasets/Gatsby1984/MAC\_SLU} are released publicly.</description>

      <title>Learning the Boundary of Solvability: Aligning LLMs to Detect Unsolvable Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring LLM reliability requires not only solving complex problems but also recognizing when a problem is unsolvable. Current models often struggle to distinguish objective unsolvability (inherent contradictions in the problem) from subjective capability limitations (problems beyond the model's competence), which leads to hallucinations and overconfidence. To address this, we propose UnsolvableQA and UnsolvableRL to solve feasible problems, detect inherent contradictions, and prudently refuse tasks beyond capability. Specifically, we construct UnsolvableQA, a dataset of paired solvable and unsolvable instances derived via a dual-track methodology: programmatic generation for logic puzzles and a novel "Reverse Construction" method that injects contradictions into valid reasoning chains for mathematics. Building on this dataset, we introduce UnsolvableRL, a reinforcement learning framework with three reward components jointly accounting for accuracy, unsolvability, and difficulty. Empirical results show that our approach achieves near-perfect unsolvability detection while also improving accuracy on solvable tasks. Crucially, we identify Capability Collapse, demonstrating that explicit exposure to unsolvable data is indispensable for preventing models from becoming systematically overconfident. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/sfasfaffa/unsolvableQA.</description>

      <title>MMAG: Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text within a single prompt but fall short in sustaining relevance, personalization, and continuity across extended interactions. Human communication, however, relies on multiple forms of memory, from recalling past conversations to adapting to personal traits and situational context. This paper introduces the Mixed Memory-Augmented Generation (MMAG) pattern, a framework that organizes memory for LLM-based agents into five interacting layers: conversational, long-term user, episodic and event-linked, sensory and context-aware, and short-term working memory. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we map these layers to technical components and outline strategies for coordination, prioritization, and conflict resolution. We demonstrate the approach through its implementation in the Heero conversational agent, where encrypted long-term bios and conversational history already improve engagement and retention. We further discuss implementation concerns around storage, retrieval, privacy, and latency, and highlight open challenges. MMAG provides a foundation for building memory-rich language agents that are more coherent, proactive, and aligned with human needs.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Borrowing Detection on Multilingual Wordlists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully self-supervised approach to borrowing detection in multilingual wordlists. The method combines two sources of information: PMI similarities based on a global correspondence model and a lightweight contrastive component trained on phonetic feature vectors. It further includes an automatic procedure for selecting decision thresholds without requiring labeled data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PMI alone already improves over existing string similarity measures such as NED and SCA, and that the combined similarity performs on par with or better than supervised baselines. An ablation study highlights the importance of character encoding, temperature settings and augmentation strategies. The approach scales to datasets of different sizes, works without manual supervision and is provided with a command-line tool that allows researchers to conduct their own studies.</description>

      <title>Beware of Reasoning Overconfidence: Pitfalls in the Reasoning Process for Multi-solution Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning tasks requiring a single correct answer, but they perform poorly in multi-solution tasks that require generating comprehensive and diverse answers. We attribute this limitation to \textbf{reasoning overconfidence}: a tendency to express undue certainty in an incomplete solution set. To examine the effect, we introduce \textit{MuSoBench}, a benchmark of multi-solution problems. Experiments show that the conventional short chain-of-thought (Short-CoT) prompting paradigm exhibits pronounced overconfidence, whereas the emerging long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) approach mitigates it through iterative exploration and self-reflection. We further characterise observable behaviours and influential factors. To probe the underlying cause, we propose the \textbf{cognitive-rigidity hypothesis}, which posits that overconfidence arises when the reasoning process prematurely converges on a narrow set of thought paths. An attention-entropy analysis offers preliminary support for this view. These findings provide tools for assessing the completeness of LLM reasoning and highlight the need to move evaluation beyond single-answer accuracy toward comprehensive exploration.</description>

      <title>Reasoning About the Unsaid: Misinformation Detection with Omission-Aware Graph Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the detection of misinformation, which deceives readers by explicitly fabricating misleading content or implicitly omitting important information necessary for informed judgment. While the former has been extensively studied, omission-based deception remains largely overlooked, even though it can subtly guide readers toward false conclusions under the illusion of completeness. To pioneer in this direction, this paper presents OmiGraph, the first omission-aware framework for misinformation detection. Specifically, OmiGraph constructs an omission-aware graph for the target news by utilizing a contextual environment that captures complementary perspectives of the same event, thereby surfacing potentially omitted contents. Based on this graph, omission-oriented relation modeling is then proposed to identify the internal contextual dependencies, as well as the dynamic omission intents, formulating a comprehensive omission relation representation. Finally, to extract omission patterns for detection, OmiGraph introduces omission-aware message-passing and aggregation that establishes holistic deception perception by integrating the omission contents and relations. Experiments show that, by considering the omission perspective, our approach attains remarkable performance, achieving average improvements of +5.4% F1 and +5.3% ACC on two large-scale benchmarks.</description>

      <title>InnoGym: Benchmarking the Innovation Potential of AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs and Agents have achieved impressive progress in code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific discovery. However, existing benchmarks primarily measure correctness, overlooking the diversity of methods behind solutions. True innovation depends not only on producing correct answers but also on the originality of the approach. We present InnoGym, the first benchmark and framework designed to systematically evaluate the innovation potential of AI agents. InnoGym introduces two complementary metrics: performance gain, which measures improvement over the best-known solutions, and novelty, which captures methodological differences from prior approaches. The benchmark includes 18 carefully curated tasks from real-world engineering and scientific domains, each standardized through resource filtering, evaluator validation, and solution collection. In addition, we provide iGym, a unified execution environment for reproducible and long-horizon evaluations. Extensive experiments show that while some agents produce novel approaches, their lack of robustness limits performance gains. These results highlight a key gap between creativity and effectiveness, underscoring the need for benchmarks that evaluate both.</description>

      <title>Beyond SFT: Reinforcement Learning for Safer Large Reasoning Models with Better Reasoning Ability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) extend large language models by generating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, significantly improving mathematical and logical problem solving. However, this explicit reasoning process also introduces new safety risks, as unsafe behaviors often emerge within intermediate reasoning trajectories, even when final answers appear harmless. Existing safety alignment approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over safety-oriented long CoT datasets. While intuitive, we find that SFT produces inconsistent safety improvements, degrades reasoning ability, and generalizes poorly across model families. These limitations suggest that purely supervised approaches are insufficient for robust safety alignment in LRMs. To address this, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a complementary optimization framework for LRM safety training. Unlike SFT, RL directly optimizes model policies with reward feedback, enabling more adaptive and stable alignment. Extensive experiments across multiple model families and benchmarks show that RL achieves stronger and more consistent safety gains while maintaining reasoning competence. Further analysis of reflection dynamics and token-level entropy reveals that RL suppresses unsafe exploratory reasoning while preserving reflective depth, leading to safer and more reliable reasoning processes.</description>

      <title>BHRAM-IL: A Benchmark for Hallucination Recognition and Assessment in Multiple Indian Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual applications but often generate plausible yet incorrect or misleading outputs, known as hallucinations. While hallucination detection has been studied extensively in English, under-resourced Indian languages remain largely unexplored. We present BHRAM-IL, a benchmark for hallucination recognition and assessment in multiple Indian languages, covering Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Odia, along with English. The benchmark comprises 36,047 curated questions across nine categories spanning factual, numerical, reasoning, and linguistic tasks. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs on a benchmark subset of 10,265 questions, analyzing cross-lingual and factual hallucinations across languages, models, scales, categories, and domains using category-specific metrics normalized to (0,1) range. Aggregation over all categories and models yields a primary score of 0.23 and a language-corrected fuzzy score of 0.385, demonstrating the usefulness of BHRAM-IL for hallucination-focused evaluation. The dataset, and the code for generation and evaluation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sambhashana/BHRAM-IL/) to support future research in multilingual hallucination detection and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Cross-Lingual Interleaving for Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) aim to learn linguistic competence directly from speech using discrete units, widening access to Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for languages with limited written resources. However, progress has been largely English-centric due to scarce spoken evaluation benchmarks and training data, making cross-lingual learning difficult. We present a cross-lingual interleaving method that mixes speech tokens across languages without textual supervision. We also release an EN-FR training dataset, TinyStories (~42k hours), together with EN-FR spoken StoryCloze and TopicCloze benchmarks for cross-lingual semantic evaluation, both synthetically generated using GPT-4. On 360M and 1B SLMs under matched training-token budgets, interleaving improves monolingual semantic accuracy, enables robust cross-lingual continuation, and strengthens cross-lingual hidden-state alignment. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-lingual interleaving is a simple, scalable route to building multilingual SLMs that understand and converse across languages. All resources will be made open-source to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Exploring Human Perceptions of AI Responses: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Study on Risk Mitigation in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.</description>

      <title>OPOR-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models on Online Public Opinion Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Public Opinion Reports consolidate news and social media for timely crisis management by governments and enterprises. While large language models have made automated report generation technically feasible, systematic research in this specific area remains notably absent, particularly lacking formal task definitions and corresponding benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we define the Automated Online Public Opinion Report Generation (OPOR-GEN) task and construct OPOR-BENCH, an event-centric dataset covering 463 crisis events with their corresponding news articles, social media posts, and a reference summary. To evaluate report quality, we propose OPOR-EVAL, a novel agent-based framework that simulates human expert evaluation by analyzing generated reports in context. Experiments with frontier models demonstrate that our framework achieves high correlation with human judgments. Our comprehensive task definition, benchmark dataset, and evaluation framework provide a solid foundation for future research in this critical domain.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the internal thinking process of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the cause of hallucinations remains a key challenge. To this end, we introduce latent debate, a novel framework for interpreting model predictions through the lens of implicit internal arguments. Unlike the current work of self-consistency and multi-agent debate, which relies on explicit debates among multiple answers or multiple models, latent debate captures the hidden supporting and attacking signals that arise within a single model during a single inference. We first present a model- and task-agnostic conceptual framework, and then instantiate it symbolically to approximate the thinking process of LLMs on True/False prediction tasks. Empirical studies demonstrate that latent debate is a faithful structured surrogate model that has highly consistent predictions with the original LLM. Beyond interpretability, we demonstrate that latent debate provides a strong baseline for hallucination detection. Further analysis reveals strong correlations between hallucinations and debate patterns, such as a high degree of latent debates in the middle layers is linked to a higher risk of hallucinations. These findings position latent debate as a potential framework for understanding internal mechanisms of LLMs, especially for scenarios where internal (dis)agreements appear during the inference steps.</description>

      <title>Rectifying LLM Thought from Lens of Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by their emergent reasoning capabilities, particularly through long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which enables thorough exploration and deliberation. Despite these advances, long-CoT LLMs often exhibit suboptimal reasoning behaviors, such as overthinking and excessively protracted reasoning chains, which can impair performance. In this paper, we analyze reasoning processes through an optimization lens, framing CoT as a gradient descent procedure where each reasoning step constitutes an update toward problem resolution. Building on this perspective, we introduce RePro (Rectifying Process-level Reward), a novel approach to refine LLM reasoning during post-training. RePro defines a surrogate objective function to assess the optimization process underlying CoT, utilizing a dual scoring mechanism to quantify its intensity and stability. These scores are aggregated into a composite process-level reward, seamlessly integrated into reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines to optimize LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and diverse LLMs, evaluated on benchmarks spanning mathematics, science, and coding, demonstrate that RePro consistently enhances reasoning performance and mitigates suboptimal reasoning behaviors.</description>

      <title>How Far Are We from Genuinely Useful Deep Research Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) aim to automatically produce analyst-level reports through iterative information retrieval and synthesis. However, most existing DRAs were validated on question-answering benchmarks, while research on generating comprehensive reports remains overlooked. Worse, current benchmarks for report synthesis suffer from task complexity and subjective metrics -- this fails to reflect user demands and limits the practical utility of generated reports. To address these gaps, we present Fine-grained DEepResearch bench (FINDER), an enhanced benchmark consisting of 100 human-curated research tasks with 419 structured checklist items that standardize report structure, analytical depth, and factual grounding. Based on approximately 1,000 reports produced by mainstream DRAs, we further propose Deep rEsearch Failure Taxonomy (DEFT), the first failure taxonomy for deep research agents. DEFT contains 14 fine-grained failure modes across reasoning, retrieval, and generation, and is built upon grounded theory with human-LLM co-annotating and inter-annotator reliability validation. Our experimental findings reveal that current DRAs struggle not with task comprehension but with evidence integration, verification, and reasoning-resilient planning.</description>

      <title>The Art of Scaling Test-Time Compute for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) -- the dynamic allocation of compute during inference -- is a promising direction for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, a systematic comparison of well-known TTS strategies under identical conditions is missing, and the influence of model type and problem difficulty on performance remains unclear. To address these gaps, we conduct the first large-scale study of TTS, spanning over thirty billion tokens generated using eight open-source LLMs (7B to 235B parameters), across four reasoning datasets. We observe three consistent trends: (1) no single TTS strategy universally dominates; (2) reasoning models exhibit distinct trace-quality patterns across problem difficulty and trace length, forming short-horizon and long-horizon categories; and (3) for a given model type, the optimal TTS performance scales monotonically with compute budget. Based on these insights, we provide a practical recipe for selecting the best TTS strategy, considering problem difficulty, model type, and compute budget, providing a practical guide to effective inference-time scaling.</description>

      <title>Four Over Six: More Accurate NVFP4 Quantization with Adaptive Block Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models have grown larger, low-precision numerical formats such as NVFP4 have become increasingly popular due to the speed and memory benefits they provide. However, to accelerate computation with NVFP4, all matrix multiplication operands--weights and activations in the forward pass, and weights, activations, and gradients in the backward pass--must be quantized to NVFP4, often leading to divergence during training and performance degradation during inference. NVFP4 by evaluating multiple potential scale factors for each block of values. To address this issue, in this work we introduce Four Over Six (4/6), a modification to the NVFP4 quantization algorithm that evaluates two potential scale factors for each block of values. Unlike integer formats, floating-point formats such as FP4 have the most quantization error on near-maximal values in each block, which we find to be primarily responsible for downstream performance degradation. We find that for some blocks, scaling to smaller FP4 values makes the distribution of representable values more uniform, improving representation of near-maximal values. Importantly, 4/6 can be implemented efficiently on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, making it viable to use while training LLMs with NVFP4. In pre-training experiments with transformer and hybrid model architectures, we find that 4/6 prevents divergence in several cases, bringing training loss significantly closer to BF16 compared to models trained with current state-of-the-art NVFP4 training recipes. We also find that 4/6 can be easily incorporated into many different post-training quantization methods and generally improves downstream accuracy. We hope this inspires future work in training and deploying models with NVFP4.</description>

      <title>VeriPy - A New Python-Based Approach for SDR Pipelined/Unrolled Hardware Accelerator Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software-defined radio (SDR) plays an important role in the communication field by providing a flexible and customized communication system for different purposes according to the needs. To enhance the performance of SDR applications, hardware accelerators have been widely deployed in recent years. In facing this obstacle, a necessity arises for a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool specifically designed for communication engineers without detailed hardware knowledge. To lower the barrier between SDR engineers and hardware development, this work proposed a Python-based HLS tool, VeriPy, which can generate both mainstream architecture for hardware accelerators in Verilog specifically for SDR designs including unrolled design and pipelined design, requiring no detailed digital hardware knowledge or Hardware Description Languages (HDL). Furthermore, VeriPy supports automatic testbench generation with random input stimulus, an extensible hardware library, performance and resource estimation, and offers strong optimisation potential at both the algorithmic and digital hardware levels. The generated hardware design by VeriPy can achieve up to 70% faster operating frequency compared to pragma-optimised Vivado HLS designs with a reasonably higher resource con-sumption while delivering comparable performance and resource consumption to hand-coded implementations. Regarding code complexity, VeriPy requires no pragmas, completely eliminating the need for low-level hardware knowledge. For straightforward algorithms, the input code length remains comparable to that of Vivado HLS.</description>

      <title>Use of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model Agent for Long-Form COVID-19 Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 infodemic calls for scalable fact-checking solutions that handle long-form misinformation with accuracy and reliability. This study presents SAFE (system for accurate fact extraction and evaluation), an agent system that combines large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve automated fact-checking of long-form COVID-19 misinformation. SAFE includes two agents - one for claim extraction and another for claim verification using LOTR-RAG, which leverages a 130,000-document COVID-19 research corpus. An enhanced variant, SAFE (LOTR-RAG + SRAG), incorporates Self-RAG to refine retrieval via query rewriting. We evaluated both systems on 50 fake news articles (2-17 pages) containing 246 annotated claims (M = 4.922, SD = 3.186), labeled as true (14.1%), partly true (14.4%), false (27.0%), partly false (2.2%), and misleading (21.0%) by public health professionals. SAFE systems significantly outperformed baseline LLMs in all metrics (p &lt; 0.001). For consistency (0-1 scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) scored 0.629, exceeding both SAFE (+SRAG) (0.577) and the baseline (0.279). In subjective evaluations (0-4 Likert scale), SAFE (LOTR-RAG) also achieved the highest average ratings in usefulness (3.640), clearness (3.800), and authenticity (3.526). Adding SRAG slightly reduced overall performance, except for a minor gain in clearness. SAFE demonstrates robust improvements in long-form COVID-19 fact-checking by addressing LLM limitations in consistency and explainability. The core LOTR-RAG design proved more effective than its SRAG-augmented variant, offering a strong foundation for scalable misinformation mitigation.</description>

      <title>LM4Opt-RA: A Multi-Candidate LLM Framework with Structured Ranking for Automating Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we can tackle complex analytical and mathematical reasoning tasks requiring nuanced contextual understanding. A prime example of such complex tasks is modelling resource allocation optimization in networks, which extends beyond translating natural language inputs into mathematical equations or Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models. However, existing benchmarks and datasets cannot address the complexities of such problems with dynamic environments, interdependent variables, and heterogeneous constraints. To address this gap, we introduce NL4RA, a curated dataset comprising 50 resource allocation optimization problems formulated as LP, ILP, and MILP. We then evaluate the performance of well-known open-source LLMs with varying parameter counts. To enhance existing LLM based methods, we introduce LM4Opt RA, a multi candidate framework that applies diverse prompting strategies such as direct, few shot, and chain of thought, combined with a structured ranking mechanism to improve accuracy. We identified discrepancies between human judgments and automated scoring such as ROUGE, BLEU, or BERT scores. However, human evaluation is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, making it impractical for a fully automated end-to-end framework. To quantify the difference between LLM-generated responses and ground truth, we introduce LLM-Assisted Mathematical Evaluation (LAME), an automated metric designed for mathematical formulations. Using LM4Opt-RA, Llama-3.1-70B achieved a LAME score of 0.8007, outperforming other models by a significant margin, followed closely by Llama-3.1-8B. While baseline LLMs demonstrate considerable promise, they still lag behind human expertise; our proposed method surpasses these baselines regarding LAME and other metrics.</description>

      <title>Closing the Gap: Data-Centric Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models for the Standardized Exam Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal reasoning has become a cornerstone of modern AI research. Standardized exam questions offer a uniquely rigorous testbed for such reasoning, providing structured visual contexts and verifiable answers. While recent progress has largely focused on algorithmic advances such as reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO, DPO), the data centric foundations of vision language reasoning remain less explored.
  We show that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data can rival proprietary approaches. To this end, we compile a 161.4 million token multimodal dataset combining textbook question-solution pairs, curriculum aligned diagrams, and contextual materials, and fine-tune Qwen-2.5VL-32B using an optimized reasoning syntax (QMSA). The resulting model achieves 78.6% accuracy, only 1.0% below Gemini 2.0 Flash, on our newly released benchmark YKSUniform, which standardizes 1,854 multimodal exam questions across 309 curriculum topics.
  Our results reveal that data composition and representational syntax play a decisive role in multimodal reasoning. This work establishes a data centric framework for advancing open weight vision language models, demonstrating that carefully curated and curriculum-grounded multimodal data can elevate supervised fine-tuning to near state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring What LLMs Think They Do: SHAP Faithfulness and Deployability on Financial Tabular Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for classification tasks, offering a flexible alternative to trusted classical machine learning models like LightGBM through zero-shot prompting. However, their reliability for structured tabular data remains unclear, particularly in high stakes applications like financial risk assessment. Our study systematically evaluates LLMs and generates their SHAP values on financial classification tasks. Our analysis shows a divergence between LLMs self-explanation of feature impact and their SHAP values, as well as notable differences between LLMs and LightGBM SHAP values. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone classifiers for structured financial modeling, but also instill optimism that improved explainability mechanisms coupled with few-shot prompting will make LLMs usable in risk-sensitive domains.</description>

      <title>Challenges of Heterogeneity in Big Data: A Comparative Study of Classification in Large-Scale Structured and Unstructured Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes the impact of heterogeneity ("Variety") in Big Data by comparing classification strategies across structured (Epsilon) and unstructured (Rest-Mex, IMDB) domains. A dual methodology was implemented: evolutionary and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (Genetic Algorithms, Optuna) in Python for numerical data, and distributed processing in Apache Spark for massive textual corpora. The results reveal a "complexity paradox": in high-dimensional spaces, optimized linear models (SVM, Logistic Regression) outperformed deep architectures and Gradient Boosting. Conversely, in text-based domains, the constraints of distributed fine-tuning led to overfitting in complex models, whereas robust feature engineering -- specifically Transformer-based embeddings (ROBERTa) and Bayesian Target Encoding -- enabled simpler models to generalize effectively. This work provides a unified framework for algorithm selection based on data nature and infrastructure constraints.</description>

      <title>Progressive Code Integration for Abstractive Bug Report Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bug reports are often unstructured and verbose, making it challenging for developers to efficiently comprehend software issues. Existing summarization approaches typically rely on surface-level textual cues, resulting in incomplete or redundant summaries, and they frequently ignore associated code snippets, which are essential for accurate defect diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a progressive code-integration framework for LLM-based abstractive bug report summarization. Our approach incrementally incorporates long code snippets alongside textual content, overcoming standard LLM context window constraints and producing semantically rich summaries. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets using eight LLMs, our pipeline outperforms extractive baselines by 7.5%-58.2% and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art abstractive methods, highlighting the benefits of jointly leveraging textual and code information for enhanced bug comprehension.</description>

      <title>Breaking It Down: Domain-Aware Semantic Segmentation for Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Document chunking is a crucial component of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), as it directly affects the retrieval of relevant and precise context. Conventional fixed-length and recursive splitters often produce arbitrary, incoherent segments that fail to preserve semantic structure. Although semantic chunking has gained traction, its influence on generation quality remains underexplored. This paper introduces two efficient semantic chunking methods, Projected Similarity Chunking (PSC) and Metric Fusion Chunking (MFC), trained on PubMed data using three different embedding models. We further present an evaluation framework that measures the effect of chunking on both retrieval and generation by augmenting PubMedQA with full-text PubMed Central articles. Our results show substantial retrieval improvements (24x with PSC) in MRR and higher Hits@k on PubMedQA. We provide a comprehensive analysis, including statistical significance and response-time comparisons with common chunking libraries. Despite being trained on a single domain, PSC and MFC also generalize well, achieving strong out-of-domain generation performance across multiple datasets. Overall, our findings confirm that our semantic chunkers, especially PSC, consistently deliver superior performance.</description>

      <title>Whose Personae? Synthetic Persona Experiments in LLM Research and Pathways to Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic personae experiments have become a prominent method in Large Language Model alignment research, yet the representativeness and ecological validity of these personae vary considerably between studies. Through a review of 63 peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and 2025 in leading NLP and AI venues, we reveal a critical gap: task and population of interest are often underspecified in persona-based experiments, despite personalization being fundamentally dependent on these criteria. Our analysis shows substantial differences in user representation, with most studies focusing on limited sociodemographic attributes and only 35% discussing the representativeness of their LLM personae. Based on our findings, we introduce a persona transparency checklist that emphasizes representative sampling, explicit grounding in empirical data, and enhanced ecological validity. Our work provides both a comprehensive assessment of current practices and practical guidelines to improve the rigor and ecological validity of persona-based evaluations in language model alignment research.</description>

      <title>Rep3Net: An Approach Exploiting Multimodal Representation for Molecular Bioactivity Prediction</title>

Abstract: In early stage drug discovery, bioactivity prediction of molecules against target proteins plays a crucial role. Trdaitional QSAR models that utilizes molecular descriptor based data often struggles to predict bioactivity of molecules effectively due to its limitation in capturing structural and contextual information embedded within each compound. To address this challenge, we propose Rep3Net, a unified deep learning architecture that not only incorporates descriptor data but also includes spatial and relational information through graph-based represenation of compounds and contextual information through ChemBERTa generated embeddings from SMILES strings. Our model employing multimodal concatenated features produce reliable bioactivity prediction on Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) dataset. PARP-1 is a crucial agent in DNA damage repair and has become a significant theraputic target in malignancies that depend on it for survival and growth. A comprehensive analysis and comparison with conventional standalone models including GCN, GAT, XGBoost, etc. demonstrates that our architecture achieves the highest predictive performance. In computational screening of compounds in drug discovery, our architecture provides a scalable framework for bioactivity prediction.</description>

      <title>Bias Testing and Mitigation in Black Box LLMs using Metamorphic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about subtle social biases embedded in their outputs. Existing guardrails often fail when faced with indirect or contextually complex bias-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework for both systematic bias evaluation and targeted mitigation. Our approach introduces six novel Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that, based on metamorphic testing principles, transform direct bias-inducing inputs into semantically equivalent yet adversarially challenging variants. These transformations enable an automated method for exposing hidden model biases: when an LLM responds inconsistently or unfairly across MR-generated variants, the underlying bias becomes detectable. We further show that the same MRs can be used to generate diverse bias-inducing samples for fine-tuning, directly linking the testing process to mitigation. Using six state-of-the-art LLMs - spanning open-source and proprietary models - and a representative subset of 385 questions from the 8,978-item BiasAsker benchmark covering seven protected groups, our MRs reveal up to 14% more hidden biases compared to existing tools. Moreover, fine-tuning with both original and MR-mutated samples significantly enhances bias resiliency, increasing safe response rates from 54.7% to over 88.9% across models. These results highlight metamorphic relations as a practical mechanism for improving fairness in conversational AI.</description>

      <title>Statistical NLP for Optimization of Clinical Trial Success Prediction in Pharmaceutical R&amp;D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the development and evaluation of an NLP-enabled probabilistic classifier designed to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success (pTRS) for clinical trials in the field of neuroscience. While pharmaceutical R&amp;D is plagued by high attrition rates and enormous costs, particularly within neuroscience, where success rates are below 10%, timely identification of promising programs can streamline resource allocation and reduce financial risk. Leveraging data from the ClinicalTrials.gov database and success labels from the recently developed Clinical Trial Outcome dataset, the classifier extracts text-based clinical trial features using statistical NLP techniques. These features were integrated into several non-LLM frameworks (logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest) to generate calibrated probability scores. Model performance was assessed on a retrospective dataset of 101,145 completed clinical trials spanning 1976-2024, achieving an overall ROC-AUC of 0.64. An LLM-based predictive model was then built using BioBERT, a domain-specific language representation encoder. The BioBERT-based model achieved an overall ROC-AUC of 0.74 and a Brier Score of 0.185, indicating its predictions had, on average, 40% less squared error than would be observed using industry benchmarks. The BioBERT-based model also made trial outcome predictions that were superior to benchmark values 70% of the time overall. By integrating NLP-driven insights into drug development decision-making, this work aims to enhance strategic planning and optimize investment allocation in neuroscience programs.</description>

      <title>Melody or Machine: Detecting Synthetic Music with Dual-Stream Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of end-to-end AI music generation poses an escalating threat to artistic authenticity and copyright, demanding detection methods that can keep pace. While foundational, existing models like SpecTTTra falter when faced with the diverse and rapidly advancing ecosystem of new generators, exhibiting significant performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) content. This generalization failure highlights a critical gap: the need for more challenging benchmarks and more robust detection architectures. To address this, we first introduce Melody or Machine (MoM), a new large-scale benchmark of over 130,000 songs (6,665 hours). MoM is the most diverse dataset to date, built with a mix of open and closed-source models and a curated OOD test set designed specifically to foster the development of truly generalizable detectors. Alongside this benchmark, we introduce CLAM, a novel dual-stream detection architecture. We hypothesize that subtle, machine-induced inconsistencies between vocal and instrumental elements, often imperceptible in a mixed signal, offer a powerful tell-tale sign of synthesis. CLAM is designed to test this hypothesis by employing two distinct pre-trained audio encoders (MERT and Wave2Vec2) to create parallel representations of the audio. These representations are fused by a learnable cross-aggregation module that models their inter-dependencies. The model is trained with a dual-loss objective: a standard binary cross-entropy loss for classification, complemented by a contrastive triplet loss which trains the model to distinguish between coherent and artificially mismatched stream pairings, enhancing its sensitivity to synthetic artifacts without presuming a simple feature alignment. CLAM establishes a new state-of-the-art in synthetic music forensics. It achieves an F1 score of 0.925 on our challenging MoM benchmark.</description>

      <title>Probing the "Psyche'' of Large Reasoning Models: Understanding Through a Human Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their exceptional capability in addressing complex tasks. Motivated by the observed human-like behaviors in their reasoning processes, this paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy to characterize atomic reasoning steps and probe the ``psyche'' of LRM intelligence. Specifically, it comprises five groups and seventeen categories derived from human mental processes, thereby grounding the understanding of LRMs in an interdisciplinary perspective. The taxonomy is then applied for an in-depth understanding of current LRMs, resulting in a distinct labeled dataset that comprises 277,534 atomic reasoning steps. Using this resource, we analyze contemporary LRMs and distill several actionable takeaways for improving training and post-training of reasoning models. Notably, our analysis reveals that prevailing post-answer ``double-checks'' (self-monitoring evaluations) are largely superficial and rarely yield substantive revisions. Thus, incentivizing comprehensive multi-step reflection, rather than simple self-monitoring, may offer a more effective path forward. To complement the taxonomy, an automatic annotation framework, named CAPO, is proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for generating the taxonomy-based annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that CAPO achieves higher consistency with human experts compared to baselines, facilitating a scalable and comprehensive analysis of LRMs from a human cognitive perspective. Together, the taxonomy, CAPO, and the derived insights provide a principled, scalable path toward understanding and advancing LRM reasoning.</description>

      <title>Text Mining Analysis of Symptom Patterns in Medical Chatbot Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast growth of digital health systems has led to a need to better comprehend how they interpret and represent patient-reported symptoms. Chatbots have been used in healthcare to provide clinical support and enhance the user experience, making it possible to provide meaningful clinical patterns from text-based data through chatbots. The proposed research utilises several different natural language processing methods to study the occurrences of symptom descriptions in medicine as well as analyse the patterns that emerge through these conversations within medical bots. Through the use of the Medical Conversations to Disease Dataset which contains 960 multi-turn dialogues divided into 24 Clinical Conditions, a standardised representation of conversations between patient and bot is created for further analysis by computational means. The multi-method approach uses a variety of tools, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify latent symptom themes, K-Means to group symptom descriptions by similarity, Transformer-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract medical concepts, and the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent symptom pairs. Findings from the analysis indicate a coherent structure of clinically relevant topics, moderate levels of clustering cohesiveness and several high confidence rates on the relationships between symptoms like fever headache and rash itchiness. The results support the notion that conversational medical data can be a valuable diagnostic signal for early symptom interpretation, assist in strengthening decision support and improve how users interact with tele-health technology. By demonstrating a method for converting unstructured free-flowing dialogue into actionable knowledge regarding symptoms this work provides an extensible framework to further enhance future performance, dependability and clinical utility of selecting medical chatbots.</description>

      <title>One Swallow Does Not Make a Summer: Understanding Semantic Structures in Embedding Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding spaces are fundamental to modern AI, translating raw data into high-dimensional vectors that encode rich semantic relationships. Yet, their internal structures remain opaque, with existing approaches often sacrificing semantic coherence for structural regularity or incurring high computational overhead to improve interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce the Semantic Field Subspace (SFS), a geometry-preserving, context-aware representation that captures local semantic neighborhoods within the embedding space. We also propose SAFARI (SemAntic Field subspAce deteRmInation), an unsupervised, modality-agnostic algorithm that uncovers hierarchical semantic structures using a novel metric called Semantic Shift, which quantifies how semantics evolve as SFSes evolve. To ensure scalability, we develop an efficient approximation of Semantic Shift that replaces costly SVD computations, achieving a 15~30x speedup with average errors below 0.01. Extensive evaluations across six real-world text and image datasets show that SFSes outperform standard classifiers not only in classification but also in nuanced tasks such as political bias detection, while SAFARI consistently reveals interpretable and generalizable semantic hierarchies. This work presents a unified framework for structuring, analyzing, and scaling semantic understanding in embedding spaces.</description>

      <title>Towards Active Synthetic Data Generation for Finetuning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common and effective means for improving language model capabilities involves finetuning a ``student'' language model's parameters on generations from a more proficient ``teacher'' model. Termed ``synthetic data'', these generations are often produced before any student finetuning, but some work has considered generating new synthetic samples as training progresses. This paper studies and advocates for the latter case, where data are generated in an iterative, closed-loop fashion that is guided by the current state of the student model. For a fixed budget of generated samples, or a budget in terms of compute spent querying a teacher, we show that this curation of finetuning data affords improved student performance over static generation. Further, while there have been several LLM-specific methods proposed that operate in this regime, we find that simple, inexpensive selection criteria from the active learning literature tend to be most performant. We validate these claims across four mathematical and logical reasoning datasets using four different small language models.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Legal Reasoning Traces with Legal Issue Tree Rubrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the quality of LLM-generated reasoning traces in expert domains (e.g., law) is essential for ensuring credibility and explainability, yet remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of such reasoning tasks. We introduce LEGIT (LEGal Issue Trees), a novel large-scale (24K instances) expert-level legal reasoning dataset with an emphasis on reasoning trace evaluation. We convert court judgments into hierarchical trees of opposing parties' arguments and the court's conclusions, which serve as rubrics for evaluating the issue coverage and correctness of the reasoning traces. We verify the reliability of these rubrics via human expert annotations and comparison with coarse, less informative rubrics. Using the LEGIT dataset, we show that (1) LLMs' legal reasoning ability is seriously affected by both legal issue coverage and correctness, and that (2) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and RL with rubrics bring complementary benefits for legal reasoning abilities, where RAG improves overall reasoning capability, whereas RL improves correctness albeit with reduced coverage.</description>

      <title>Associative Syntax and Maximal Repetitions reveal context-dependent complexity in fruit bat communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised method to infer discreteness, syntax and temporal structures of fruit-bats vocalizations, as a case study of graded vocal systems, and evaluates the complexity of communication patterns in relation with behavioral context. The method improved the baseline for unsupervised labeling of vocal units (i.e. syllables) through manifold learning, by investigating how dimen- sionality reduction on mel-spectrograms affects labeling, and comparing it with unsupervised labels based on acoustic similarity. We then encoded vocalizations as syllabic sequences to analyze the type of syntax, and extracted the Maximal Repetitions (MRs) to evaluate syntactical structures. We found evidence for: i) associative syntax, rather than combinatorial (context classification is unaffected by permutation of sequences, F 1 &gt; 0.9); ii) context-dependent use of syllables (Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, p-value &lt; 0.05); iii) heavy-tail distribution of MRs (truncated power-law, exponent {\alpha} &lt; 2), indicative of mechanism encoding com- binatorial complexity. Analysis of MRs and syllabic transition networks revealed that mother-pupil interactions were characterized by repetitions, while commu- nication in conflict-contexts exhibited higher complexity (longer MRs and more interconnected vocal sequences) than non-agonistic contexts. We propose that communicative complexity is higher in scenarios of disagreement, reflecting lower compressibility of information.</description>

      <title>Testing the Machine Consciousness Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Machine Consciousness Hypothesis states that consciousness is a substrate-free functional property of computational systems capable of second-order perception. I propose a research program to investigate this idea in silico by studying how collective self-models (coherent, self-referential representations) emerge from distributed learning systems embedded within universal self-organizing environments. The theory outlined here starts from the supposition that consciousness is an emergent property of collective intelligence systems undergoing synchronization of prediction through communication. It is not an epiphenomenon of individual modeling but a property of the language that a system evolves to internally describe itself. For a model of base reality, I begin with a minimal but general computational world: a cellular automaton, which exhibits both computational irreducibility and local reducibility. On top of this computational substrate, I introduce a network of local, predictive, representational (neural) models capable of communication and adaptation. I use this layered model to study how collective intelligence gives rise to self-representation as a direct consequence of inter-agent alignment. I suggest that consciousness does not emerge from modeling per se, but from communication. It arises from the noisy, lossy exchange of predictive messages between groups of local observers describing persistent patterns in the underlying computational substrate (base reality). It is through this representational dialogue that a shared model arises, aligning many partial views of the world. The broader goal is to develop empirically testable theories of machine consciousness, by studying how internal self-models may form in distributed systems without centralized control.</description>

      <title>Generalized Medical Phrase Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical phrase grounding (MPG) maps textual descriptions of radiological findings to corresponding image regions. These grounded reports are easier to interpret, especially for non-experts. Existing MPG systems mostly follow the referring expression comprehension (REC) paradigm and return exactly one bounding box per phrase. Real reports often violate this assumption. They contain multi-region findings, non-diagnostic text, and non-groundable phrases, such as negations or descriptions of normal anatomy. Motivated by this, we reformulate the task as generalised medical phrase grounding (GMPG), where each sentence is mapped to zero, one, or multiple scored regions. To realise this formulation, we introduce the first GMPG model: MedGrounder. We adopted a two-stage training regime: pre-training on report sentence--anatomy box alignment datasets and fine-tuning on report sentence--human annotated box datasets. Experiments on PadChest-GR and MS-CXR show that MedGrounder achieves strong zero-shot transfer and outperforms REC-style and grounded report generation baselines on multi-region and non-groundable phrases, while using far fewer human box annotations. Finally, we show that MedGrounder can be composed with existing report generators to produce grounded reports without retraining the generator.</description>

      <title>Mode-Conditioning Unlocks Superior Test-Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel sampling promises substantial gains in test-time scaling, but its effectiveness is sharply limited by diversity collapse, where models concentrate on a few modes and repeated samples produce the same mistakes. We propose the mode-conditioning (ModC) framework, which explicitly allocates test-time compute across reasoning modes using either specialist models or mode-specific prefixes. ModC consistently improves scaling across controlled graph-search tasks and large-scale reasoning benchmarks, spanning model families and sizes from 0.5B to 7B. On OpenThoughts, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B with ModC achieves a 4x efficiency gain over standard training while also improving the maximum attainable Pass@k. We further show that gradient clustering enables ModC without explicit mode labels, yielding up to 10% gains on datasets such as NuminaMath. Finally, we show that ModC improves reinforcement learning (RL) and can further boost diversity-inducing RL methods. These results demonstrate that standard training underutilizes the diversity in data, and that ModC provides a simple, effective remedy for unlocking the full benefits of diversity in test-time scaling.</description>

Abstract: Standard Transformers suffer from a "Semantic Alignment Tax", a prohibitive optimization cost required to organize a chaotic initialization into a coherent geometric map via local gradient diffusion. We hypothesize that this reliance on diffusive learning creates "Catastrophic Rigidity", rendering models unable to adapt to novel concepts without destroying their pre-trained reasoning capabilities. To isolate this phenomenon, we introduce Iterative Semantic Map Refinement (ISMR), a diagnostic protocol revealing that alignment is a fixed geometric barrier that scaling cannot solve; a 20-layer model overcomes this barrier no faster than a 1-layer model. We introduce the Phase-Resonant Intelligent Spectral Model (PRISM). PRISM encodes semantic identity as resonant frequencies in the complex domain (C^d) and replaces quadratic self-attention with linearithmic O(N log N) Gated Harmonic Convolutions. We validate PRISM on the WMT14 translation task. While the Standard Transformer maintains a slight edge in general competence on static benchmarks (23.88 vs 21.40 BLEU), it fails the "Plasticity-Stability" stress test completely. When injected with novel concepts, the Transformer suffers Catastrophic Forgetting, degrading by -10.55 BLEU points while achieving only 60% acquisition. In contrast, PRISM demonstrates Lossless Plasticity, achieving 96% 5-shot acquisition with negligible degradation (-0.84 BLEU). These results suggest that harmonic representations effectively decouple memory from reasoning, offering a structural solution to the plasticity-stability dilemma in real-time knowledge adaptation.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Gumbel MCTS for Abstract Visual Composition Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study abstract visual composition, in which identity is primarily determined by the spatial configuration and relations among a small set of geometric primitives (e.g., parts, symmetry, topology). They are invariant primarily to texture and photorealistic detail. Composing such structures from fixed components under geometric constraints and vague goal specification (such as text) is non-trivial due to combinatorial placement choices, limited data, and discrete feasibility (overlap-free, allowable orientations), which create a sparse solution manifold ill-suited to purely statistical pixel-space generators. We propose a constraint-guided framework that combines explicit geometric reasoning with neural semantics. An AlphaGo-style search enforces feasibility, while a fine-tuned vision-language model scores semantic alignment as reward signals. Our algorithm uses a policy network as a heuristic in Monte-Carlo Tree Search and fine-tunes the network via search-generated plans. Inspired by the Generative Adversarial Network, we use the generated instances for adversarial reward refinement. Over time, the generation should approach the actual data more closely when the reward model cannot distinguish between generated instances and ground-truth. In the Tangram Assembly task, our approach yields higher validity and semantic fidelity than diffusion and auto-regressive baselines, especially as constraints tighten.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Cannot Reliably Detect Vulnerabilities in JavaScript: The First Systematic Benchmark and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect vulnerabilities in JavaScript, especially those assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the actual capability of LLMs in JavaScript vulnerability detection remains questionable, necessitating systematic evaluation and comprehensive benchmarks. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks suffer from three critical limitations: (1) incomplete coverage, such as covering a limited subset of CWE types; (2) underestimation of LLM capabilities caused by unreasonable ground truth labeling; and (3) overestimation due to unrealistic cases such as using isolated vulnerable files rather than complete projects.
  In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, three principles for constructing a benchmark for JavaScript vulnerability detection that directly address these limitations: (1) comprehensiveness, (2) no underestimation, and (3) no overestimation. Guided by these principles, we propose FORGEJS, the first automatic benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLMs' capability in JavaScript vulnerability detection. Then, we use FORGEJS to construct ARENAJS-the first systematic benchmark for LLM-based JavaScript vulnerability detection-and further propose JUDGEJS, an automatic evaluation framework.
  We conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for JavaScript vulnerability detection, leveraging JUDGEJS to assess seven popular commercial LLMs on ARENAJS. The results show that LLMs not only exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, but also suffer from severe robustness defects, indicating that reliable JavaScript vulnerability detection with LLMs remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>Securing Large Language Models (LLMs) from Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in real-world applications, but their flexibility exposes them to prompt injection attacks. These attacks leverage the model's instruction-following ability to make it perform malicious tasks. Recent work has proposed JATMO, a task-specific fine-tuning approach that trains non-instruction-tuned base models to perform a single function, thereby reducing susceptibility to adversarial instructions. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of JATMO against HOUYI, a genetic attack framework that systematically mutates and optimizes adversarial prompts. We adapt HOUYI by introducing custom fitness scoring, modified mutation logic, and a new harness for local model testing, enabling a more accurate assessment of defense effectiveness. We fine-tuned LLaMA 2-7B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-0.5B models under the JATMO methodology and compared them with a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo baseline. Results show that while JATMO reduces attack success rates relative to instruction-tuned models, it does not fully prevent injections; adversaries exploiting multilingual cues or code-related disruptors still bypass defenses. We also observe a trade-off between generation quality and injection vulnerability, suggesting that better task performance often correlates with increased susceptibility. Our results highlight both the promise and limitations of fine-tuning-based defenses and point toward the need for layered, adversarially informed mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>EmoRAG: Evaluating RAG Robustness to Symbolic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly central to robust AI, enhancing large language model (LLM) faithfulness by incorporating external knowledge. However, our study unveils a critical, overlooked vulnerability: their profound susceptibility to subtle symbolic perturbations, particularly through near-imperceptible emoticon tokens such as "(@_@)" that can catastrophically mislead retrieval, termed EmoRAG. We demonstrate that injecting a single emoticon into a query makes it nearly 100% likely to retrieve semantically unrelated texts that contain a matching emoticon. Our extensive experiment across general question-answering and code domains, using a range of state-of-the-art retrievers and generators, reveals three key findings: (I) Single-Emoticon Disaster: Minimal emoticon injections cause maximal disruptions, with a single emoticon almost 100% dominating RAG output. (II) Positional Sensitivity: Placing an emoticon at the beginning of a query can cause severe perturbation, with F1-Scores exceeding 0.92 across all datasets. (III) Parameter-Scale Vulnerability: Counterintuitively, models with larger parameters exhibit greater vulnerability to the interference. We provide an in-depth analysis to uncover the underlying mechanisms of these phenomena. Furthermore, we raise a critical concern regarding the robustness assumption of current RAG systems, envisioning a threat scenario where an adversary exploits this vulnerability to manipulate the RAG system. We evaluate standard defenses and find them insufficient against EmoRAG. To address this, we propose targeted defenses, analyzing their strengths and limitations in mitigating emoticon-based perturbations. Finally, we outline future directions for building robust RAG systems.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC &gt; 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>BackportBench: A Multilingual Benchmark for Automated Backporting of Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern software projects evolve rapidly to incorporate new features and security patches. It is important for users to update their dependencies to safer versions, but many still use older, vulnerable package versions because upgrading can be difficult and may break their existing codebase. Software developers can mitigate this problem by backporting security patches to older releases. However, manually backporting is time-consuming and error-prone. The effectiveness of existing automated backporting techniques on general software remains unclear since they typically target only code-hunk or function-level patch porting scenarios and are evaluated with imperfect metrics.
  To facilitate the development and evaluation of automated backporting techniques, we introduce BackportBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for patch backporting problem. BackportBench is a multilingual benchmark that contains 202 patch backporting problems from PyPI, Maven, and npm, each with executable Docker environments and relevant test cases. We evaluated existing patch porting methods and LLM-based techniques that have the potential to adapt to this task using BackportBench. The results show that the agentic method has outperformed traditional patch porting methods, especially on cases that require logical and structural changes. However, the performance varies across different programming languages. Based on the findings, we draw several implications for researchers and software practitioners in future work on automated backporting.</description>

      <title>ZIP-RC: Zero-overhead Inference-time Prediction of Reward and Cost for Adaptive and Interpretable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel at reasoning but lack key aspects of introspection, including anticipating their own success and the computation required to achieve it. Humans use real-time introspection to decide how much effort to invest, when to make multiple attempts, when to stop, and when to signal success or failure. Without this, LLMs struggle to make intelligent meta-cognition decisions. Test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N drive up cost and latency by using a fixed budget of samples regardless of the marginal benefit of each one at any point in generation, and the absence of confidence signals can mislead people, prevent appropriate escalation to better tools, and undermine trustworthiness. Learned verifiers or reward models can provide confidence estimates, but do not enable adaptive inference and add substantial cost by requiring extra models or forward passes. We present ZIP-RC, an adaptive inference method that equips models with zero-overhead inference-time predictions of reward and cost. At every token, ZIP-RC reuses reserved or unused logits in the same forward pass as next-token prediction to output a joint distribution over final reward and remaining length -- no extra models, architecture change, or inference overhead. This full joint distribution is used to compute a sampling utility which is the linear combination of the expected maximum reward, total compute, and latency of set of samples if generated to completion. During inference, we maximize this utility with meta-actions that determine which prefix of tokens to continue or initiate sampling from. On mixed-difficulty mathematical benchmarks, ZIP-RC improves accuracy by up to 12% over majority voting at equal or lower average cost, and traces smooth Pareto frontiers between quality, compute, and latency. By providing real-time reward-cost introspection, ZIP-RC enables adaptive, efficient reasoning.</description>

      <title>LPCD: Unified Framework from Layer-Wise to Submodule Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) aims to preserve model-level behavior; however, most methods focus on individual linear layers. Even recent extensions, such as QEP and LoaQ, which mitigate error propagation or target specific submodules, still rely on layer-wise formulations and fail to capture the behavior of larger submodules. We introduce Layer-Projected Coordinate Descent (LPCD), a unified framework that extends PTQ beyond layers by optimizing relaxed objectives across arbitrary submodules and projecting the solutions with layer-wise quantizers. LPCD generalizes existing methods and provides a principled approach to quantizing complex submodules while maintaining the efficiency and compatibility of layer-wise PTQ pipelines. Across diverse LLM architectures and bit-widths, LPCD-based submodule quantization consistently enhances both layer-wise PTQ methods and existing submodule approaches.</description>

      <title>LEC: Linear Expectation Constraints for False-Discovery Control in Selective Prediction and Routing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate unreliable answers, while heuristic uncertainty methods fail to fully distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, causing users to accept erroneous answers without statistical guarantees. We address this issue through the lens of false discovery rate (FDR) control, ensuring that among all accepted predictions, the proportion of errors does not exceed a target risk level. To achieve this in a principled way, we propose LEC, which reinterprets selective prediction as a constrained decision problem by enforcing a Linear Expectation Constraint over selection and error indicators. Then, we establish a finite-sample sufficient condition, which relies only on a held-out set of exchangeable calibration samples, to compute an FDR-constrained, coverage-maximizing threshold. Furthermore, we extend LEC to a two-model routing mechanism: given a prompt, if the current model's uncertainty exceeds its calibrated threshold, we delegate it to a stronger model, while maintaining a unified FDR guarantee. Evaluations on closed-ended and open-ended question-answering (QA) datasets show that LEC achieves tighter FDR control and substantially improves sample retention over prior methods. Moreover, the two-model routing mechanism achieves lower risk levels while accepting more correct samples than each individual model.</description>

      <title>HalluGraph: Auditable Hallucination Detection for Legal RAG Systems via Knowledge Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal AI systems powered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face a critical accountability challenge: when an AI assistant cites case law, statutes, or contractual clauses, practitioners need verifiable guarantees that generated text faithfully represents source documents. Existing hallucination detectors rely on semantic similarity metrics that tolerate entity substitutions, a dangerous failure mode when confusing parties, dates, or legal provisions can have material consequences. We introduce HalluGraph, a graph-theoretic framework that quantifies hallucinations through structural alignment between knowledge graphs extracted from context, query, and response. Our approach produces bounded, interpretable metrics decomposed into \textit{Entity Grounding} (EG), measuring whether entities in the response appear in source documents, and \textit{Relation Preservation} (RP), verifying that asserted relationships are supported by context. On structured control documents, HalluGraph achieves near-perfect discrimination ($&gt;$400 words, $&gt;$20 entities), HalluGraph achieves $AUC = 0.979$, while maintaining robust performance ($AUC \approx 0.89$) on challenging generative legal task, consistently outperforming semantic similarity baselines. The framework provides the transparency and traceability required for high-stakes legal applications, enabling full audit trails from generated assertions back to source passages.</description>

      <title>StreamGaze: Gaze-Guided Temporal Reasoning and Proactive Understanding in Streaming Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than $0.1\%$ of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.</description>

      <title>Agentic Policy Optimization via Instruction-Policy Co-Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), enabling autonomous agents that can conduct effective multi-turn and tool-integrated reasoning. While instructions serve as the primary protocol for defining agents, RLVR typically relies on static and manually designed instructions. However, those instructions may be suboptimal for the base model, and the optimal instruction may change as the agent's policy improves and explores the interaction with the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce INSPO, a novel Instruction-Policy co-evolution framework that integrates instruction optimization as a dynamic component of the reinforcement learning (RL) loop. INSPO maintains a dynamic population of instruction candidates that are sampled with questions, where reward signals in RL loops are automatically attributed to each instruction, and low performers are periodically pruned. New instructions are generated and verified through an on-policy reflection mechanism, where an LLM-based optimizer analyzes past experience from a replay buffer and evolves more effective strategies given the current policy. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-turn retrieval and reasoning tasks, demonstrating that INSPO substantially outperforms strong baselines relying on static instructions. INSPO discovers innovative instructions that guide the agent toward more strategic reasoning paths, achieving substantial performance gains with only a marginal increase in computational overhead.</description>

      <title>From Atomic to Composite: Reinforcement Learning Enables Generalization in Complementary Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism by which RL contributes to reasoning capabilities-whether it incentivizes the synthesis of new skills or merely amplifies existing behaviors-remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we investigate this question through the lens of Complementary Reasoning, a complex task that requires integrating internal parametric knowledge with external contextual information. Using a controlled synthetic dataset of human biographies, we strictly decouple this ability into two atomic skills: Parametric Reasoning (relying on internal knowledge) and Contextual Reasoning (depending on external information). To rigorously assess capability boundaries, we evaluate generalization across three distinct levels of difficulty: I.I.D., Composition, and Zero-shot settings. We find that while SFT is sufficient for in-distribution performance, it struggles with O.O.D. generalization, particularly in Zero-shot settings where relational combinations are novel. Crucially, we identify the SFT Generalization Paradox: Models supervised solely on the composite task achieve near-perfect in-distribution accuracy but collapse on out-of-distribution generalization, indicating their reliance on rote memorization of path shortcuts. In contrast, we find that RL acts as a reasoning synthesizer rather than a probability amplifier. However, we uncover a strict atomic prerequisite: RL can only synthesize these complex strategies if the base model has first mastered the independent atomic skills (Parametric and Contextual) via SFT. These findings challenge the view of RL as a mere amplifier, suggesting that given sufficient atomic foundations, RL can actively synthesize complex reasoning strategies from learned primitives without explicit supervision on such complex strategies. This indicates that decoupled atomic training followed by RL offers a scalable path to generalization for complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Ground: Improving GUI Grounding via Iterative Reasoning and Reference Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GUI grounding aims to align natural language instructions with precise regions in complex user interfaces. Advanced multimodal large language models show strong ability in visual GUI grounding but still struggle with small or visually similar targets and ambiguity in real world layouts. These limitations arise from limited grounding capacity and from underuse of existing reasoning potential. We present Chain of Ground CoG a training free multi step grounding framework that uses multimodal large language models for iterative visual reasoning and refinement. Instead of direct prediction the model progressively reflects and adjusts its hypotheses leading to more accurate and interpretable localization. Our approach achieves 68.4 accuracy on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark an improvement of 4.8 points. To measure real world generalization we introduce TPanel UI a dataset of 420 labeled industrial control panels with visual distortions such as blur and masking. On TPanel UI Chain of Ground improves over the strong baseline Qwen3 VL 235B by 6.9 points showing the effectiveness of multi step training free grounding across real world and digital interfaces. These results highlight a direction for unlocking grounding potential through structured iterative refinement instead of additional training.</description>

      <title>LLM CHESS: Benchmarking Reasoning and Instruction-Following in LLMs through Chess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM CHESS, an evaluation framework designed to probe the generalization of reasoning and instruction-following abilities in large language models (LLMs) through extended agentic interaction in the domain of chess. We rank over 50 open and closed source models by playing against a random opponent using a range of behavioral metrics, including win and loss rates, move quality, move legality, hallucinated actions, and game duration. For a subset of top reasoning models, we derive an Elo estimate by playing against a chess engine with variably configured skill, which allows for comparisons between models in an easily understandable way. Despite the simplicity of the instruction-following task and the weakness of the opponent, many state-of-the-art models struggle to complete games or achieve consistent wins. Similar to other benchmarks on complex reasoning tasks, our experiments reveal a clear separation between reasoning and non-reasoning models. However, unlike existing static benchmarks, the stochastic and dynamic nature of LLM CHESS uniquely reduces overfitting and memorization while preventing benchmark saturation, proving difficult even for top reasoning models. To support future work on evaluating reasoning and instruction-following in LLMs, we release our experimental framework, a public leaderboard, and a dataset of associated games.</description>

      <title>AlignSAE: Concept-Aligned Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode factual knowledge within hidden parametric spaces that are difficult to inspect or control. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a "pre-train, then post-train" curriculum. After an initial unsupervised training phase, we apply supervised post-training to bind specific concepts to dedicated latent slots while preserving the remaining capacity for general reconstruction. This separation creates an interpretable interface where specific relations can be inspected and controlled without interference from unrelated features. Empirical results demonstrate that AlignSAE enables precise causal interventions, such as reliable "concept swaps", by targeting single, semantically aligned slots.</description>

      <title>DeID-GPT: Zero-shot Medical Text De-Identification by GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digitization of healthcare has facilitated the sharing and re-using of medical data but has also raised concerns about confidentiality and privacy. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates removing re-identifying information before the dissemination of medical records. Thus, effective and efficient solutions for de-identifying medical data, especially those in free-text forms, are highly needed. While various computer-assisted de-identification methods, including both rule-based and learning-based, have been developed and used in prior practice, such solutions still lack generalizability or need to be fine-tuned according to different scenarios, significantly imposing restrictions in wider use. The advancement of large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have shown great potential in processing text data in the medical domain with zero-shot in-context learning, especially in the task of privacy protection, as these models can identify confidential information by their powerful named entity recognition (NER) capability. In this work, we developed a novel GPT4-enabled de-identification framework (``DeID-GPT") to automatically identify and remove the identifying information. Compared to existing commonly used medical text data de-identification methods, our developed DeID-GPT showed the highest accuracy and remarkable reliability in masking private information from the unstructured medical text while preserving the original structure and meaning of the text. This study is one of the earliest to utilize ChatGPT and GPT-4 for medical text data processing and de-identification, which provides insights for further research and solution development on the use of LLMs such as ChatGPT/GPT-4 in healthcare. Codes and benchmarking data information are available at https://github.com/yhydhx/ChatGPT-API.</description>

      <title>Template-assisted Contrastive Learning of Task-oriented Dialogue Sentence Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning high quality sentence embeddings from dialogues has drawn increasing attentions as it is essential to solve a variety of dialogue-oriented tasks with low annotation cost. Annotating and gathering utterance relationships in conversations are difficult, while token-level annotations, \eg, entities, slots and templates, are much easier to obtain. Other sentence embedding methods are usually sentence-level self-supervised frameworks and cannot utilize token-level extra knowledge. We introduce Template-aware Dialogue Sentence Embedding (TaDSE), a novel augmentation method that utilizes template information to learn utterance embeddings via self-supervised contrastive learning framework. We further enhance the effect with a synthetically augmented dataset that diversifies utterance-template association, in which slot-filling is a preliminary step. We evaluate TaDSE performance on five downstream benchmark dialogue datasets. The experiment results show that TaDSE achieves significant improvements over previous SOTA methods for dialogue. We further introduce a novel analytic instrument of semantic compression test, for which we discover a correlation with uniformity and alignment. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Multilingual DistilWhisper: Efficient Distillation of Multi-task Speech Models via Language-Specific Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whisper is a multitask and multilingual speech model covering 99 languages. It yields commendable automatic speech recognition (ASR) results in a subset of its covered languages, but the model still underperforms on a non-negligible number of under-represented languages, a problem exacerbated in smaller model versions. In this work, we propose DistilWhisper, an approach able to bridge the performance gap in ASR for these languages while retaining the advantages of multitask and multilingual capabilities. Our approach involves two key strategies: lightweight modular ASR fine-tuning of whisper-small using language-specific experts, and knowledge distillation from whisper-large-v2. This dual approach allows us to effectively boost ASR performance while keeping the robustness inherited from the multitask and multilingual pre-training. Results demonstrate that our approach is more effective than standard fine-tuning or LoRA adapters, boosting performance in the targeted languages for both in- and out-of-domain test sets, while introducing only a negligible parameter overhead at inference.</description>

      <title>Extending Multilingual Machine Translation through Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing variety of languages supported by existing multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models, most of the world's languages are still being left behind. We aim to extend large-scale MNMT models to incorporate a new language, enabling translations between this new language and all previously supported languages, even in the challenging scenario where only a parallel corpus between the new language and English is available. Previous methods, such as continued training on parallel data including the new language, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which degrades performance on other languages. We propose a novel approach Imit-MNMT which treats this task as an imitation learning problem, a technique widely used in computer vision but less explored in natural language processing. Specifically, we leverage an expert model to generate pseudo-parallel corpora between the new language and the existing languages. We then introduce a data distribution imitation strategy using language-specific weighting, alongside a translation behavior imitation mechanism. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves translation performance between the new and existing languages while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Reliable Reasoning Beyond Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their linguistic competence, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to reason reliably and flexibly. To identify these shortcomings, we introduce the Non-Linear Reasoning (NLR) dataset, a collection of 55 unique, hand-designed problems that target reasoning bottlenecks arising from the sequential prediction paradigm of LLMs and the inherently linear nature of natural language. NLR tasks require iterative updates, backtracking, and reasoning across multiple parallel chains of thought but only basic arithmetic to solve. To address these limitations, we propose a neurosymbolic reasoning approach that integrates Prolog, a symbolic reasoning engine, into the inference pipeline of LLMs. This division of labor shifts the LLM's task from iterative computations to inferring all information, explicit or implied through common sense, and encoding it as logical code. Our method yields large and robust performance gains across the GSM8k and BIG-bench Navigate benchmarks and achieves near-perfect accuracy on NLR problems, maintaining robustness even as variable interdependence - the number of other variables on which the value of a single variable depends - increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant interest, yet the evaluation of multiple models in real-world scenarios remains rare. Multilingual evaluation often relies on translated benchmarks, which typically do not capture linguistic and cultural nuances present in the source language. This study provides an extensive assessment of 24 LLMs on real world data collected from Indian patients interacting with a medical chatbot in Indian English and 4 other Indic languages. We employ a uniform Retrieval Augmented Generation framework to generate responses, which are evaluated using both automated techniques and human evaluators on four specific metrics relevant to our application. We find that models vary significantly in their performance and that instruction tuned Indic models do not always perform well on Indic language queries. Further, we empirically show that factual correctness is generally lower for responses to Indic queries compared to English queries. Finally, our qualitative work shows that code-mixed and culturally relevant queries in our dataset pose challenges to evaluated models.</description>

      <title>NeKo: Cross-Modality Post-Recognition Error Correction with Tasks-Guided Mixture-of-Experts Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction of a general-purpose post-recognition error corrector poses a crucial question: how can we most effectively train a model on a large mixture of domain datasets? The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark. NeKo performs competitively on grammar and post-OCR correction as a multi-task model.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified dataset for document Question-Answering (QA), which is obtained combining several public datasets related to Document AI and visually rich document understanding (VRDU). Our main contribution is twofold: on the one hand we reformulate existing Document AI tasks, such as Information Extraction (IE), into a Question-Answering task, making it a suitable resource for training and evaluating Large Language Models; on the other hand, we release the OCR of all the documents and include the exact position of the answer to be found in the document image as a bounding box. Using this dataset, we explore the impact of different prompting techniques (that might include bounding box information) on the performance of open-weight models, identifying the most effective approaches for document comprehension.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Human Simulations Have Not Yet Been Reliable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for simulating human behaviors across diverse domains. However, our position is that current LLM-based human simulations remain insufficiently reliable, as evidenced by significant discrepancies between their outcomes and authentic human actions. Our investigation begins with a systematic review of LLM-based human simulations in social, economic, policy, and psychological contexts, identifying their common frameworks, recent advances, and persistent limitations. This review reveals that such discrepancies primarily stem from inherent limitations of LLMs and flaws in simulation design, both of which are examined in detail. Building on these insights, we propose a systematic solution framework that emphasizes enriching data foundations, advancing LLM capabilities, and ensuring robust simulation design to enhance reliability. Finally, we introduce a structured algorithm that operationalizes the proposed framework, aiming to guide credible and human-aligned LLM-based simulations. To facilitate further research, we provide a curated list of related literature and resources at https://github.com/Persdre/awesome-llm-human-simulation.</description>

      <title>Generating Text from Uniform Meaning Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) is a recently developed graph-based semantic representation, which expands on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) in a number of ways, in particular through the inclusion of document-level information and multilingual flexibility. In order to effectively adopt and leverage UMR for downstream tasks, efforts must be placed toward developing a UMR technological ecosystem. Though only a small amount of UMR annotations have been produced to date, in this work, we investigate the first approaches to producing text from multilingual UMR graphs. Exploiting the structural similarity between UMR and AMR graphs and the wide availability of AMR technologies, we introduce (1) a baseline approach which passes UMR graphs to AMR-to-text generation models, (2) a pipeline conversion of UMR to AMR, then using AMR-to-text generation models, and (3) a fine-tuning approach for both foundation models and AMR-to-text generation models with UMR data. Our best performing models achieve multilingual BERTscores of 0.825 for English and 0.882 for Chinese, a promising indication of the effectiveness of fine-tuning approaches for UMR-to-text generation even with limited UMR data.</description>

      <title>Med-gte-hybrid: A contextual embedding transformer model for extracting actionable information from clinical texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel contextual embedding model med-gte-hybrid that was derived from the gte-large sentence transformer to extract information from unstructured clinical narratives. Our model tuning strategy for med-gte-hybrid combines contrastive learning and a denoising autoencoder. To evaluate the performance of med-gte-hybrid, we investigate several clinical prediction tasks in large patient cohorts extracted from the MIMIC-IV dataset, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patient prognosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) prediction, and patient mortality prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the med-gte-hybrid model improves patient stratification, clustering, and text retrieval, thus outperforms current state-of-the-art models on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). While some of our evaluations focus on CKD, our hybrid tuning of sentence transformers could be transferred to other medical domains and has the potential to improve clinical decision-making and personalised treatment pathways in various healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>MimeQA: Towards Socially-Intelligent Nonverbal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities, socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing ~8 hours of videos clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (VideoLLMs) and find that they achieve low accuracy, generally ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%. Our analysis reveals that VideoLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG), which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Method for Handling Negative Similarities in Explainable Graph Spectral Clustering of Text Documents -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Graph Spectral Clustering with negative similarities, resulting from document embeddings different from the traditional Term Vector Space (like doc2vec, GloVe, etc.). Solutions for combinatorial Laplacians and normalized Laplacians are discussed. An experimental investigation shows the advantages and disadvantages of 6 different solutions proposed in the literature and in this research. The research demonstrates that GloVe embeddings frequently cause failures of normalized Laplacian based GSC due to negative similarities. Furthermore, application of methods curing similarity negativity leads to accuracy improvement for both combinatorial and normalized Laplacian based GSC. It also leads to applicability for GloVe embeddings of explanation methods developed originally bythe authors for Term Vector Space embeddings.</description>

      <title>Nemotron-CLIMB: CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping for Language Model Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-training datasets are typically collected from web content and lack inherent domain divisions. For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges, we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (Nemotron-CLIMB), an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pre-training setting. Specifically, Nemotron-CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling. Finally, we introduce Nemotron-ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20 clusters as a research playground, and Nemotron-ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful 400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data is available at: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/climb/</description>

      <title>Do different prompting methods yield a common task representation in language models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demonstrations and instructions are two primary approaches for prompting language models to perform in-context learning (ICL) tasks. Do identical tasks elicited in different ways result in similar representations of the task? An improved understanding of task representation mechanisms would offer interpretability insights and may aid in steering models. We study this through \textit{function vectors} (FVs), recently proposed as a mechanism to extract few-shot ICL task representations. We generalize FVs to alternative task presentations, focusing on short textual instruction prompts, and successfully extract instruction function vectors that promote zero-shot task accuracy. We find evidence that demonstration- and instruction-based function vectors leverage different model components, and offer several controls to dissociate their contributions to task performance. Our results suggest that different task promptings forms do not induce a common task representation through FVs but elicit different, partly overlapping mechanisms. Our findings offer principled support to the practice of combining instructions and task demonstrations, imply challenges in universally monitoring task inference across presentation forms, and encourage further examinations of LLM task inference mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Extracting memorized pieces of (copyrighted) books from open-weight language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plaintiffs and defendants in copyright lawsuits over generative AI often make sweeping, opposing claims about the extent to which large language models (LLMs) have memorized plaintiffs' protected expression in their training data. Drawing on both machine learning and copyright law, we show that these polarized positions dramatically oversimplify the relationship between memorization and copyright. To do so, we extend a recent probabilistic extraction technique to measure memorization of 50 books in 17 open-weight LLMs. Through thousands of experiments, we show that the extent of memorization varies both by model and by book. With respect to our specific extraction methodology, we find that most LLMs do not memorize most books -- either in whole or in part. However, we also find that Llama 3.1 70B entirely memorizes some books, like the first Harry Potter book and 1984. In fact, the first Harry Potter is so memorized that, using a seed prompt consisting of just the first few tokens of the first chapter, we can deterministically generate the entire book near-verbatim. We discuss why our results have significant implications for copyright cases, though not ones that unambiguously favor either side.</description>

      <title>A Token is Worth over 1,000 Tokens: Efficient Knowledge Distillation through Low-Rank Clone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training high-performing Small Language Models (SLMs) remains costly, even with knowledge distillation and pruning from larger teacher models. Existing work often faces three key challenges: (1) information loss from hard pruning, (2) inefficient alignment of representations, and (3) underutilization of informative activations, particularly from Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). To address these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient pre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence with strong teacher models. LRC trains a set of low-rank projection matrices that jointly enable soft pruning by compressing teacher weights, and activation clone by aligning student activations, including FFN signals, with those of the teacher. This unified design maximizes knowledge transfer while removing the need for explicit alignment modules. Extensive experiments with open-source teachers (e.g., Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-3B/7B-Instruct) show that LRC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art models trained on trillions of tokens--while using only 20B tokens, achieving over 1,000x training efficiency. Our codes and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/LowRankClone and https://huggingface.co/collections/JitaiHao/low-rank-clone-lrc-6828389e96a93f1d4219dfaf.</description>

      <title>Attributional Safety Failures in Large Language Models under Code-Mixed Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While LLMs appear robustly safety-aligned in English, we uncover a catastrophic, overlooked weakness: attributional collapse under code-mixed perturbations. Our systematic evaluation of open models shows that the linguistic camouflage of code-mixing -- ``blending languages within a single conversation'' -- can cause safety guardrails to fail dramatically. Attack success rates (ASR) spike from a benign 9\% in monolingual English to 69\% under code-mixed inputs, with rates exceeding 90\% in non-Western contexts such as Arabic and Hindi. These effects hold not only on controlled synthetic datasets but also on real-world social media traces, revealing a serious risk for billions of users. To explain why this happens, we introduce saliency drift attribution (SDA), an interpretability framework that shows how, under code-mixing, the model's internal attention drifts away from safety-critical tokens (e.g., ``violence'' or ``corruption''), effectively blinding it to harmful intent. Finally, we propose a lightweight translation-based restoration strategy that recovers roughly 80\% of the safety lost to code-mixing, offering a practical path toward more equitable and robust LLM safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due to pitch-accent sensitivity and stylistic variability. This paper empirically evaluates two open-source text-to-speech models--VITS and Style-BERT-VITS2 JP Extra (SBV2JE)--on in-domain, character-driven Japanese speech. Using three character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate), and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS. Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue generation, despite higher computational demands.</description>

Abstract: Lexical normalization research has sought to tackle the challenge of processing informal expressions in user-generated text, yet the absence of comprehensive evaluations leaves it unclear which methods excel across multiple perspectives. Focusing on unsegmented languages, we make three key contributions: (1) creating a large-scale, multi-domain Japanese normalization dataset, (2) developing normalization methods based on state-of-the-art pretrained models, and (3) conducting experiments across multiple evaluation perspectives. Our experiments show that both encoder-only and decoder-only approaches achieve promising results in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Eye of Judgement: Dissecting the Evaluation of Russian-speaking LLMs with POLLUX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming, side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100 manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B) evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Guiding Monosemanticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging mechanistic interpretability and controllability to better understand and influence the internal dynamics of large language models (LLMs). However, current methods face fundamental challenges in reliably localizing and manipulating feature representations. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a promising direction for feature extraction at scale, yet they, too, are limited by incomplete feature isolation and unreliable monosemanticity. To systematically quantify these limitations, we introduce Feature Monosemanticity Score (FMS), a novel metric to quantify feature monosemanticity in latent representation. Building on these insights, we propose Guided Sparse Autoencoders (G-SAE), a method that conditions latent representations on labeled concepts during training. We demonstrate that reliable localization and disentanglement of target concepts within the latent space improve interpretability, detection of behavior, and control. Specifically, our evaluations on toxicity detection, writing style identification, and privacy attribute recognition show that G-SAE not only enhances monosemanticity but also enables more effective and fine-grained steering with less quality degradation. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for measuring and advancing mechanistic interpretability and control of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Cognitive Bias Induction in LLM-Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are integrated into applications like shopping reviews, summarization, or medical diagnosis support, where their use affects human decisions. We investigate the extent to which LLMs expose users to biased content and demonstrate its effect on human decision-making. We assess five LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating the consistency of LLMs with their context and their tendency to hallucinate on a new self-updating dataset. Our findings show that LLMs expose users to content that changes the context's sentiment in 26.42% of cases (framing bias), hallucinate on 60.33% of post-knowledge-cutoff questions, and highlight context from earlier parts of the prompt (primacy bias) in 10.12% of cases, averaged across all tested models. We further find that humans are 32% more likely to purchase the same product after reading a summary of the review generated by an LLM rather than the original review. To address these issues, we evaluate 18 mitigation methods across three LLM families and find the effectiveness of targeted interventions.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Verbal Confidence of LLMs in Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for the deployment of LLMs to help ensure transparency, trust, and safety in many applications, including those involving human-AI interactions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence under adversarial attacks. We introduce attack frameworks targeting verbal confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and demonstrate that these attacks can significantly impair verbal confidence estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that current verbal confidence is vulnerable and that commonly used defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings underscore the need to design robust mechanisms for confidence expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead to misleading confidence in responses.</description>

      <title>Confident RAG: Enhancing the Performance of LLMs for Mathematics Question Answering through Multi-Embedding and Confidence Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for mathematics education, yet they often struggle with complex mathematical reasoning. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs in external knowledge, its effectiveness remains unstable, heavily dependent on the choice of a single embedding model. Moving beyond static RAG workflows, we draw on agentic workflow patterns, a paradigm that introduces structured task decomposition and collaboration to enhance system performance. We propose and examine two novel approaches that combine the benefits of multiple embedding models. While our Mixture-Embedding RAG approach (fusing retrieved documents) shows limited gains, our Confident RAG method (generating multiple answers and selecting the one with the highest confidence score) demonstrates significant improvement. Experimental results show that Confident RAG achieved average accuracy improvements of approximately 10% over vanilla LLMs and 5% over vanilla RAG. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play solution for trustworthy mathematical AI assistants. Finally, we discuss how this work lays the groundwork for deploying Agentic RAG systems in educational settings, where autonomous planning and iterative refinement can be built upon our robust retrieval foundation.</description>

      <title>Checklists Are Better Than Reward Models For Aligning Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions. Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF). From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs - then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a 3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that express a multitude of needs.</description>

      <title>Debating Truth: Debate-driven Claim Verification with Multiple Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Claim verification is essential for digital literacy, yet state-of-the-art single-agent methods often struggle with complex claims that require nuanced analysis of multifaceted online evidence. Inspired by real-world human fact-checking practices, we propose \textbf{DebateCV}, the first debate-driven claim verification framework powered by multiple LLM agents. In DebateCV, two \textit{Debaters} argue opposing stances over multiple rounds to surface subtle errors in single-agent assessments. A decisive \textit{Moderator} is then required to weigh the evidential strength of conflicting arguments to deliver an accurate verdict. Yet zero-shot agents struggle to adjudicate multi-round debates for verifying complex claims, often defaulting to neutral judgements, and no datasets exist for training agents for this role. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Debate-SFT}, a post-training framework that leverages synthetic data to enhance agents' ability to effectively adjudicate debates for claim verification. Results show that our methods surpass state-of-the-art non-debate approaches in both accuracy (across various evidence conditions) and justification quality, which strengthens societal resilience against misinformation and contributes to a more trustworthy online information ecosystem.</description>

      <title>SpeechIQ: Speech-Agentic Intelligence Quotient Across Cognitive Levels in Voice Understanding by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</description>

      <title>SpeechRole: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Evaluating Speech Role-Playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing. Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing research and to foster further developments in this field.</description>

      <title>ShoppingBench: A Real-World Intent-Grounded Shopping Benchmark for LLM-based Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks, highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.</description>

      <title>Persistent Instability in LLM's Personality Measurements: Effects of Scale, Reasoning, and Conversation History</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe deployment, yet there are indications of large variability that may lead to an instable expression of personality traits in these models. We present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive evaluation framework testing 25 open-source models (1B-685B parameters) across 2 million+ responses. Using traditional (BFI, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted personality questionnaires, we systematically vary model size, personas, reasoning modes, question order or paraphrasing, and conversation history. Our findings challenge fundamental assumptions: (1) Question reordering alone can introduce large shifts in personality measurements; (2) Scaling provides limited stability gains: even 400B+ models exhibit standard deviations &gt;0.3 on 5-point scales; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as reasoning and inclusion of conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) Detailed persona instructions produce mixed effects, with misaligned personas showing significantly higher variability than the helpful assistant baseline; (5) The LLM-adapted questionnaires, despite their improved ecological validity, exhibit instability comparable to human-centric versions. This persistent instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests that current LLMs lack the architectural foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that current alignment strategies may be inadequate.</description>

      <title>CCFQA: A Benchmark for Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Speech and Text Factuality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly popularized in the multilingual world, ensuring hallucination-free factuality becomes markedly crucial. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly focus on textual or visual modalities with a primary emphasis on English, which creates a gap in evaluation when processing multilingual input, especially in speech. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Factuality benchmark (CCFQA). Specifically, the CCFQA benchmark contains parallel speech-text factual questions across 8 languages, designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' cross-lingual and cross-modal factuality capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that current MLLMs still face substantial challenges on the CCFQA benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a few-shot transfer learning strategy that effectively transfers the Question Answering (QA) capabilities of LLMs in English to multilingual Spoken Question Answering (SQA) tasks, achieving competitive performance with GPT-4o-mini-Audio using just 5-shot training. We release CCFQA as a foundational research resource to promote the development of MLLMs with more robust and reliable speech understanding capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/yxduir/ccfqa.</description>

      <title>DESIGNER: Design-Logic-Guided Multidisciplinary Data Synthesis for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often lack disciplinary breadth, reasoning depth, and diversity, as well as guiding principles for question synthesis. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive raw documents (e.g., book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary challenging questions. We introduce the concept of "design logic" and instruct LLMs to mimic human educators' question-creation process, enabling the automated synthesis of large-scale, high-difficulty questions. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these design logics with source documents, we are able to generate reasoning questions with controllable question types and difficulty levels. Using this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning datasets that span 75 disciplines: DLR-Book (3.04 million questions from the book corpus) and DLR-Web (1.66 million questions from the web corpus). Data analysis indicates that the questions synthesized by our method exhibit greater difficulty and diversity compared to those in the baseline datasets. We validate our synthesized data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the Qwen3 and Llama3 model families. Our data substantially enhances their multidisciplinary reasoning capabilities, outperforming existing datasets. Notably, by applying SFT on the base versions of these models using only our data, we even surpass their official final models that have undergone the full post-training process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Extensive experiments across four models and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that CoQ achieves substantial accuracy improvements and significantly lowers invalid SQL rates compared to prior generic LLM-based, SQL-aided, and hybrid baselines, confirming its superior effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/ChainofQuery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e., deducing subtle numerical scores from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g., for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems such as rubric-based scoring, modeling dense rewards in complex environments, or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of context is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast four realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.</description>

      <title>Explainable Semantic Text Relations: A Question-Answering Framework for Comparing Document Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding semantic relations between two texts is crucial for many information and document management tasks, in which one must determine whether the content fully overlaps, is completely superseded by another document, or overlaps only partially, with unique information in each. Beyond establishing this relation, it is equally important to provide explainable outputs that specify which pieces of information are present, missing, or newly added between the text pair. In this study, we formally define semantic relations between two texts through the set-theoretic relation between their respective Answerable Question Sets (AQS), the sets of questions each text can answer. Under this formulation, Semantic Text Relation (STR), such as equivalence, inclusion, and mutual overlap, becomes a well-defined set relation between the corresponding texts' AQSs. The set differences between the AQSs also serve as an explanation or diagnostic tool for identifying how the information in the texts diverges. Using this definition, we construct a synthetic benchmark that captures fine-grained informational relations through controlled paraphrasing and deliberate information removal supported by AQS manipulations. We then use this dataset to evaluate several discriminative and generative models for classifying text pairs into STR categories, assessing how well different model architectures capture semantic relations beyond surface-level similarity. We publicly release both the dataset and the data generation code to support further research.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Language Formalization to First Order Logic with Fine-tuned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training, introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Beyond Token Length: Step Pruner for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks but often suffer from excessive verbosity, known as "overthinking." Existing solutions via reinforcement learning (RL) typically penalize generated tokens to promote conciseness. However, these methods encounter two challenges: responses with fewer tokens do not always correspond to fewer reasoning steps, and models may develop hacking behavior in later stages of training by discarding reasoning steps to minimize token usage. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Step Pruner (SP)}, an RL framework that steers LRMs toward more efficient reasoning by favoring compact reasoning steps. Our step-aware reward function prioritizes correctness while imposing penalties for redundant steps, and withholds rewards for incorrect responses to prevent the reinforcement of erroneous reasoning. Moreover, we propose a dynamic stopping mechanism: when the model's output no longer shortens, training is halted to prevent hacking behavior caused by the merging of steps. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing response length. For instance, on AIME24, SP reduces token usage by \textbf{69.7\%}.</description>

      <title>SECA: Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks for Eliciting LLM Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains. However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring almost no semantic equivalence or semantic coherence errors compared to existing methods. SECA highlights the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs to realistic and plausible prompt variations.

      <description>arXiv:2510.06249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2025 Multimodal Models for Low-Resource Contexts and Social Impact (MMLoSo) Language Challenge addresses one of India's most pressing linguistic gaps: the lack of resources for its diverse low-resource languages (LRLs). In this study, we investigate whether enforcing cross-lingual similarity in specific internal layers of a decoder-only multilingual large language model (LLM) can improve translation quality from LRL to high-resource language (HRL). Specifically, we combine Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), a similarity metric that encourages representations of different languages to align, with REPINA, a regularization method that constrains parameter updates to remain close to the pretrained model, into a joint method we call TRepLiNa. In this research project, we experiment with zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings using Aya-23 8B with QLoRA across MMLoSo shared task language pairs (Mundari, Santali, Bhili) with Hindi/English pivots. Our results show that aligning mid-level layers using TRepLiNa (CKA+REPINA) is a low-cost, practical approach to improving LRL translation, especially in data-scarce settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area. We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas -- including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.</description>

      <title>Closing the Data-Efficiency Gap Between Autoregressive and Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current dominant paradigm in language modeling, effectively updating these models to incorporate new factual knowledge still remains difficult. They resist knowledge injection via fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training. However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs, evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal gains. Inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing its performance gap with dLLMs. We further show that the masked fine-tuning paradigm of arLLMs can be extended to the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of mathematical capability. Across two models and two datasets, our masked SFT outperforms regular SFT.</description>

      <title>DND: Boosting Large Language Models with Dynamic Nested Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer, DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by 0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.</description>

      <title>Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has argued that recursive numeral systems optimise the trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems optimise this tradeoff has proven elusive, and the existing solution has relied on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025). Here, we argue that this issue arises because the proposed trade-off has neglected regularity, a crucial aspect of complexity central to human grammars in general. Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we propose that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the key differences between attested, natural systems and unattested but possible ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and that the ad-hoc constraints from previous literature naturally follow from regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across sets of forms in studies that attempt to measure and explain optimality in language.</description>

      <title>Prompt-R1: Collaborative Automatic Prompting Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QwenQKing/Prompt-R1.</description>

      <title>EQ-Negotiator: Dynamic Emotional Personas Empower Small Language Models for Edge-Deployable Credit Negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.</description>

      <title>DPRM: A Dual Implicit Process Reward Model in Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-hop question answering (MHQA) tasks, Chain of Thought (CoT) improves the quality of generation by guiding large language models (LLMs) through multi-step reasoning, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) reduce hallucinations via semantic matching. Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1.</description>

      <title>Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation. The results establish GAD as a promising and effective paradigm for black-box LLM distillation.</description>

      <title>Spark-Prover-X1: Formal Theorem Proving Through Diverse Data Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in automated theorem proving, yet progress is often constrained by the scarcity of diverse and high-quality formal language data. To address this issue, we introduce Spark-Prover-X1, a 7B parameter model trained via an three-stage framework designed to unlock the reasoning potential of more accessible and moderately-sized LLMs. The first stage infuses deep knowledge through continuous pre-training on a broad mathematical corpus, enhanced by a suite of novel data tasks. Key innovation is a "CoT-augmented state prediction" task to achieve fine-grained reasoning. The second stage employs Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) within an expert iteration loop to specialize both the Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B models. Finally, a targeted round of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is applied to sharpen the prover's capabilities on the most challenging problems. To facilitate robust evaluation, particularly on problems from real-world examinations, we also introduce ExamFormal-Bench, a new benchmark dataset of 402 formal problems. Experimental results demonstrate that Spark-Prover achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly-sized open-source models within the "Whole-Proof Generation" paradigm. It shows exceptional performance on difficult competition benchmarks, notably solving 27 problems on PutnamBench (pass@32) and achieving 24.0\% on CombiBench (pass@32). Our work validates that this diverse training data and progressively refined training pipeline provides an effective path for enhancing the formal reasoning capabilities of lightweight LLMs. We will release both Spark-Prover-X1-7B and Spark-Formalizer-X1-7B, along with the ExamFormal-Bench dataset, in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect statements despite having access to relevant evidence, a failure mode rooted in how they allocate attention between contextual and parametric knowledge. Understanding and steering this internal behavior is key both for trustworthy deployment and for scientific interpretability of model mechanisms. We introduce COMPASS (Context-Modulated PID Attention Steering System), a lightweight, interpretable control framework that embeds a model-based feedback loop directly within decoding. COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding. Across benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates (2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute) while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment. These results highlight feedback-driven interpretability as a pathway toward scientific understanding of LLM behavior.</description>

      <title>PEPPER: Perception-Guided Perturbation for Robust Backdoor Defense in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies show that text to image (T2I) diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a trigger in the input prompt can steer generation toward harmful or unintended content. To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality. Beyond this, PEPPER can be paired with any existing defenses yielding consistently stronger and generalizable robustness than any standalone method. Our code will be released on Github.</description>

      <title>PARROT: Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth -- A Sycophancy Robustness Benchmark for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents PARROT (Persuasion and Agreement Robustness Rating of Output Truth), a robustness focused framework designed to measure the degradation in accuracy that occurs under social pressure exerted on users through authority and persuasion in large language models (LLMs) the phenomenon of sycophancy (excessive conformity). PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low "follow rates" ($\leq 11\%$, GPT-5: 4\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of "resistance to overfitting pressure" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models on the 2026 Korean CSAT Mathematics Exam: Measuring Mathematical Ability in a Zero-Data-Leakage Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically evaluated the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) Mathematics section, ensuring a completely contamination-free evaluation environment. To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (Text-only, Image-only, Text+Figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English). The GPT-5 family models achieved perfect scores (100 points) under a limited set of language-modality configurations, while Grok 4, Qwen 3 235B, and Gemini 2.5 pro also scored above 97 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed Calculus as the weakest domain with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale. In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (82.6-&gt;100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a standardized digitization pipeline that converts human-targeted exam materials into LLM-ready evaluation data, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations. Detailed results and model comparisons are available at the 2026 Korean CSAT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard; https://isoft.cnu.ac.kr/csat2026/</description>

      <title>Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Distribution-Based Feature Recovery and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Mental Health Conditions and Cyberbullying from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Confusion Attack: Disrupting Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Practical applications include embedding such adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered AI Agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and Adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</description>

      <title>Efficient LLM-Jailbreaking via Multimodal-LLM Jailbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against large language models (LLMs), eliciting them to generate objectionable content in response to harmful user queries. Unlike previous LLM-jailbreak methods that directly orient to LLMs, our approach begins by constructing a multimodal large language model (MLLM) built upon the target LLM. Subsequently, we perform an efficient MLLM jailbreak and obtain a jailbreaking embedding. Finally, we convert the embedding into a textual jailbreaking suffix to carry out the jailbreak of target LLM. Compared to the direct LLM-jailbreak methods, our indirect jailbreaking approach is more efficient, as MLLMs are more vulnerable to jailbreak than pure LLM. Additionally, to improve the attack success rate of jailbreak, we propose an image-text semantic matching scheme to identify a suitable initial input. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art jailbreak methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior cross-class generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>GermanPartiesQA: Benchmarking Commercial Large Language Models and AI Companions for Political Alignment and Sycophancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping citizens' information ecosystems. Products incorporating LLMs, such as chatbots and AI Companions, are now widely used for decision support and information retrieval, including in sensitive domains, raising concerns about hidden biases and growing potential to shape individual decisions and public opinion. This paper introduces GermanPartiesQA, a benchmark of 418 political statements from German Voting Advice Applications across 11 elections to evaluate six commercial LLMs. We evaluate their political alignment based on role-playing experiments with political personas. Our evaluation reveals three specific findings: (1) Factual limitations: LLMs show limited ability to accurately generate factual party positions, particularly for centrist parties. (2) Model-specific ideological alignment: We identify consistent alignment patterns and the degree of political steerability for each model across temperature settings and experiments. (3) Claim of sycophancy: While models adjust to political personas during role-play, we find this reflects persona-based steerability rather than the increasingly popular, yet contested concept of sycophancy. Our study contributes to evaluating the political alignment of closed-source LLMs that are increasingly embedded in electoral decision support tools and AI Companion chatbots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02429v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models excel in textual tasks but often struggle with physical-world reasoning tasks. Inspired by human cognition, where perception is fundamental to reasoning, we explore augmenting LLMs with enhanced perception abilities using Internet of Things (IoT) data and pertinent knowledge. In this work, we systematically study LLMs' capability to address IoT-sensory tasks by augmenting their perception and knowledge base, and then propose a unified framework, IoT-LLM, to enhance such capability. In IoT-LLM, we customize three steps: preprocessing IoT data into suitable formats, expanding LLMs knowledge via IoT-oriented retrieval-augmented generation and activating LLMs commonsense knowledge through chain-of-thought prompting. We design a benchmark comprising five real-world tasks with varying data types and reasoning complexities to evaluate the performance of IoT-LLM. Experimental results reveal that IoT-LLM significantly improves the performance of IoT-sensory task reasoning of LLMs, with models like GPT-4o-mini showing a 49.4% average improvement over previous methods.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Performance of Black-box LLMs through Follow-up Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01558v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably predicting the behavior of language models -- such as whether their outputs are correct or have been adversarially manipulated -- is a fundamentally challenging task. This is often made even more difficult as frontier language models are offered only through closed-source APIs, providing only black-box access. In this paper, we predict the behavior of black-box language models by asking follow-up questions and taking the probabilities of responses \emph{as} representations to train reliable predictors. We first demonstrate that training a linear model on these responses reliably and accurately predicts model correctness on question-answering and reasoning benchmarks. Surprisingly, this can \textit{even outperform white-box linear predictors} that operate over model internals or activations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these follow-up question responses can reliably distinguish between a clean version of an LLM and one that has been adversarially influenced via a system prompt to answer questions incorrectly or to introduce bugs into generated code. Finally, we show that they can also be used to differentiate between black-box LLMs, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API. Overall, our work shows promise in monitoring black-box language model behavior, supporting their deployment in larger, autonomous systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose $\texttt{CTRL}$, a framework for $\texttt{C}$ritic $\texttt{T}$raining via $\texttt{R}$einforcement $\texttt{L}$earning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with $\texttt{CTRL}$ significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Life-Code: Central Dogma Modeling with Multi-Omics Sequence Unification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Human Decision-making is Susceptible to AI-driven Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems are increasingly intertwined with daily life, assisting users with various tasks and guiding decision-making. This integration introduces risks of AI-driven manipulation, where such systems may exploit users' cognitive biases and emotional vulnerabilities to steer them toward harmful outcomes. Through a randomized between-subjects experiment with 233 participants, we examined human susceptibility to such manipulation in financial (e.g., purchases) and emotional (e.g., conflict resolution) decision-making contexts. Participants interacted with one of three AI agents: a neutral agent (NA) optimizing for user benefit without explicit influence, a manipulative agent (MA) designed to covertly influence beliefs and behaviors, or a strategy-enhanced manipulative agent (SEMA) equipped with established psychological tactics, allowing it to select and apply them adaptively during interactions to reach its hidden objectives. By analyzing participants' preference ratings, we found significant susceptibility to AI-driven manipulation. Particularly across both decision-making domains, interacting with the manipulative agents significantly increased the odds of rating hidden incentives higher than optimal options (Financial, MA: OR=5.24, SEMA: OR=7.96; Emotional, MA: OR=5.52, SEMA: OR=5.71) compared to the NA group. Notably, we found no clear evidence that employing psychological strategies (SEMA) was overall more effective than simple manipulative objectives (MA) on our primary outcomes. Hence, AI-driven manipulation could become widespread even without requiring sophisticated tactics and expertise. While our findings are preliminary and derived from hypothetical, low-stakes scenarios, we highlight a critical vulnerability in human-AI interactions, emphasizing the need for ethical safeguards and regulatory frameworks to protect human autonomy.</description>

      <title>Escaping Collapse: The Strength of Weak Data for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetically-generated data plays an increasingly larger role in training large language models. However, while synthetic data has been found to be useful, studies have also shown that without proper curation it can cause LLM performance to plateau, or even "collapse", after many training iterations. In this paper, we formalize this question and develop a theoretical framework to investigate how much curation is needed in order to ensure that LLM performance continually improves. Our analysis is inspired by boosting, a classic machine learning technique that leverages a very weak learning algorithm to produce an arbitrarily good classifier. The approach we analyze subsumes many recently proposed methods for training LLMs on synthetic data, and thus our analysis sheds light on why they are successful, and also suggests opportunities for future improvement. We present experiments that validate our theory, and show that dynamically focusing labeling resources on the most challenging examples -- in much the same way that boosting focuses the efforts of the weak learner -- leads to improved performance.</description>

      <title>SWE-RL: Advancing LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning on Open Software Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent DeepSeek-R1 release has demonstrated the immense potential of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While DeepSeek-R1 and other follow-up work primarily focus on applying RL to competitive coding and math problems, this paper introduces SWE-RL, the first approach to scale RL-based LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering. Leveraging a lightweight rule-based reward (e.g., the similarity score between ground-truth and LLM-generated solutions), SWE-RL enables LLMs to autonomously recover a developer's reasoning processes and solutions by learning from extensive open-source software evolution data -- the record of a software's entire lifecycle, including its code snapshots, code changes, and events such as issues and pull requests. Trained on top of Llama 3, our resulting reasoning model, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B, achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified -- a human-verified collection of real-world GitHub issues. To our knowledge, this is the best performance reported for medium-sized (&lt;100B) LLMs to date, even comparable to leading proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o. Surprisingly, despite performing RL solely on software evolution data, Llama3-SWE-RL has even emerged with generalized reasoning skills. For example, it shows improved results on five out-of-domain tasks, namely, function coding, library use, code reasoning, mathematics, and general language understanding, whereas a supervised-finetuning baseline even leads to performance degradation on average. Overall, SWE-RL opens up a new direction to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through reinforcement learning on massive software engineering data.</description>

      <title>Prompt-OT: An Optimal Transport Regularization Paradigm for Knowledge Preservation in Vision-Language Model Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

      <title>A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12899v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce erroneous code. Rather than repairing outputs, a more thorough remedy is to address underlying model failures. LM repair offers a lightweight solution: it requires minimal data, lowers computational cost, and limits side effects. Unlike full retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it suitable for limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose Semantic Targeting for Analytical Repair (STAR), a novel semantic-based optimization method for repairing LLMs. STAR realizes the main operations of repairing LMs in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (MINT) and standard optimization methods (SGD), STAR integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. By reformulating LM repair as an optimization process, STAR may solve multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on coding tasks using popular code LMs, STAR demonstrates superior effectiveness compared with the state-of-the-art. Besides, STAR exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, STAR outperforms prior work by a significant margin. Additionally, we conducted assessments on the overfitting risk of LM repair as well as the cumulative impact. Further, we analyzed the differences with pipeline-based methods and explained the reason why STAR is better and how it mitigated the common limitations of LM repair.</description>

      <title>RealWebAssist: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Web Assistance with Real-World Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To achieve successful assistance with long-horizon web-based tasks, AI agents must be able to sequentially follow real-world user instructions over a long period. Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.</description>

      <title>Superposition Yields Robust Neural Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling inversely with model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down.</description>

      <title>InvisibleInk: High-Utility and Low-Cost Text Generation with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to the sensitive reference texts. It interprets sampling from the LLM's next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling without any privacy cost from a small superset of the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent $8\times$ (or more) reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. InvisibleInk is able to generate, for the first time, high-quality private long-form text at less than $4$-$8\times$ times the computation cost of non-private generation, paving the way for its practical use. We open-source a pip-installable Python package (invink) for InvisibleInk at https://github.com/cerai-iitm/invisibleink.</description>

      <title>MERA Code: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Code Generation Across Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering; however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks, overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.</description>

      <title>SpikingBrain: Spiking Brain-inspired Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms, and training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX GPUs with Model FLOPs Utilization at expected levels. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models also significantly improve long-context efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Furthermore, the proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.</description>

      <title>Event2Vec: A Geometric Approach to Learning Composable Representations of Event Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis. Quantitative evaluation on the Brown Corpus yields a Silhouette score of 0.0564, outperforming a Word2Vec baseline (0.0215), demonstrating the model's ability to capture structural dependencies without supervision.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Margin RLHF via Preference over Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.</description>

Abstract: We present an extended version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX-v1-extended), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier models are capable of performing economically valuable tasks in four jobs: investment banking associate, management consultant, big law associate, and primary care physician (MD). This technical report details the extensions to APEX-v1, including an increase in the held-out evaluation set from n = 50 to n = 100 cases per job (n = 400 total) and updates to the grading methodology. We present a new leaderboard, where GPT5 (Thinking = High) remains the top performing model with a score of 67.0%. APEX-v1-extended shows that frontier models still have substantial limitations when performing typical professional tasks. To support further research, we are open sourcing n = 25 non-benchmark example cases per role (n = 100 total) along with our evaluation harness.</description>

      <title>Enhancing OCR for Sino-Vietnamese Language Processing via Fine-tuned PaddleOCRv5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans, non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation, and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent, particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/MinhDS/Fine-tuned-PaddleOCRv5</description>

      <title>Influence Functions for Efficient Data Selection in Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet, what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.</description>

      <title>LLMs can hide text in other text of the same length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present Calgacus, a simple and efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication, already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it means for a Large Language Model to know something.</description>

      <title>Small Drafts, Big Verdict: Information-Intensive Visual Reasoning via Speculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K. By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

      <title>Combining Textual and Structural Information for Premise Selection in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph capturing both state-premise and premise-premise relations. On the LeanDojo Benchmark, our method outperforms the ReProver language-based baseline by over 25\% across standard retrieval metrics. These results suggest that relational information is beneficial for premise selection.</description>

      <title>Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.</description>

      <title>SpeechJudge: Towards Human-Level Judgment for Speech Naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large generative models with human feedback is a critical challenge. In speech synthesis, this is particularly pronounced due to the lack of a large-scale human preference dataset, which hinders the development of models that truly align with human perception. To address this, we introduce SpeechJudge, a comprehensive suite comprising a dataset, a benchmark, and a reward model centered on naturalness--one of the most fundamental subjective metrics for speech synthesis. First, we present SpeechJudge-Data, a large-scale human feedback corpus of 99K speech pairs. The dataset is constructed using a diverse set of advanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models across diverse speech styles and multiple languages, with human annotations for both intelligibility and naturalness preference. From this, we establish SpeechJudge-Eval, a challenging benchmark for speech naturalness judgment. Our evaluation reveals that existing metrics and AudioLLMs struggle with this task; the leading model, Gemini-2.5-Flash, achieves less than 70% agreement with human judgment, highlighting a significant gap for improvement. To bridge this gap, we develop SpeechJudge-GRM, a generative reward model (GRM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B. It is trained on SpeechJudge-Data via a two-stage post-training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought rationales followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) with GRPO on challenging cases. On the SpeechJudge-Eval benchmark, the proposed SpeechJudge-GRM demonstrates superior performance, achieving 77.2% accuracy (and 79.4% after inference-time scaling @10) compared to a classic Bradley-Terry reward model (72.7%). Furthermore, SpeechJudge-GRM can be also employed as a reward function during the post-training of speech generation models to facilitate their alignment with human preferences.</description>

      <title>SRPO: Self-Referential Policy Optimization for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.</description>

      <title>From Code Foundation Models to Agents and Applications: A Practical Guide to Code Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</description>

      <title>Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Does Understanding Inform Generation in Unified Multimodal Models? From Analysis to Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

      <title>From Topology to Retrieval: Decoding Embedding Spaces with Unified Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.</description>
