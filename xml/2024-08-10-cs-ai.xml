      <title>NAVINACT: Combining Navigation and Imitation Learning for Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable progress in simulation environments, yet its application to real-world robotic tasks remains limited due to challenges in exploration and generalisation. To address these issues, we introduce NAVINACT, a framework that chooses when the robot should use classical motion planning-based navigation and when it should learn a policy. To further improve the efficiency in exploration, we use imitation data to bootstrap the exploration. NAVINACT dynamically switches between two modes of operation: navigating to a waypoint using classical techniques when away from the objects and reinforcement learning for fine-grained manipulation control when about to interact with objects. NAVINACT consists of a multi-head architecture composed of ModeNet for mode classification, NavNet for waypoint prediction, and InteractNet for precise manipulation. By combining the strengths of RL and Imitation Learning (IL), NAVINACT improves sample efficiency and mitigates distribution shift, ensuring robust task execution. We evaluate our approach across multiple challenging simulation environments and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior performance in terms of adaptability, efficiency, and generalization compared to existing methods. In both simulated and real-world settings, NAVINACT demonstrates robust performance. In simulations, NAVINACT surpasses baseline methods by 10-15\% in training success rates at 30k samples and by 30-40\% during evaluation phases. In real-world scenarios, it demonstrates a 30-40\% higher success rate on simpler tasks compared to baselines and uniquely succeeds in complex, two-stage manipulation tasks.

      <title>Digital Avatars: Framework Development and Their Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel prompting strategy for artificial intelligence driven digital avatars. To better quantify how our prompting strategy affects anthropomorphic features like humor, authenticity, and favorability we present Crowd Vote - an adaptation of Crowd Score that allows for judges to elect a large language model (LLM) candidate over competitors answering the same or similar prompts. To visualize the responses of our LLM, and the effectiveness of our prompting strategy we propose an end-to-end framework for creating high-fidelity artificial intelligence (AI) driven digital avatars. This pipeline effectively captures an individual's essence for interaction and our streaming algorithm delivers a high-quality digital avatar with real-time audio-video streaming from server to mobile device. Both our visualization tool, and our Crowd Vote metrics demonstrate our AI driven digital avatars have state-of-the-art humor, authenticity, and favorability outperforming all competitors and baselines. In the case of our Donald Trump and Joe Biden avatars, their authenticity and favorability are rated higher than even their real-world equivalents.</description>

      <title>Perceive, Reflect, and Plan: Designing LLM Agent for Goal-Directed City Navigation without Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a scenario in city navigation: an AI agent is provided with language descriptions of the goal location with respect to some well-known landmarks; By only observing the scene around, including recognizing landmarks and road network connections, the agent has to make decisions to navigate to the goal location without instructions. This problem is very challenging, because it requires agent to establish self-position and acquire spatial representation of complex urban environment, where landmarks are often invisible. In the absence of navigation instructions, such abilities are vital for the agent to make high-quality decisions in long-range city navigation. With the emergent reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), a tempting baseline is to prompt LLMs to "react" on each observation and make decisions accordingly. However, this baseline has very poor performance that the agent often repeatedly visits same locations and make short-sighted, inconsistent decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel agentic workflow featured by its abilities to perceive, reflect and plan. Specifically, we find LLaVA-7B can be fine-tuned to perceive the direction and distance of landmarks with sufficient accuracy for city navigation. Moreover, reflection is achieved through a memory mechanism, where past experiences are stored and can be retrieved with current perception for effective decision argumentation. Planning uses reflection results to produce long-term plans, which can avoid short-sighted decisions in long-range navigation. We show the designed workflow significantly improves navigation ability of the LLM agent compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>MMRole: A Comprehensive Framework for Developing and Evaluating Multimodal Role-Playing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential to deliver emotional value and facilitate sociological research. However, existing studies are primarily confined to the textual modality, unable to simulate humans' multimodal perceptual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs), and propose a comprehensive framework, MMRole, for their development and evaluation, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation method. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, MMRole-Data, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues. Additionally, we present a robust evaluation method, MMRole-Eval, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is trained to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison. Moreover, we develop the first specialized MRPA, MMRole-Agent. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the improved performance of MMRole-Agent and highlight the primary challenges in developing MRPAs, emphasizing the need for enhanced multimodal understanding and role-playing consistency. The data, code, and models will be available at https://github.com/YanqiDai/MMRole.</description>

      <title>KnowPC: Knowledge-Driven Programmatic Reinforcement Learning for Zero-shot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) remains a major challenge in the cooperative AI field, which aims to learn an agent to cooperate with an unseen partner in training environments or even novel environments. In recent years, a popular ZSC solution paradigm has been deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with advanced self-play or population-based methods to enhance the neural policy's ability to handle unseen partners. Despite some success, these approaches usually rely on black-box neural networks as the policy function. However, neural networks typically lack interpretability and logic, making the learned policies difficult for partners (e.g., humans) to understand and limiting their generalization ability. These shortcomings hinder the application of reinforcement learning methods in diverse cooperative scenarios.We suggest to represent the agent's policy with an interpretable program. Unlike neural networks, programs contain stable logic, but they are non-differentiable and difficult to optimize.To automatically learn such programs, we introduce Knowledge-driven Programmatic reinforcement learning for zero-shot Coordination (KnowPC). We first define a foundational Domain-Specific Language (DSL), including program structures, conditional primitives, and action primitives. A significant challenge is the vast program search space, making it difficult to find high-performing programs efficiently. To address this, KnowPC integrates an extractor and an reasoner. The extractor discovers environmental transition knowledge from multi-agent interaction trajectories, while the reasoner deduces the preconditions of each action primitive based on the transition knowledge.</description>

      <title>Non-maximizing policies that fulfill multi-criterion aspirations in expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic programming and reinforcement learning, the policy for the sequential decision making of an agent in a stochastic environment is usually determined by expressing the goal as a scalar reward function and seeking a policy that maximizes the expected total reward. However, many goals that humans care about naturally concern multiple aspects of the world, and it may not be obvious how to condense those into a single reward function. Furthermore, maximization suffers from specification gaming, where the obtained policy achieves a high expected total reward in an unintended way, often taking extreme or nonsensical actions.
  Here we consider finite acyclic Markov Decision Processes with multiple distinct evaluation metrics, which do not necessarily represent quantities that the user wants to be maximized. We assume the task of the agent is to ensure that the vector of expected totals of the evaluation metrics falls into some given convex set, called the aspiration set. Our algorithm guarantees that this task is fulfilled by using simplices to approximate feasibility sets and propagate aspirations forward while ensuring they remain feasible. It has complexity linear in the number of possible state-action-successor triples and polynomial in the number of evaluation metrics. Moreover, the explicitly non-maximizing nature of the chosen policy and goals yields additional degrees of freedom, which can be used to apply heuristic safety criteria to the choice of actions. We discuss several such safety criteria that aim to steer the agent towards more conservative behavior.</description>

      <title>RiskAwareBench: Towards Evaluating Physical Risk Awareness for High-level Planning of LLM-based Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics significantly enhances the capabilities of embodied agents in understanding and executing complex natural language instructions. However, the unmitigated deployment of LLM-based embodied systems in real-world environments may pose potential physical risks, such as property damage and personal injury. Existing security benchmarks for LLMs overlook risk awareness for LLM-based embodied agents. To address this gap, we propose RiskAwareBench, an automated framework designed to assess physical risks awareness in LLM-based embodied agents. RiskAwareBench consists of four modules: safety tips generation, risky scene generation, plan generation, and evaluation, enabling comprehensive risk assessment with minimal manual intervention. Utilizing this framework, we compile the PhysicalRisk dataset, encompassing diverse scenarios with associated safety tips, observations, and instructions. Extensive experiments reveal that most LLMs exhibit insufficient physical risk awareness, and baseline risk mitigation strategies yield limited enhancement, which emphasizes the urgency and cruciality of improving risk awareness in LLM-based embodied agents in the future.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Study Regulations in Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in automating reasoning with and about study regulations, catering to various stakeholders, ranging from administrators, over faculty, to students at different stages. Our work builds on an extensive analysis of various study programs at the University of Potsdam. The conceptualization of the underlying principles provides us with a formal account of study regulations. In particular, the formalization reveals the properties of admissible study plans. With these at end, we propose an encoding of study regulations in Answer Set Programming that produces corresponding study plans. Finally, we show how this approach can be extended to a generic user interface for exploring study plans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is essential for enhancing the transparency and accountability of AI models, especially in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper introduces SCENE (Soft Counterfactual Evaluation for Natural language Explainability), a novel evaluation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate Soft Counterfactual explanations in a zero-shot manner. By focusing on token-based substitutions, SCENE creates contextually appropriate and seman-tically meaningful Soft Counterfactuals without extensive fine-tuning. SCENE adopts Validitysoft and Csoft metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of model-agnostic XAI methods in text classification tasks. Applied to CNN, RNN, and BERT architectures, SCENE provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of various XAI techniques.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Visual Analytics Framework for Evaluating Evolutionary Processes in Multi-objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems. In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes, leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.</description>

      <title>HOAA: Hybrid Overestimating Approximate Adder for Enhanced Performance Processing Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Hybrid Overestimating Approximate Adder designed to enhance the performance in processing engines, specifically focused on edge AI applications. A novel Plus One Adder design is proposed as an incremental adder in the RCA chain, incorporating a Full Adder with an excess 1 alongside inputs A, B, and Cin. The design approximates outputs to 2 bit values to reduce hardware complexity and improve resource efficiency. The Plus One Adder is integrated into a dynamically reconfigurable HOAA, allowing runtime interchangeability between accurate and approximate overestimation modes. The proposed design is demonstrated for multiple applications, such as Twos complement subtraction and Rounding to even, and the Configurable Activation function, which are critical components of the Processing engine. Our approach shows 21 percent improvement in area efficiency and 33 percent reduction in power consumption, compared to state of the art designs with minimal accuracy loss. Thus, the proposed HOAA could be a promising solution for resource-constrained environments, offering ideal trade-offs between hardware efficiency vs computational accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What do we want from machine intelligence? We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called ``thought partners,'' systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Anthropomorphizing Large Language Models in Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in learning environments to support teaching-be it as learning companions or as tutors. With our contribution, we aim to discuss the implications of the anthropomorphization of LLMs in learning environments on educational theory to build a foundation for more effective learning outcomes and understand their emotional impact on learners. According to the media equation, people tend to respond to media in the same way as they would respond to another person. A study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology showed that chatbots can be successfully implemented in learning environments. In this study, learners in selected online courses were unable to distinguish the chatbot from a "real" teacher. As LLM-based chatbots such as OpenAI's GPT series are increasingly used in educational tools, it is important to understand how the attribution processes to LLM-based chatbots in terms of anthropomorphization affect learners' emotions.</description>

      <title>Prompting for products: Investigating design space exploration strategies for text-to-image generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models are enabling efficient design space exploration, rapidly generating images from text prompts. However, many generative AI tools are imperfect for product design applications as they are not built for the goals and requirements of product design. The unclear link between text input and image output further complicates their application. This work empirically investigates design space exploration strategies that can successfully yield product images that are feasible, novel, and aesthetic, which are three common goals in product design. Specifically, user actions within the global and local editing modes, including their time spent, prompt length, mono vs. multi-criteria prompts, and goal orientation of prompts, are analyzed. Key findings reveal the pivotal role of mono vs. multi-criteria and goal orientation of prompts in achieving specific design goals over time and prompt length. The study recommends prioritizing the use of multi-criteria prompts for feasibility and novelty during global editing, while favoring mono-criteria prompts for aesthetics during local editing. Overall, this paper underscores the nuanced relationship between the AI-driven text-to-image models and their effectiveness in product design, urging designers to carefully structure prompts during different editing modes to better meet the unique demands of product design.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become an indispensable component of modern technology. However, research on human behavioral responses is lagging behind, i.e., the research into human reliance on AI advice (AI reliance). Current shortcomings in the literature include the unclear influences on AI reliance, lack of external validity, conflicting approaches to measuring reliance, and disregard for a change in reliance over time. Promising avenues for future research include reliance on generative AI output and reliance in multi-user situations. In conclusion, we present a morphological box that serves as a guide for research on AI reliance.</description>

Abstract: To alleviate energy shortages and environmental impacts caused by transportation, this study introduces EcoFollower, a novel eco-car-following model developed using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize fuel consumption in car-following scenarios. Employing the NGSIM datasets, the performance of EcoFollower was assessed in comparison with the well-established Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). The findings demonstrate that EcoFollower excels in simulating realistic driving behaviors, maintaining smooth vehicle operations, and closely matching the ground truth metrics of time-to-collision (TTC), headway, and comfort. Notably, the model achieved a significant reduction in fuel consumption, lowering it by 10.42\% compared to actual driving scenarios. These results underscore the capability of RL-based models like EcoFollower to enhance autonomous vehicle algorithms, promoting safer and more energy-efficient driving strategies.</description>

      <title>A self-adaptive system of systems architecture to enable its ad-hoc scalability: Unmanned Vehicle Fleet -- Mission Control Center Case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A System of Systems (SoS) comprises Constituent Systems (CSs) that interact to provide unique capabilities beyond any single CS. A key challenge in SoS is ad-hoc scalability, meaning the system size changes during operation by adding or removing CSs. This research focuses on an Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) as a practical SoS example, addressing uncertainties like mission changes, range extensions, and UV failures. The proposed solution involves a self-adaptive system that dynamically adjusts UVF architecture, allowing the Mission Control Center (MCC) to scale UVF size automatically based on performance criteria or manually by operator decision. A multi-agent environment and rule management engine were implemented to simulate and verify this approach.</description>

      <title>Telecom Foundation Models: Applications, Challenges, and Future Trends</title>

Abstract: Telecom networks are becoming increasingly complex, with diversified deployment scenarios, multi-standards, and multi-vendor support. The intricate nature of the telecom network ecosystem presents challenges to effectively manage, operate, and optimize networks. To address these hurdles, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted to solve different tasks in telecom networks. However, these conventional AI models are often designed for specific tasks, rely on extensive and costly-to-collect labeled data that require specialized telecom expertise for development and maintenance. The AI models usually fail to generalize and support diverse deployment scenarios and applications. In contrast, Foundation Models (FMs) show effective generalization capabilities in various domains in language, vision, and decision-making tasks. FMs can be trained on multiple data modalities generated from the telecom ecosystem and leverage specialized domain knowledge. Moreover, FMs can be fine-tuned to solve numerous specialized tasks with minimal task-specific labeled data and, in some instances, are able to leverage context to solve previously unseen problems. At the dawn of 6G, this paper investigates the potential opportunities of using FMs to shape the future of telecom technologies and standards. In particular, the paper outlines a conceptual process for developing Telecom FMs (TFMs) and discusses emerging opportunities for orchestrating specialized TFMs for network configuration, operation, and maintenance. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges of developing and deploying TFMs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Output Diversity Improves Conjugate Gradient-based Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, and adversarial attacks that generate adversarial examples have been studied in this context. Existing studies imply that increasing the diversity of model outputs contributes to improving the attack performance. This study focuses on the Auto Conjugate Gradient (ACG) attack, which is inspired by the conjugate gradient method and has a high diversification performance. We hypothesized that increasing the distance between two consecutive search points would enhance the output diversity. To test our hypothesis, we propose Rescaling-ACG (ReACG), which automatically modifies the two components that significantly affect the distance between two consecutive search points, including the search direction and step size. ReACG showed higher attack performance than that of ACG, and is particularly effective for ImageNet models with several classification classes. Experimental results show that the distance between two consecutive search points enhances the output diversity and may help develop new potent attacks.

      <title>Learning from Noisy Labels for Long-tailed Data via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy labels, which are common in real-world datasets, can significantly impair the training of deep learning models. However, recent adversarial noise-combating methods overlook the long-tailed distribution of real data, which can significantly harm the effect of denoising strategies. Meanwhile, the mismanagement of noisy labels further compromises the model's ability to handle long-tailed data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach to manage data characterized by both long-tailed distributions and noisy labels. First, we introduce a loss-distance cross-selection module, which integrates class predictions and feature distributions to filter clean samples, effectively addressing uncertainties introduced by noisy labels and long-tailed distributions. Subsequently, we employ optimal transport strategies to generate pseudo-labels for the noise set in a semi-supervised training manner, enhancing pseudo-label quality while mitigating the effects of sample scarcity caused by the long-tailed distribution. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available in the future.</description>

      <title>Improving Large Language Model (LLM) fidelity through context-aware grounding: A systematic approach to reliability and veracity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly sophisticated and ubiquitous in natural language processing (NLP) applications, ensuring their robustness, trustworthiness, and alignment with human values has become a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for contextual grounding in textual models, with a particular emphasis on the Context Representation stage. Our approach aims to enhance the reliability and ethical alignment of these models through a comprehensive, context-aware methodology. By explicitly capturing and representing relevant situational, cultural, and ethical contexts in a machine-readable format, we lay the foundation for anchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies, semantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our framework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving model performance, fairness, and alignment with human expectations, while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the other key components of the framework, including context-aware encoding, context-aware learning, interpretability and explainability, and continuous monitoring and adaptation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on responsible AI, offering a practical approach to developing more reliable, trustworthy, and ethically-aligned language models. Our findings have significant implications for the deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains such as healthcare, legal systems, and social services, where contextual understanding is paramount.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Gender Fairness in Depression Prediction: Insights on Data from the USA &amp; China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social agents and robots are increasingly being used in wellbeing settings. However, a key challenge is that these agents and robots typically rely on machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect and analyse an individual's mental wellbeing. The problem of bias and fairness in ML algorithms is becoming an increasingly greater source of concern. In concurrence, existing literature has also indicated that mental health conditions can manifest differently across genders and cultures. We hypothesise that the representation of features (acoustic, textual, and visual) and their inter-modal relations would vary among subjects from different cultures and genders, thus impacting the performance and fairness of various ML models. We present the very first evaluation of multimodal gender fairness in depression manifestation by undertaking a study on two different datasets from the USA and China. We undertake thorough statistical and ML experimentation and repeat the experiments for several different algorithms to ensure that the results are not algorithm-dependent. Our findings indicate that though there are differences between both datasets, it is not conclusive whether this is due to the difference in depression manifestation as hypothesised or other external factors such as differences in data collection methodology. Our findings further motivate a call for a more consistent and culturally aware data collection process in order to address the problem of ML bias in depression detection and to promote the development of fairer agents and robots for wellbeing.</description>

      <title>Learning Rate-Free Reinforcement Learning: A Case for Model Selection with Non-Stationary Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, with the learning rate being particularly influential. RL algorithms fail to reach convergence or demand an extensive number of samples when the learning rate is not optimally set. In this work, we show that model selection can help to improve the failure modes of RL that are due to suboptimal choices of learning rate. We present a model selection framework for Learning Rate-Free Reinforcement Learning that employs model selection methods to select the optimal learning rate on the fly. This approach of adaptive learning rate tuning neither depends on the underlying RL algorithm nor the optimizer and solely uses the reward feedback to select the learning rate; hence, the framework can input any RL algorithm and produce a learning rate-free version of it. We conduct experiments for policy optimization methods and evaluate various model selection strategies within our framework. Our results indicate that data-driven model selection algorithms are better alternatives to standard bandit algorithms when the optimal choice of hyperparameter is time-dependent and non-stationary.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Reward-Driven Tuning of Scanning Probe Microscopy: Towards Fully Automated Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.</description>

      <title>PowerPM: Foundation Model for Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image datasets serve as the foundation for machine learning models in computer vision, significantly influencing model capabilities, performance, and biases alongside architectural considerations. Therefore, understanding the composition and distribution of these datasets has become increasingly crucial. To address the need for intuitive exploration of these datasets, we propose AEye, an extensible and scalable visualization tool tailored to image datasets. AEye utilizes a contrastively trained model to embed images into semantically meaningful high-dimensional representations, facilitating data clustering and organization. To visualize the high-dimensional representations, we project them onto a two-dimensional plane and arrange images in layers so users can seamlessly navigate and explore them interactively. AEye facilitates semantic search functionalities for both text and image queries, enabling users to search for content. We open-source the codebase for AEye, and provide a simple configuration to add datasets.</description>

      <title>ArtVLM: Attribute Recognition Through Vision-Based Prefix Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing and disentangling visual attributes from objects is a foundation to many computer vision applications. While large vision language representations like CLIP had largely resolved the task of zero-shot object recognition, zero-shot visual attribute recognition remains a challenge because CLIP's contrastively-learned vision-language representation cannot effectively capture object-attribute dependencies. In this paper, we target this weakness and propose a sentence generation-based retrieval formulation for attribute recognition that is novel in 1) explicitly modeling a to-be-measured and retrieved object-attribute relation as a conditional probability graph, which converts the recognition problem into a dependency-sensitive language-modeling problem, and 2) applying a large pretrained Vision-Language Model (VLM) on this reformulation and naturally distilling its knowledge of image-object-attribute relations to use towards attribute recognition. Specifically, for each attribute to be recognized on an image, we measure the visual-conditioned probability of generating a short sentence encoding the attribute's relation to objects on the image. Unlike contrastive retrieval, which measures likelihood by globally aligning elements of the sentence to the image, generative retrieval is sensitive to the order and dependency of objects and attributes in the sentence. We demonstrate through experiments that generative retrieval consistently outperforms contrastive retrieval on two visual reasoning datasets, Visual Attribute in the Wild (VAW), and our newly-proposed Visual Genome Attribute Ranking (VGARank).</description>

      <title>Hardware-Assisted Virtualization of Neural Processing Units for Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud platforms today have been deploying hardware accelerators like neural processing units (NPUs) for powering machine learning (ML) inference services. To maximize the resource utilization while ensuring reasonable quality of service, a natural approach is to virtualize NPUs for efficient resource sharing for multi-tenant ML services. However, virtualizing NPUs for modern cloud platforms is not easy. This is not only due to the lack of system abstraction support for NPU hardware, but also due to the lack of architectural and ISA support for enabling fine-grained dynamic operator scheduling for virtualized NPUs.
  We present TCloud, a holistic NPU virtualization framework. We investigate virtualization techniques for NPUs across the entire software and hardware stack. TCloud consists of (1) a flexible NPU abstraction called vNPU, which enables fine-grained virtualization of the heterogeneous compute units in a physical NPU (pNPU); (2) a vNPU resource allocator that enables pay-as-you-go computing model and flexible vNPU-to-pNPU mappings for improved resource utilization and cost-effectiveness; (3) an ISA extension of modern NPU architecture for facilitating fine-grained tensor operator scheduling for multiple vNPUs. We implement TCloud based on a production-level NPU simulator. Our experiments show that TCloud improves the throughput of ML inference services by up to 1.4$\times$ and reduces the tail latency by up to 4.6$\times$, while improving the NPU utilization by 1.2$\times$ on average, compared to state-of-the-art NPU sharing approaches.</description>

      <title>Patchview: LLM-Powered Worldbuilding with Generative Dust and Magnet Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can help writers build story worlds by generating world elements, such as factions, characters, and locations. However, making sense of many generated elements can be overwhelming. Moreover, if the user wants to precisely control aspects of generated elements that are difficult to specify verbally, prompting alone may be insufficient. We introduce Patchview, a customizable LLM-powered system that visually aids worldbuilding by allowing users to interact with story concepts and elements through the physical metaphor of magnets and dust. Elements in Patchview are visually dragged closer to concepts with high relevance, facilitating sensemaking. The user can also steer the generation with verbally elusive concepts by indicating the desired position of the element between concepts. When the user disagrees with the LLM's visualization and generation, they can correct those by repositioning the element. These corrections can be used to align the LLM's future behaviors to the user's perception. With a user study, we show that Patchview supports the sensemaking of world elements and steering of element generation, facilitating exploration during the worldbuilding process. Patchview provides insights on how customizable visual representation can help sensemake, steer, and align generative AI model behaviors with the user's intentions.</description>

      <title>Can Rule-Based Insights Enhance LLMs for Radiology Report Classification? Introducing the RadPrompt Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing imaging models capable of detecting pathologies from chest X-rays can be cost and time-prohibitive for large datasets as it requires supervision to attain state-of-the-art performance. Instead, labels extracted from radiology reports may serve as distant supervision since these are routinely generated as part of clinical practice. Despite their widespread use, current rule-based methods for label extraction rely on extensive rule sets that are limited in their robustness to syntactic variability. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce RadPert, a rule-based system that integrates an uncertainty-aware information schema with a streamlined set of rules, enhancing performance. Additionally, we have developed RadPrompt, a multi-turn prompting strategy that leverages RadPert to bolster the zero-shot predictive capabilities of large language models, achieving a statistically significant improvement in weighted average F1 score over GPT-4 Turbo. Most notably, RadPrompt surpasses both its underlying models, showcasing the synergistic potential of LLMs with rule-based models. We have evaluated our methods on two English Corpora: the MIMIC-CXR gold-standard test set and a gold-standard dataset collected from the Cambridge University Hospitals.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Healthcare through Large Language Models: A Study on Medical Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has shown significant promise in improving the accessibility and dissemination of medical knowledge. This paper presents a detailed study of various LLMs trained on the MedQuAD medical question-answering dataset, with a focus on identifying the most effective model for providing accurate medical information. Among the models tested, the Sentence-t5 combined with Mistral 7B demonstrated superior performance, achieving a precision score of 0.762. This model's enhanced capabilities are attributed to its advanced pretraining techniques, robust architecture, and effective prompt construction methodologies. By leveraging these strengths, the Sentence-t5 + Mistral 7B model excels in understanding and generating precise medical answers. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating sophisticated LLMs in medical contexts to facilitate efficient and accurate medical knowledge retrieval, thus significantly enhancing patient education and support.</description>

      <title>UNLEARN Efficient Removal of Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and the prohibitive cost of training these models from scratch, dynamically forgetting specific knowledge e.g., private or proprietary, without retraining the model has become an important capability. This paper proposes a novel method to achieve this objective called UNLEARN. The approach builds upon subspace methods to identify and specifically target the removal of knowledge without adversely affecting other knowledge in the LLM. Results demonstrate 96% of targeted knowledge can be forgotten while maintaining performance on other knowledge within 2.5% of the original model, significantly outperforming the discriminatory abilities of the previous state-of-the-art. A dual method called LEARN is also proposed for targeted knowledge addition. Results show LEARN can match the fine-tuning accuracy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) without adversely affecting similar tasks.</description>

      <title>The Data Addition Dilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many machine learning for healthcare tasks, standard datasets are constructed by amassing data across many, often fundamentally dissimilar, sources. But when does adding more data help, and when does it hinder progress on desired model outcomes in real-world settings? We identify this situation as the \textit{Data Addition Dilemma}, demonstrating that adding training data in this multi-source scaling context can at times result in reduced overall accuracy, uncertain fairness outcomes, and reduced worst-subgroup performance. We find that this possibly arises from an empirically observed trade-off between model performance improvements due to data scaling and model deterioration from distribution shift. We thus establish baseline strategies for navigating this dilemma, introducing distribution shift heuristics to guide decision-making on which data sources to add in data scaling, in order to yield the expected model performance improvements. We conclude with a discussion of the required considerations for data collection and suggestions for studying data composition and scale in the age of increasingly larger models.</description>

      <title>wav2graph: A Framework for Supervised Learning Knowledge Graph from Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) and search engines by providing structured, interconnected data that improves reasoning and context-awareness. However, KGs only focus on text data, thereby neglecting other modalities such as speech. In this work, we introduce wav2graph, the first framework for supervised learning knowledge graph from speech data. Our pipeline are straightforward: (1) constructing a KG based on transcribed spoken utterances and a named entity database, (2) converting KG into embedding vectors, and (3) training graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification and link prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments conducted in inductive and transductive learning contexts using state-of-the-art GNN models, we provide baseline results and error analysis for node classification and link prediction tasks on human transcripts and automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, including evaluations using both encoder-based and decoder-based node embeddings, as well as monolingual and multilingual acoustic pre-trained models. All related code, data, and models are published online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of adversarial attacks on Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has created a need for innovative security measures. However, the current methods of defending against these attacks often come with a high computing cost and require back-end processing, making real-time defense challenging. Fortunately, there have been remarkable advancements in edge-computing, which make it easier to deploy neural networks on edge devices. Building upon these advancements, we propose an edge framework design to enable universal and efficient detection of adversarial attacks. This framework incorporates an attention-based adversarial detection methodology and a lightweight detection network formation, making it suitable for a wide range of neural networks and can be deployed on edge devices. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted evaluations on five neural networks. The results indicate an impressive 97.43% F-score can be achieved, demonstrating the framework's proficiency in detecting adversarial attacks. Moreover, our proposed framework also exhibits significantly reduced computing complexity and cost in comparison to previous detection methods. This aspect is particularly beneficial as it ensures that the defense mechanism can be efficiently implemented in real-time on-edge devices.</description>

      <title>Listwise Reward Estimation for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), designing precise reward functions remains to be a challenge, particularly when aligning with human intent. Preference-based RL (PbRL) was introduced to address this problem by learning reward models from human feedback. However, existing PbRL methods have limitations as they often overlook the second-order preference that indicates the relative strength of preference. In this paper, we propose Listwise Reward Estimation (LiRE), a novel approach for offline PbRL that leverages second-order preference information by constructing a Ranked List of Trajectories (RLT), which can be efficiently built by using the same ternary feedback type as traditional methods. To validate the effectiveness of LiRE, we propose a new offline PbRL dataset that objectively reflects the effect of the estimated rewards. Our extensive experiments on the dataset demonstrate the superiority of LiRE, i.e., outperforming state-of-the-art baselines even with modest feedback budgets and enjoying robustness with respect to the number of feedbacks and feedback noise. Our code is available at https://github.com/chwoong/LiRE</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Crime Prediction With Spatial Temporal Multivariate Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crime forecasting is a critical component of urban analysis and essential for stabilizing society today. Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Judgment Formulation for Semantic Embedding Model in Web Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), a neural network-based Siamese architecture, is gaining momentum in information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to train SEM in a supervised fashion for Web search, the search engine query log is typically utilized to automatically formulate pairwise judgments as training data. Despite the growing application of semantic embeddings in the search engine industry, little work has been done on formulating effective pairwise judgments for training SEM. In this paper, we make the first in-depth investigation of a wide range of strategies for generating pairwise judgments for SEM. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that the conventional pairwise judgment formulation strategy wildly used in the field of pairwise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is not necessarily effective for training SEM. Through a large-scale empirical study based on query logs and click-through activities from a major commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effective strategies for SEM and highlight the advantages of a hybrid heuristic (i.e., Clicked &gt; Non-Clicked) in comparison to the atomic heuristics (e.g., Clicked &gt; Skipped) in LTR. We conclude with best practices for training SEM and offer promising insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Attention Mechanism and Context Modeling System for Text Mining Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advances a novel architectural schema anchored upon the Transformer paradigm and innovatively amalgamates the K-means categorization algorithm to augment the contextual apprehension capabilities of the schema. The transformer model performs well in machine translation tasks due to its parallel computing power and multi-head attention mechanism. However, it may encounter contextual ambiguity or ignore local features when dealing with highly complex language structures. To circumvent this constraint, this exposition incorporates the K-Means algorithm, which is used to stratify the lexis and idioms of the input textual matter, thereby facilitating superior identification and preservation of the local structure and contextual intelligence of the language. The advantage of this combination is that K-Means can automatically discover the topic or concept regions in the text, which may be directly related to translation quality. Consequently, the schema contrived herein enlists K-Means as a preparatory phase antecedent to the Transformer and recalibrates the multi-head attention weights to assist in the discrimination of lexis and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities. This ensures the schema accords heightened regard to the contextual intelligence embodied by these clusters during the training phase, rather than merely focusing on locational intelligence.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DM) have become fundamental components of generative models, excelling across various domains such as image creation, audio generation, and complex data interpolation. Signal-to-Noise diffusion models constitute a diverse family covering most state-of-the-art diffusion models. While there have been several attempts to study Signal-to-Noise (S2N) diffusion models from various perspectives, there remains a need for a comprehensive study connecting different viewpoints and exploring new perspectives. In this study, we offer a comprehensive perspective on noise schedulers, examining their role through the lens of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its connections to information theory. Building upon this framework, we have developed a generalized backward equation to enhance the performance of the inference process.</description>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However, models falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.</description>

Abstract: A probabilistic circuit (PC) succinctly expresses a function that represents a multivariate probability distribution and, given sufficient structural properties of the circuit, supports efficient probabilistic inference. Typically a PC computes the probability mass (or density) function (PMF or PDF) of the distribution. We consider PCs instead computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF). We show that for distributions over binary random variables these representations (PMF and CDF) are essentially equivalent, in the sense that one can be transformed to the other in polynomial time. We then show how a similar equivalence holds for distributions over finite discrete variables using a modification of the standard encoding with binary variables that aligns with the CDF semantics. Finally we show that for continuous variables, smooth, decomposable PCs computing PDFs and CDFs can be efficiently transformed to each other by modifying only the leaves of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Wide Task Slowdown Detection in Cloud System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Slow task detection is a critical problem in cloud operation and maintenance since it is highly related to user experience and can bring substantial liquidated damages. Most anomaly detection methods detect it from a single-task aspect. However, considering millions of concurrent tasks in large-scale cloud computing clusters, it becomes impractical and inefficient. Moreover, single-task slowdowns are very common and do not necessarily indicate a malfunction of a cluster due to its violent fluctuation nature in a virtual environment. Thus, we shift our attention to cluster-wide task slowdowns by utilizing the duration time distribution of tasks across a cluster, so that the computation complexity is not relevant to the number of tasks.
  The task duration time distribution often exhibits compound periodicity and local exceptional fluctuations over time. Though transformer-based methods are one of the most powerful methods to capture these time series normal variation patterns, we empirically find and theoretically explain the flaw of the standard attention mechanism in reconstructing subperiods with low amplitude when dealing with compound periodicity.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose SORN (i.e., Skimming Off subperiods in descending amplitude order and Reconstructing Non-slowing fluctuation), which consists of a Skimming Attention mechanism to reconstruct the compound periodicity and a Neural Optimal Transport module to distinguish cluster-wide slowdowns from other exceptional fluctuations. Furthermore, since anomalies in the training set are inevitable in a practical scenario, we propose a picky loss function, which adaptively assigns higher weights to reliable time slots in the training set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SORN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world industrial datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning systems have demonstrated substantial abilities with methods that either embrace or ignore human-provided knowledge, but combining benefits of both styles remains a challenge. One particular challenge involves designing learning systems that exhibit built-in responses to specific abstract stimulus patterns, yet are still plastic enough to be agnostic about the modality and exact form of their inputs. In this paper, we investigate what we call The Ungrounded Alignment Problem, which asks How can we build in predefined knowledge in a system where we don't know how a given stimulus will be grounded? This paper examines a simplified version of the general problem, where an unsupervised learner is presented with a sequence of images for the characters in a text corpus, and this learner is later evaluated on its ability to recognize specific (possibly rare) sequential patterns. Importantly, the learner is given no labels during learning or evaluation, but must map images from an unknown font or permutation to its correct class label. That is, at no point is our learner given labeled images, where an image vector is explicitly associated with a class label. Despite ample work in unsupervised and self-supervised loss functions, all current methods require a labeled fine-tuning phase to map the learned representations to correct classes. Finding this mapping in the absence of labels may seem a fool's errand, but our main result resolves this seeming paradox. We show that leveraging only letter bigram frequencies is sufficient for an unsupervised learner both to reliably associate images to class labels and to reliably identify trigger words in the sequence of inputs. More generally, this method suggests an approach for encoding specific desired innate behaviour in modality-agnostic models.</description>

      <title>Scalable Transformer for High Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep models for Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting have recently demonstrated significant success. Channel-dependent models capture complex dependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the number of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of existing channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some models underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional data, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models. To address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal performance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our analysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from unrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial inter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable Transformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting. STHD has three components: a) Relation Matrix Sparsity that limits the noise introduced and alleviates the memory issue; b) ReIndex applied as a training strategy to enable a more flexible batch size setting and increase the diversity of training data; and c) Transformer that handles 2-D inputs and captures channel dependencies. These components jointly enable STHD to manage the high-dimensional MTS while maintaining computational feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show STHD's considerable improvement on three high-dimensional datasets: Crime-Chicago, Wiki-People, and Traffic. The source code and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/xinzzzhou/ScalableTransformer4HighDimensionMTSF.git.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods encounter difficulties when addressing complex questions like multi-hop queries. While iterative retrieval methods improve performance by gathering additional information, current approaches often rely on multiple calls of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce EfficientRAG, an efficient retriever for multi-hop question answering. EfficientRAG iteratively generates new queries without the need for LLM calls at each iteration and filters out irrelevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientRAG surpasses existing RAG methods on three open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Hidden Visual Information: A Reconstruction Attack Against Adversarial Visual Information Hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the security vulnerabilities of adversarial-example-based image encryption by executing data reconstruction (DR) attacks on encrypted images. A representative image encryption method is the adversarial visual information hiding (AVIH), which uses type-I adversarial example training to protect gallery datasets used in image recognition tasks. In the AVIH method, the type-I adversarial example approach creates images that appear completely different but are still recognized by machines as the original ones. Additionally, the AVIH method can restore encrypted images to their original forms using a predefined private key generative model. For the best security, assigning a unique key to each image is recommended; however, storage limitations may necessitate some images sharing the same key model. This raises a crucial security question for AVIH: How many images can safely share the same key model without being compromised by a DR attack? To address this question, we introduce a dual-strategy DR attack against the AVIH encryption method by incorporating (1) generative-adversarial loss and (2) augmented identity loss, which prevent DR from overfitting -- an issue akin to that in machine learning. Our numerical results validate this approach through image recognition and re-identification benchmarks, demonstrating that our strategy can significantly enhance the quality of reconstructed images, thereby requiring fewer key-sharing encrypted images. Our source code to reproduce our results will be available soon.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Chatbot for Intrusion Detection in Edge Networks: Enhancing Cybersecurity with Ethical User Consent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's contemporary digital landscape, chatbots have become indispensable tools across various sectors, streamlining customer service, providing personal assistance, automating routine tasks, and offering health advice. However, their potential remains underexplored in the realm of network security, particularly for intrusion detection. To bridge this gap, we propose an architecture chatbot specifically designed to enhance security within edge networks specifically for intrusion detection. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this chatbot will monitor network traffic to identify and mitigate potential intrusions. By securing the network environment using an edge network managed by a Raspberry Pi module and ensuring ethical user consent promoting transparency and trust, this innovative solution aims to safeguard sensitive data and maintain a secure workplace, thereby addressing the growing need for robust network security measures in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Assigning Credit with Partial Reward Decoupling in Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) has recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on challenging multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks. However, MAPPO still struggles with the credit assignment problem, wherein the sheer difficulty in ascribing credit to individual agents' actions scales poorly with team size. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that adapts recent developments in credit assignment to improve upon MAPPO. Our approach leverages partial reward decoupling (PRD), which uses a learned attention mechanism to estimate which of a particular agent's teammates are relevant to its learning updates. We use this estimate to dynamically decompose large groups of agents into smaller, more manageable subgroups. We empirically demonstrate that our approach, PRD-MAPPO, decouples agents from teammates that do not influence their expected future reward, thereby streamlining credit assignment. We additionally show that PRD-MAPPO yields significantly higher data efficiency and asymptotic performance compared to both MAPPO and other state-of-the-art methods across several multi-agent tasks, including StarCraft II. Finally, we propose a version of PRD-MAPPO that is applicable to \textit{shared} reward settings, where PRD was previously not applicable, and empirically show that this also leads to performance improvements over MAPPO.</description>

      <title>Tackling Noisy Clients in Federated Learning with End-to-end Label Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, federated learning (FL) has achieved wide successes for diverse privacy-sensitive applications without sacrificing the sensitive private information of clients. However, the data quality of client datasets can not be guaranteed since corresponding annotations of different clients often contain complex label noise of varying degrees, which inevitably causes the performance degradation. Intuitively, the performance degradation is dominated by clients with higher noise rates since their trained models contain more misinformation from data, thus it is necessary to devise an effective optimization scheme to mitigate the negative impacts of these noisy clients. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework FedELC to tackle this complicated label noise issue. The first stage aims to guide the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise, while the second stage aims to correct the labels of noisy clients' data via an end-to-end label correction framework which is achieved by learning possible ground-truth labels of noisy clients' datasets via back propagation. We implement sixteen related methods and evaluate five datasets with three types of complicated label noise scenarios for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework achieves superior performance than its counterparts for different scenarios. Additionally, we effectively improve the data quality of detected noisy clients' local datasets with our label correction framework.

      <title>Learning with Digital Agents: An Analysis based on the Activity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital agents are considered a general-purpose technology. They spread quickly in private and organizational contexts, including education. Yet, research lacks a conceptual framing to describe interaction with such agents in a holistic manner. While focusing on the interaction with a pedagogical agent, i.e., a digital agent capable of natural-language interaction with a learner, we propose a model of learning activity based on activity theory. We use this model and a review of prior research on digital agents in education to analyze how various characteristics of the activity, including features of a pedagogical agent or learner, influence learning outcomes. The analysis leads to identification of IS research directions and guidance for developers of pedagogical agents and digital agents in general. We conclude by extending the activity theory-based model beyond the context of education and show how it helps designers and researchers ask the right questions when creating a digital agent.</description>

      <title>Towards Explainable Network Intrusion Detection using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing tasks, particularly as chat agents. However, their applicability to threat detection problems remains unclear. This paper examines the feasibility of employing LLMs as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), despite their high computational requirements, primarily for the sake of explainability. Furthermore, considerable resources have been invested in developing LLMs, and they may offer utility for NIDS. Current state-of-the-art NIDS rely on artificial benchmarking datasets, resulting in skewed performance when applied to real-world networking environments. Therefore, we compare the GPT-4 and LLama3 models against traditional architectures and transformer-based models to assess their ability to detect malicious NetFlows without depending on artificially skewed datasets, but solely on their vast pre-trained acquired knowledge. Our results reveal that, although LLMs struggle with precise attack detection, they hold significant potential for a path towards explainable NIDS. Our preliminary exploration shows that LLMs are unfit for the detection of Malicious NetFlows. Most promisingly, however, these exhibit significant potential as complementary agents in NIDS, particularly in providing explanations and aiding in threat response when integrated with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CNOT optimization plays a significant role in noise reduction for Quantum Circuits. Several heuristic and exact approaches exist for CNOT optimization. In this paper, we investigate more complicated variations of optimal synthesis by allowing qubit permutations and handling layout restrictions. We encode such problems into Planning, SAT, and QBF. We provide optimization for both CNOT gate count and circuit depth. For experimental evaluation, we consider standard T-gate optimized benchmarks and optimize CNOT sub-circuits. We show that allowing qubit permutations can further reduce up to 56% in CNOT count and 46% in circuit depth. In the case of optimally mapped circuits under layout restrictions, we observe a reduction up to 17% CNOT count and 19% CNOT depth.</description>

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is a critical challenge across various domains. Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in immediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal dynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require extensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for time series anomaly prediction, incorporating temporal information directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset specifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive experiments using several state-of-the-art methods. results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and accurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Judgment2vec: Apply Graph Analytics to Searching and Recommendation of Similar Judgments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In court practice, legal professionals rely on their training to provide opinions that resolve cases, one of the most crucial aspects being the ability to identify similar judgments from previous courts efficiently. However, finding a similar case is challenging and often depends on experience, legal domain knowledge, and extensive labor hours, making veteran lawyers or judges indispensable. This research aims to automate the analysis of judgment text similarity. We utilized a judgment dataset labeled as the "golden standard" by experts, which includes human-verified features that can be converted into an "expert similarity score." We then constructed a knowledge graph based on "case-article" relationships, ranking each case using natural language processing to derive a "Node2vec similarity score." By evaluating these two similarity scores, we identified their discrepancies and relationships. The results can significantly reduce the labor hours required for legal searches and recommendations, with potential applications extending to various fields of information retrieval.</description>

      <title>MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance. The dataset, code, and prompts are available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast.</description>

      <title>Automated Educational Question Generation at Different Bloom's Skill Levels using Large Language Models: Strategies and Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing questions that are pedagogically sound, relevant, and promote learning is a challenging and time-consuming task for educators. Modern-day large language models (LLMs) generate high-quality content across multiple domains, potentially helping educators to develop high-quality questions. Automated educational question generation (AEQG) is important in scaling online education catering to a diverse student population. Past attempts at AEQG have shown limited abilities to generate questions at higher cognitive levels. In this study, we examine the ability of five state-of-the-art LLMs of different sizes to generate diverse and high-quality questions of different cognitive levels, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy. We use advanced prompting techniques with varying complexity for AEQG. We conducted expert and LLM-based evaluations to assess the linguistic and pedagogical relevance and quality of the questions. Our findings suggest that LLms can generate relevant and high-quality educational questions of different cognitive levels when prompted with adequate information, although there is a significant variance in the performance of the five LLms considered. We also show that automated evaluation is not on par with human evaluation.</description>

      <title>DIVE: Subgraph Disagreement for Graph Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in graph machine learning, a field rapidly advancing yet grappling with the discrepancy between source and target data distributions. Traditional graph learning algorithms, based on the assumption of uniform distribution between training and test data, falter in real-world scenarios where this assumption fails, resulting in suboptimal performance. A principal factor contributing to this suboptimal performance is the inherent simplicity bias of neural networks trained through Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which prefer simpler features over more complex yet equally or more predictive ones. This bias leads to a reliance on spurious correlations, adversely affecting OOD performance in various tasks such as image recognition, natural language understanding, and graph classification. Current methodologies, including subgraph-mixup and information bottleneck approaches, have achieved partial success but struggle to overcome simplicity bias, often reinforcing spurious correlations. To tackle this, we propose DIVE, training a collection of models to focus on all label-predictive subgraphs by encouraging the models to foster divergence on the subgraph mask, which circumvents the limitation of a model solely focusing on the subgraph corresponding to simple structural patterns. Specifically, we employs a regularizer to punish overlap in extracted subgraphs across models, thereby encouraging different models to concentrate on distinct structural patterns. Model selection for robust OOD performance is achieved through validation accuracy. Tested across four datasets from GOOD benchmark and one dataset from DrugOOD benchmark, our approach demonstrates significant improvement over existing methods, effectively addressing the simplicity bias and enhancing generalization in graph machine learning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Reasoning Biases in Large Language Models Through Syllogism: Insights from the NeuBAROCO Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the question of how accurately current large language models can perform logical reasoning in natural language, with an emphasis on whether these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans. Specifically, our study focuses on syllogistic reasoning, a form of deductive reasoning extensively studied in cognitive science as a natural form of human reasoning. We present a syllogism dataset called NeuBAROCO, which consists of syllogistic reasoning problems in English and Japanese. This dataset was originally designed for psychological experiments to assess human reasoning capabilities using various forms of syllogisms. Our experiments with leading large language models indicate that these models exhibit reasoning biases similar to humans, along with other error tendencies. Notably, there is significant room for improvement in reasoning problems where the relationship between premises and hypotheses is neither entailment nor contradiction. We also present experimental results and in-depth analysis using a new Chain-of-Thought prompting method, which asks LLMs to translate syllogisms into abstract logical expressions and then explain their reasoning process. Our analysis using this method suggests that the primary limitations of LLMs lie in the reasoning process itself rather than the interpretation of syllogisms.</description>

Abstract: Accurate energy demand forecasting is crucial for sustainable and resilient energy development. To meet the Net Zero Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) $4.5$ scenario in the DACH countries, increased renewable energy production, energy storage, and reduced commercial building consumption are needed. This scenario's success depends on hydroelectric capacity and climatic factors. Informed decisions require quantifying uncertainty in forecasts. This study explores a non-parametric method based on \emph{reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS)}, known as kernel quantile regression, for energy prediction. Our experiments demonstrate its reliability and sharpness, and we benchmark it against state-of-the-art methods in load and price forecasting for the DACH region. We offer our implementation in conjunction with additional scripts to ensure the reproducibility of our research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have significantly improved performance in open-domain question answering (QA) by leveraging external knowledge. However, RALMs still struggle with unanswerable queries, where the retrieved contexts do not contain the correct answer, and with conflicting information, where different sources provide contradictory answers due to imperfect retrieval. This study introduces an in-context learning-based approach to enhance the reasoning capabilities of RALMs, making them more robust in imperfect retrieval scenarios. Our method incorporates Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) demonstrations, referred to as cases, to boost the model's capabilities to identify unanswerabilities and conflicts among the retrieved contexts. Experiments on two open-domain QA datasets show that our approach increases accuracy in identifying unanswerable and conflicting scenarios without requiring additional fine-tuning. This work demonstrates that in-context learning can effectively enhance the robustness of RALMs in open-domain QA tasks.</description>

Furthermore, the combination of FL and anomaly detection is particularly compelling because it allows for detecting rare and critical anomalies (usually also rare in locally gathered data) in sensitive data from multiple sources, such as cybersecurity and healthcare. However, benchmarking the performance of anomaly detection methods in FL environments remains an underexplored area. This paper introduces FedAD-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms within the context of FL. We systematically analyze and compare the performance of recent deep learning anomaly detection models under federated settings, which were typically assessed solely in centralized settings. FedAD-Bench encompasses diverse datasets and metrics to provide a holistic evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges such as model aggregation inefficiencies and metric unreliability. We present insights into FL's regularization effects, revealing scenarios in which it outperforms centralized approaches due to its inherent ability to mitigate overfitting. Our work aims to establish a standardized benchmark to guide future research and development in federated anomaly detection, promoting reproducibility and fair comparison across studies.</description>

      <title>SegXAL: Explainable Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Driving Scene Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the sophisticated AI models utilize huge amounts of annotated data and heavy training to achieve high-end performance. However, there are certain challenges that hinder the deployment of AI models "in-the-wild" scenarios, i.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human expertise, and lack of interpretation of the results. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model, XAL-based semantic segmentation model "SegXAL", that can (i) effectively utilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the "Human-in-the-loop" paradigm, and (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way. In particular, we investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in driving scene scenarios. The SegXAL model proposes the image regions that require labeling assistance from Oracle by dint of explainable AI (XAI) and uncertainty measures in a weakly-supervised manner. Specifically, we propose a novel Proximity-aware Explainable-AI (PAE) module and Entropy-based Uncertainty (EBU) module to get an Explainable Error Mask, which enables the machine teachers/human experts to provide intuitive reasoning behind the results and to solicit feedback to the AI system via an active learning strategy. Such a mechanism bridges the semantic gap between man and machine through collaborative intelligence, where humans and AI actively enhance each other's complementary strengths. A novel high-confidence sample selection technique based on the DICE similarity coefficient is also presented within the SegXAL framework. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses are carried out in the benchmarking Cityscape dataset. Results show the outperformance of our proposed SegXAL against other state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the clustering of wireless users by examining the distances between their channel covariance matrices, which reside on the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices. Specifically, we consider an estimator of the Log-Euclidean distance between multiple sample covariance matrices (SCMs) consistent when the number of samples and the observation size grow unbounded at the same rate. Within the context of multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) wireless communication systems, we develop a statistical framework that allows to accurate predictions of the clustering algorithm's performance under realistic conditions. Specifically, we present a central limit theorem that establishes the asymptotic Gaussianity of the consistent estimator of the log-Euclidean distance computed over two sample covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Towards Synergistic Deep Learning Models for Volumetric Cirrhotic Liver Segmentation in MRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liver cirrhosis, a leading cause of global mortality, requires precise segmentation of ROIs for effective disease monitoring and treatment planning. Existing segmentation models often fail to capture complex feature interactions and generalize across diverse datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel synergistic theory that leverages complementary latent spaces for enhanced feature interaction modeling. Our proposed architecture, nnSynergyNet3D integrates continuous and discrete latent spaces for 3D volumes and features auto-configured training. This approach captures both fine-grained and coarse features, enabling effective modeling of intricate feature interactions. We empirically validated nnSynergyNet3D on a private dataset of 628 high-resolution T1 abdominal MRI scans from 339 patients. Our model outperformed the baseline nnUNet3D by approximately 2%. Additionally, zero-shot testing on healthy liver CT scans from the public LiTS dataset demonstrated superior cross-modal generalization capabilities. These results highlight the potential of synergistic latent space models to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness, thereby enhancing clinical workflows by ensuring consistency across CT and MRI modalities.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Multi-modal Semantic CommunicationSystem with Packet-level Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding design has shown promising performance in transmitting data of different modalities over physical layer channels, the synchronization and packet-level forward error correction of multimodal semantics have not been well studied. Due to the independent design of semantic encoders, synchronizing multimodal features in both the semantic and time domains is a challenging problem. In this paper, we take the facial video and speech transmission as an example and propose a Synchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System (SyncSC) with Packet-Level Coding. To achieve semantic and time synchronization, 3D Morphable Mode (3DMM) coefficients and text are transmitted as semantics, and we propose a semantic codec that achieves similar quality of reconstruction and synchronization with lower bandwidth, compared to traditional methods. To protect semantic packets under the erasure channel, we propose a packet-Level Forward Error Correction (FEC) method, called PacSC, that maintains a certain visual quality performance even at high packet loss rates. Particularly, for text packets, a text packet loss concealment module, called TextPC, based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed, which significantly improves the performance of traditional FEC methods. The simulation results show that our proposed SyncSC reduce transmission overhead and achieve high-quality synchronous transmission of video and speech over the packet loss network.</description>

      <title>Learning Fine-Grained Grounded Citations for Attributed Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance on information-seeking tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with hallucinations. Attributed LLMs, which augment generated text with in-line citations, have shown potential in mitigating hallucinations and improving verifiability. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal citation quality due to their reliance on in-context learning. Furthermore, the practice of citing only coarse document identifiers makes it challenging for users to perform fine-grained verification. In this work, we introduce FRONT, a training framework designed to teach LLMs to generate Fine-Grained Grounded Citations. By grounding model outputs in fine-grained supporting quotes, these quotes guide the generation of grounded and consistent responses, not only improving citation quality but also facilitating fine-grained verification. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of FRONT in generating superior grounded responses and highly supportive citations. With LLaMA-2-7B, the framework significantly outperforms all the baselines, achieving an average of 14.21% improvement in citation quality across all datasets, even surpassing ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Sparse Neural Networks for Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for efficient feature selection. Leveraging the dynamic sparse training (DST) algorithms within SNNs has demonstrated promising feature selection capabilities while drastically reducing computational overheads. Despite these advancements, several critical aspects remain insufficiently explored for feature selection. Questions persist regarding the choice of the DST algorithm for network training, the choice of metric for ranking features/neurons, and the comparative performance of these methods across diverse datasets when compared to dense networks. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting a comprehensive systematic analysis of feature selection with sparse neural networks. Moreover, we introduce a novel metric considering sparse neural network characteristics, which is designed to quantify feature importance within the context of SNNs. Our findings show that feature selection with SNNs trained with DST algorithms can achieve, on average, more than $50\%$ memory and $55\%$ FLOPs reduction compared to the dense networks, while outperforming them in terms of the quality of the selected features. Our code and the supplementary material are available on GitHub (\url{https://github.com/zahraatashgahi/Neuron-Attribution}).</description>

      <title>Sampling for View Synthesis: From Local Light Field Fusion to Neural Radiance Fields and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing and rendering novel views of complex real-world scenes is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and vision, with applications in augmented and virtual reality, immersive experiences and 3D photography. The advent of deep learning has enabled revolutionary advances in this area, classically known as image-based rendering. However, previous approaches require intractably dense view sampling or provide little or no guidance for how users should sample views of a scene to reliably render high-quality novel views. Local light field fusion proposes an algorithm for practical view synthesis from an irregular grid of sampled views that first expands each sampled view into a local light field via a multiplane image scene representation, then renders novel views by blending adjacent local light fields. Crucially, we extend traditional plenoptic sampling theory to derive a bound that specifies precisely how densely users should sample views of a given scene when using our algorithm. We achieve the perceptual quality of Nyquist rate view sampling while using up to 4000x fewer views. Subsequent developments have led to new scene representations for deep learning with view synthesis, notably neural radiance fields, but the problem of sparse view synthesis from a small number of images has only grown in importance. We reprise some of the recent results on sparse and even single image view synthesis, while posing the question of whether prescriptive sampling guidelines are feasible for the new generation of image-based rendering algorithms.</description>

      <title>HiLo: A Learning Framework for Generalized Category Discovery Robust to Domain Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a challenging task in which, given a partially labelled dataset, models must categorize all unlabelled instances, regardless of whether they come from labelled categories or from new ones. In this paper, we challenge a remaining assumption in this task: that all images share the same domain. Specifically, we introduce a new task and method to handle GCD when the unlabelled data also contains images from different domains to the labelled set. Our proposed `HiLo' networks extract High-level semantic and Low-level domain features, before minimizing the mutual information between the representations. Our intuition is that the clusterings based on domain information and semantic information should be independent. We further extend our method with a specialized domain augmentation tailored for the GCD task, as well as a curriculum learning approach. Finally, we construct a benchmark from corrupted fine-grained datasets as well as a large-scale evaluation on DomainNet with real-world domain shifts, reimplementing a number of GCD baselines in this setting. We demonstrate that HiLo outperforms SoTA category discovery models by a large margin on all evaluations.</description>

      <title>Img-Diff: Contrastive Data Synthesis for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the proposed dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B, yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object removal" and conduct thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity, quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on synthesis of such contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/ImgDiff.</description>

      <title>Inference with the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm in the context of multiarmed bandit problems and discuss its implication in downstream inferential tasks. While inferential tasks become challenging when data is collected in a sequential manner, we argue that this problem can be alleviated when the sequential algorithm at hand satisfies certain stability property. This notion of stability is motivated from the seminal work of Lai and Wei (1982). Our first main result shows that such a stability property is always satisfied for the UCB algorithm, and as a result the sample means for each arm are asymptotically normal. Next, we examine the stability properties of the UCB algorithm when the number of arms $K$ is allowed to grow with the number of arm pulls $T$. We show that in such a case the arms are stable when $\frac{\log K}{\log T} \rightarrow 0$, and the number of near-optimal arms are large.</description>

      <title>Better Alignment with Instruction Back-and-Forth Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method, instruction back-and-forth translation, to construct high-quality synthetic data grounded in world knowledge for aligning large language models (LLMs). Given documents from a web corpus, we generate and curate synthetic instructions using the backtranslation approach proposed by Li et al.(2023a), and rewrite the responses to improve their quality further based on the initial documents. Fine-tuning with the resulting (backtranslated instruction, rewritten response) pairs yields higher win rates on AlpacaEval than using other common instruction datasets such as Humpback, ShareGPT, Open Orca, Alpaca-GPT4 and Self-instruct. We also demonstrate that rewriting the responses with an LLM outperforms direct distillation, and the two generated text distributions exhibit significant distinction in embedding space. Further analysis shows that our backtranslated instructions are of higher quality than other sources of synthetic instructions, while our responses are more diverse and complex than those obtained from distillation. Overall we find that instruction back-and-forth translation combines the best of both worlds -- making use of the information diversity and quantity found on the web, while ensuring the quality of the responses which is necessary for effective alignment.</description>

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized machine learning, yet their inner workings remain opaque to many. We present Transformer Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn about Transformers through the GPT-2 model. Our tool helps users understand complex Transformer concepts by integrating a model overview and enabling smooth transitions across abstraction levels of mathematical operations and model structures. It runs a live GPT-2 instance locally in the user's browser, empowering users to experiment with their own input and observe in real-time how the internal components and parameters of the Transformer work together to predict the next tokens. Our tool requires no installation or special hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern generative AI techniques. Our open-sourced tool is available at https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/. A video demo is available at https://youtu.be/ECR4oAwocjs.</description>

      <title>LogogramNLP: Comparing Visual and Textual Representations of Ancient Logographic Writing Systems for NLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard natural language processing (NLP) pipelines operate on symbolic representations of language, which typically consist of sequences of discrete tokens. However, creating an analogous representation for ancient logographic writing systems is an extremely labor intensive process that requires expert knowledge. At present, a large portion of logographic data persists in a purely visual form due to the absence of transcription -- this issue poses a bottleneck for researchers seeking to apply NLP toolkits to study ancient logographic languages: most of the relevant data are images of writing.
  This paper investigates whether direct processing of visual representations of language offers a potential solution. We introduce LogogramNLP, the first benchmark enabling NLP analysis of ancient logographic languages, featuring both transcribed and visual datasets for four writing systems along with annotations for tasks like classification, translation, and parsing. Our experiments compare systems that employ recent visual and text encoding strategies as backbones. The results demonstrate that visual representations outperform textual representations for some investigated tasks, suggesting that visual processing pipelines may unlock a large amount of cultural heritage data of logographic languages for NLP-based analyses.</description>

      <title>Puppet-Master: Scaling Interactive Video Generation as a Motion Prior for Part-Level Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Puppet-Master, an interactive video generative model that can serve as a motion prior for part-level dynamics. At test time, given a single image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories. Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark. See our project page for more results: vgg-puppetmaster.github.io.</description>

Abstract: The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</description>

Abstract: Causal abstraction provides a theoretical foundation for mechanistic interpretability, the field concerned with providing intelligible algorithms that are faithful simplifications of the known, but opaque low-level details of black box AI models. Our contributions are (1) generalizing the theory of causal abstraction from mechanism replacement (i.e., hard and soft interventions) to arbitrary mechanism transformation (i.e., functionals from old mechanisms to new mechanisms), (2) providing a flexible, yet precise formalization for the core concepts of modular features, polysemantic neurons, and graded faithfulness, and (3) unifying a variety of mechanistic interpretability methodologies in the common language of causal abstraction, namely activation and path patching, causal mediation analysis, causal scrubbing, causal tracing, circuit analysis, concept erasure, sparse autoencoders, differential binary masking, distributed alignment search, and activation steering.</description>

      <title>Dialectical Reconciliation via Structured Argumentative Dialogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework designed to extend model reconciliation approaches, commonly used in human-aware planning, for enhanced human-AI interaction. By adopting a structured argumentation-based dialogue paradigm, our framework enables dialectical reconciliation to address knowledge discrepancies between an explainer (AI agent) and an explainee (human user), where the goal is for the explainee to understand the explainer's decision. We formally describe the operational semantics of our proposed framework, providing theoretical guarantees. We then evaluate the framework's efficacy ``in the wild'' via computational and human-subject experiments. Our findings suggest that our framework offers a promising direction for fostering effective human-AI interactions in domains where explainability is important.</description>

      <title>Dissenting Explanations: Leveraging Disagreement to Reduce Model Overreliance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While explainability is a desirable characteristic of increasingly complex black-box models, modern explanation methods have been shown to be inconsistent and contradictory. The semantics of explanations is not always fully understood - to what extent do explanations "explain" a decision and to what extent do they merely advocate for a decision? Can we help humans gain insights from explanations accompanying correct predictions and not over-rely on incorrect predictions advocated for by explanations? With this perspective in mind, we introduce the notion of dissenting explanations: conflicting predictions with accompanying explanations. We first explore the advantage of dissenting explanations in the setting of model multiplicity, where multiple models with similar performance may have different predictions. In such cases, providing dissenting explanations could be done by invoking the explanations of disagreeing models. Through a pilot study, we demonstrate that dissenting explanations reduce overreliance on model predictions, without reducing overall accuracy. Motivated by the utility of dissenting explanations we present both global and local methods for their generation.</description>

      <title>From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. Our work presents a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs across a spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Specifically in this paper, we assess the capabilities of two VLMs, GPT-4V and LLaVA 1.6 34B, in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, manufacturability assessment, and engineering textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore VLMs' proficiency in handling complex design challenges but also identify their limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Uncertainty of the SHAP score in Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attribution scores reflect how important the feature values in an input entity are for the output of a machine learning model. One of the most popular attribution scores is the SHAP score, which is an instantiation of the general Shapley value used in coalition game theory. The definition of this score relies on a probability distribution on the entity population. Since the exact distribution is generally unknown, it needs to be assigned subjectively or be estimated from data, which may lead to misleading feature scores. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for reasoning on SHAP scores under unknown entity population distributions. In our framework, we consider an uncertainty region that contains the potential distributions, and the SHAP score of a feature becomes a function defined over this region. We study the basic problems of finding maxima and minima of this function, which allows us to determine tight ranges for the SHAP scores of all features. In particular, we pinpoint the complexity of these problems, and other related ones, showing them to be NP-complete. Finally, we present experiments on a real-world dataset, showing that our framework may contribute to a more robust feature scoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic circuits compute multilinear polynomials that represent multivariate probability distributions. They are tractable models that support efficient marginal inference. However, various polynomial semantics have been considered in the literature (e.g., network polynomials, likelihood polynomials, generating functions, and Fourier transforms). The relationships between circuit representations of these polynomial encodings of distributions is largely unknown. In this paper, we prove that for distributions over binary variables, each of these probabilistic circuit models is equivalent in the sense that any circuit for one of them can be transformed into a circuit for any of the others with only a polynomial increase in size. They are therefore all tractable for marginal inference on the same class of distributions. Finally, we explore the natural extension of one such polynomial semantics, called probabilistic generating circuits, to categorical random variables, and establish that inference becomes #P-hard.</description>

      <title>Empowering Large Language Model Agents through Action Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have recently garnered increasing interest yet they are limited in their ability to learn from trial and error, a key element of intelligent behavior. In this work, we argue that the capacity to learn new actions from experience is fundamental to the advancement of learning in LLM agents. While humans naturally expand their action spaces and develop skills through experiential learning, LLM agents typically operate within fixed action spaces, limiting their potential for growth. To address these challenges, our study explores open-action learning for language agents. We introduce a framework LearnAct with an iterative learning strategy to create and improve actions in the form of Python functions. In each iteration, LLM revises and updates the currently available actions based on the errors identified in unsuccessful training tasks, thereby enhancing action effectiveness. Our experimental evaluations across Robotic Planning and Alfworld environments reveal that after learning on a few training task instances, our approach to open-action learning markedly improves agent performance for the type of task (by 32 percent in AlfWorld compared to ReAct+Reflexion, for instance) highlighting the importance of experiential action learning in the development of more intelligent LLM agents.</description>

Abstract: This survey investigates the synergistic relationship between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which is crucial for advancing AI's capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and language processing. It aims to address gaps in current research by exploring areas such as KG Question Answering, ontology generation, KG validation, and the enhancement of KG accuracy and consistency through LLMs. The paper further examines the roles of LLMs in generating descriptive texts and natural language queries for KGs. Through a structured analysis that includes categorizing LLM-KG interactions, examining methodologies, and investigating collaborative uses and potential biases, this study seeks to provide new insights into the combined potential of LLMs and KGs. It highlights the importance of their interaction for improving AI applications and outlines future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Generative models such as large language models are extensively used as code copilots and for whole program generation. However, the programs they generate often have questionable correctness, authenticity and reliability in terms of integration as they might not follow the user requirements, provide incorrect and/or nonsensical outputs, or even contain semantic/syntactic errors - overall known as LLM hallucination. In this work, we present several types of code hallucination. We have generated such hallucinated code manually using large language models. We also present a technique - HallTrigger, in order to demonstrate efficient ways of generating arbitrary code hallucination. Our method leverages 3 different dynamic attributes of LLMs to craft prompts that can successfully trigger hallucinations from models without the need to access model architecture or parameters. Results from popular blackbox models suggest that HallTrigger is indeed effective and the pervasive LLM hallucination have sheer impact on software development.</description>

      <title>Assurance of AI Systems From a Dependability Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline the principles of classical assurance for computer-based systems that pose significant risks. We then consider application of these principles to systems that employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
  A key element in this "dependability" perspective is a requirement to have near-complete understanding of the behavior of critical components, and this is considered infeasible for AI and ML. Hence the dependability perspective aims to minimize trust in AI and ML elements by using "defense in depth" with a hierarchy of less complex systems, some of which may be highly assured conventionally engineered components, to "guard" them. This may be contrasted with the "trustworthy" perspective that seeks to apply assurance to the AI and ML elements themselves.
  In cyber-physical and many other systems, it is difficult to provide guards that do not depend on AI and ML to perceive their environment (e.g., other vehicles sharing the road with a self-driving car), so both perspectives are needed and there is a continuum or spectrum between them. We focus on architectures toward the dependability end of the continuum and invite others to consider additional points along the spectrum.
  For guards that require perception using AI and ML, we examine ways to minimize the trust placed in these elements; they include diversity, defense in depth, explanations, and micro-ODDs. We also examine methods to enforce acceptable behavior, given a model of the world. These include classical cyber-physical calculations and envelopes, and normative rules based on overarching principles, constitutions, ethics, or reputation. We apply our perspective to autonomous systems, AI systems for specific functions, generic AI such as Large Language Models, and to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and we propose current best practice and an agenda for research.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes an overview of the recent semi-supervised learning approaches and related works. Despite the remarkable success of neural networks in various applications, there exist a few formidable constraints, including the need for a large amount of labeled data. Therefore, semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which scarce labels and a larger amount of unlabeled data are utilized to train models (e.g., deep neural networks), is getting more important. Based on the key assumptions of semi-supervised learning, which are the manifold assumption, cluster assumption, and continuity assumption, the work reviews the recent semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to using deep neural networks in a semi-supervised learning setting are primarily discussed. In addition, the existing works are first classified based on the underlying idea and explained, then the holistic approaches that unify the aforementioned ideas are detailed.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Reinforcement Learning in Large Action Spaces: Structural Conditions and Sample-efficiency of Posterior Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Provably sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) with rich observations and function approximation has witnessed tremendous recent progress, particularly when the underlying function approximators are linear. In this linear regime, computationally and statistically efficient methods exist where the potentially infinite state and action spaces can be captured through a known feature embedding, with the sample complexity scaling with the (intrinsic) dimension of these features. When the action space is finite, significantly more sophisticated results allow non-linear function approximation under appropriate structural constraints on the underlying RL problem, permitting for instance, the learning of good features instead of assuming access to them. In this work, we present the first result for non-linear function approximation which holds for general action spaces under a linear embeddability condition, which generalizes all linear and finite action settings. We design a novel optimistic posterior sampling strategy, TS^3 for such problems, and show worst case sample complexity guarantees that scale with a rank parameter of the RL problem, the linear embedding dimension introduced in this work and standard measures of the function class complexity.</description>

      <title>Study of detecting behavioral signatures within DeepFake videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is strong interest in the generation of synthetic video imagery of people talking for various purposes, including entertainment, communication, training, and advertisement. With the development of deep fake generation models, synthetic video imagery will soon be visually indistinguishable to the naked eye from a naturally capture video. In addition, many methods are continuing to improve to avoid more careful, forensic visual analysis. Some deep fake videos are produced through the use of facial puppetry, which directly controls the head and face of the synthetic image through the movements of the actor, allow the actor to 'puppet' the image of another. In this paper, we address the question of whether one person's movements can be distinguished from the original speaker by controlling the visual appearance of the speaker but transferring the behavior signals from another source. We conduct a study by comparing synthetic imagery that: 1) originates from a different person speaking a different utterance, 2) originates from the same person speaking a different utterance, and 3) originates from a different person speaking the same utterance. Our study shows that synthetic videos in all three cases are seen as less real and less engaging than the original source video. Our results indicate that there could be a behavioral signature that is detectable from a person's movements that is separate from their visual appearance, and that this behavioral signature could be used to distinguish a deep fake from a properly captured video.</description>

Abstract: When training or evaluating deep learning models, two essential parts are picking the proper loss function and deciding on performance metrics. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most common loss functions and metrics used across many different types of deep learning tasks, from general tasks such as regression and classification to more specific tasks in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. We introduce the formula for each loss and metric, discuss their strengths and limitations, and describe how these methods can be applied to various problems within deep learning. We hope this work serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners in the field, helping them make informed decisions when selecting the most appropriate loss function and performance metrics for their deep learning projects.</description>

      <title>Effective Prompt Extraction from Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The text generated by large language models is commonly controlled by prompting, where a prompt prepended to a user's query guides the model's output. The prompts used by companies to guide their models are often treated as secrets, to be hidden from the user making the query. They have even been treated as commodities to be bought and sold on marketplaces. However, anecdotal reports have shown adversarial users employing prompt extraction attacks to recover these prompts. In this paper, we present a framework for systematically measuring the effectiveness of these attacks. In experiments with 3 different sources of prompts and 11 underlying large language models, we find that simple text-based attacks can in fact reveal prompts with high probability. Our framework determines with high precision whether an extracted prompt is the actual secret prompt, rather than a model hallucination. Prompt extraction from real systems such as Claude 3 and ChatGPT further suggest that system prompts can be revealed by an adversary despite existing defenses in place.</description>

      <title>SafeDreamer: Safe Reinforcement Learning with World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world applications is constrained by its failure to satisfy safety criteria. Existing Safe Reinforcement Learning (SafeRL) methods, which rely on cost functions to enforce safety, often fail to achieve zero-cost performance in complex scenarios, especially vision-only tasks. These limitations are primarily due to model inaccuracies and inadequate sample efficiency. The integration of the world model has proven effective in mitigating these shortcomings. In this work, we introduce SafeDreamer, a novel algorithm incorporating Lagrangian-based methods into world model planning processes within the superior Dreamer framework. Our method achieves nearly zero-cost performance on various tasks, spanning low-dimensional and vision-only input, within the Safety-Gymnasium benchmark, showcasing its efficacy in balancing performance and safety in RL tasks.

      <title>Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fact checking can be an effective strategy against misinformation, but its implementation at scale is impeded by the overwhelming volume of information online. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) language models have shown impressive ability in fact-checking tasks, but how humans interact with fact-checking information provided by these models is unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of fact-checking information generated by a popular large language model (LLM) on belief in, and sharing intent of, political news headlines in a preregistered randomized control experiment. Although the LLM accurately identifies most false headlines (90%), we find that this information does not significantly improve participants' ability to discern headline accuracy or share accurate news. In contrast, viewing human-generated fact checks enhances discernment in both cases. Subsequent analysis reveals that the AI fact-checker is harmful in specific cases: it decreases beliefs in true headlines that it mislabels as false and increases beliefs in false headlines that it is unsure about. On the positive side, AI fact-checking information increases the sharing intent for correctly labeled true headlines. When participants are given the option to view LLM fact checks and choose to do so, they are significantly more likely to share both true and false news but only more likely to believe false headlines. Our findings highlight an important source of potential harm stemming from AI applications and underscore the critical need for policies to prevent or mitigate such unintended consequences.</description>

      <title>CALM : A Multi-task Benchmark for Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) become increasingly powerful and widely used, it is important to quantify them for sociodemographic bias with potential for harm. Prior measures of bias are sensitive to perturbations in the templates designed to compare performance across social groups, due to factors such as low diversity or limited number of templates. Also, most previous work considers only one NLP task. We introduce Comprehensive Assessment of Language Models (CALM) for robust measurement of two types of universally relevant sociodemographic bias, gender and race. CALM integrates sixteen datasets for question-answering, sentiment analysis and natural language inference. Examples from each dataset are filtered to produce 224 templates with high diversity (e.g., length, vocabulary). We assemble 50 highly frequent person names for each of seven distinct demographic groups to generate 78,400 prompts covering the three NLP tasks. Our empirical evaluation shows that CALM bias scores are more robust and far less sensitive than previous bias measurements to perturbations in the templates, such as synonym substitution, or to random subset selection of templates. We apply CALM to 20 large language models, and find that for 2 language model series, larger parameter models tend to be more biased than smaller ones. The T0 series is the least biased model families, of the 20 LLMs investigated here. The code is available at https://github.com/vipulgupta1011/CALM.</description>

      <title>Conformal Temporal Logic Planning using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses planning problems for mobile robots. We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners because of the NL nature of atomic predicates. To address it, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions based on these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. Finally, we provide comparative experiments demonstrating that HERACLEs outperforms LLM-based planners that require the mission to be defined solely using NL. Additionally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches.</description>

      <title>State Representations as Incentives for Reinforcement Learning Agents: A Sim2Real Analysis on Robotic Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choosing an appropriate representation of the environment for the underlying decision-making process of the reinforcement learning agent is not always straightforward. The state representation should be inclusive enough to allow the agent to informatively decide on its actions and disentangled enough to simplify policy training and the corresponding sim2real transfer. Given this outlook, this work examines the effect of various representations in incentivizing the agent to solve a specific robotic task: antipodal and planar object grasping. A continuum of state representations is defined, starting from hand-crafted numerical states to encoded image-based representations, with decreasing levels of induced task-specific knowledge. The effects of each representation on the ability of the agent to solve the task in simulation and the transferability of the learned policy to the real robot are examined and compared against a model-based approach with complete system knowledge. The results show that reinforcement learning agents using numerical states can perform on par with non-learning baselines. Furthermore, we find that agents using image-based representations from pre-trained environment embedding vectors perform better than end-to-end trained agents, and hypothesize that separation of representation learning from reinforcement learning can benefit sim2real transfer. Finally, we conclude that incentivizing the state representation with task-specific knowledge facilitates faster convergence for agent training and increases success rates in sim2real robot control.</description>

      <title>An In-Context Learning Agent for Formal Theorem-Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04353v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-context learning agent for formal theorem-proving in environments like Lean and Coq. Current state-of-the-art models for the problem are finetuned on environment-specific proof data. By contrast, our approach, called COPRA, repeatedly asks a high-capacity, general-purpose large language model (GPT-4) to propose tactic applications from within a stateful backtracking search. Proposed tactics are executed in the underlying proof environment. Feedback from the execution is used to build the prompt for the next model query, along with selected information from the search history and lemmas retrieved from an external database. We evaluate our implementation of COPRA on the miniF2F benchmark for Lean and a set of Coq tasks from the CompCert project. On these benchmarks, COPRA significantly outperforms few-shot invocations of GPT-4. It also compares favorably against finetuning-based approaches, outperforming ReProver, a state-of-the-art finetuned approach for Lean, in terms of the pass@1 metric. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/trishullab/copra.</description>

      <title>Functional Overlap Reranking for Neural Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have ushered in a new era in code generation advancements. However, selecting the best code solutions from all possible CodeLLM outputs remains a challenge. Previous methods often overlooked the intricate functional similarities and interactions between solution clusters. We introduce SRank, a novel reranking strategy for selecting the best solutions from code generation, focusing on modeling the relationships between clusters of solutions. By quantifying the functional overlap between solution clusters, our approach provides a better ranking strategy for code solutions. Empirical results show that our method achieves remarkable results on the pass@1 score. For instance, on the Human-Eval benchmark, we achieve 69.66% in pass@1 with Codex002, 75.31% with WizardCoder, 53.99% with StarCoder, and 60.55% with CodeGen, surpassing state-of-the-art code generation reranking methods such as CodeT and Coder-Reviewer on the same CodeLLM by a significant margin (approximately 6.1% improvement on average). Even in scenarios with a limited number of sampled solutions and test cases, our approach demonstrates robustness and superiority, marking a new benchmark in code generation reranking. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/SRank-CodeRanker.</description>

      <title>LLMs Learn Task Heuristics from Demonstrations: A Heuristic-Driven Prompting Strategy for Document-Level Event Argument Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate in-context learning (ICL) in document-level event argument extraction (EAE) to alleviate the dependency on large-scale labeled data for this task. We introduce the Heuristic-Driven Link-of-Analogy (HD-LoA) prompting to address the challenge of example selection and to develop a prompting strategy tailored for EAE. Specifically, we hypothesize and validate that LLMs learn task-specific heuristics from demonstrations via ICL. Building upon this hypothesis, we introduce an explicit heuristic-driven demonstration construction approach, which transforms the haphazard example selection process into a methodical method that emphasizes task heuristics. Additionally, inspired by the analogical reasoning of human, we propose the link-of-analogy prompting, which enables LLMs to process new situations by drawing analogies to known situations, enhancing their performance on unseen classes beyond limited ICL examples. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing prompting methods and few-shot supervised learning methods on document-level EAE datasets. Additionally, the HD-LoA prompting shows effectiveness in diverse tasks like sentiment analysis and natural language inference, demonstrating its broad adaptability.</description>

      <title>MAP's not dead yet: Uncovering true language model modes by conditioning away degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been widely observed that exact or approximate MAP (mode-seeking) decoding from natural language generation (NLG) models consistently leads to degenerate outputs (Holtzman et al., 2019; Stahlberg and Byrne, 2019). Prior work has attributed this behavior to either a fundamental and unavoidable inadequacy of modes in probabilistic models or weaknesses in language modeling. Contrastingly, we argue that degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of any modeling error, due to contamination of the training data. Specifically, we argue that mixing even a tiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population text distribution can cause the data distribution's mode to become degenerate. We therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's true conditional distribution where the conditioning variable explicitly avoids specific degenerate behavior. Using exact search, we empirically verify that the length-conditional modes of machine translation models and language models are indeed more fluent and topical than their unconditional modes. For the first time, we also share many examples of exact modal sequences from these models, and from several variants of the LLaMA-7B model. Notably, we observe that various kinds of degenerate modes persist, even at the scale of LLaMA-7B. Although we cannot tractably address these degeneracies with exact search, we perform a classifier-based approximate search on LLaMA-7B, a model which was not trained for instruction following, and find that we are able to elicit reasonable outputs without any finetuning.</description>

      <title>SPOC: Imitating Shortest Paths in Simulation Enables Effective Navigation and Manipulation in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with dense rewards and imitation learning (IL) with human-generated trajectories are the most widely used approaches for training modern embodied agents. RL requires extensive reward shaping and auxiliary losses and is often too slow and ineffective for long-horizon tasks. While IL with human supervision is effective, collecting human trajectories at scale is extremely expensive. In this work, we show that imitating shortest-path planners in simulation produces agents that, given a language instruction, can proficiently navigate, explore, and manipulate objects in both simulation and in the real world using only RGB sensors (no depth map or GPS coordinates). This surprising result is enabled by our end-to-end, transformer-based, SPOC architecture, powerful visual encoders paired with extensive image augmentation, and the dramatic scale and diversity of our training data: millions of frames of shortest-path-expert trajectories collected inside approximately 200,000 procedurally generated houses containing 40,000 unique 3D assets. Our models, data, training code, and newly proposed 10-task benchmarking suite CHORES are available in https://spoc-robot.github.io.</description>

      <title>Imitate the Good and Avoid the Bad: An Incremental Approach to Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular framework for enforcing safe actions in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is Constrained RL, where trajectory based constraints on expected cost (or other cost measures) are employed to enforce safety and more importantly these constraints are enforced while maximizing expected reward. Most recent approaches for solving Constrained RL convert the trajectory based cost constraint into a surrogate problem that can be solved using minor modifications to RL methods. A key drawback with such approaches is an over or underestimation of the cost constraint at each state. Therefore, we provide an approach that does not modify the trajectory based cost constraint and instead imitates ``good'' trajectories and avoids ``bad'' trajectories generated from incrementally improving policies. We employ an oracle that utilizes a reward threshold (which is varied with learning) and the overall cost constraint to label trajectories as ``good'' or ``bad''. A key advantage of our approach is that we are able to work from any starting policy or set of trajectories and improve on it. In an exhaustive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is able to outperform top benchmark approaches for solving Constrained RL problems, with respect to expected cost, CVaR cost, or even unknown cost constraints.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Thought Process for Private Data Handling in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge. However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35% additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for the question-answering task.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Aware Sign Language Translation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major impediment to the advancement of sign language translation (SLT) is data scarcity. Much of the sign language data currently available on the web cannot be used for training supervised models due to the lack of aligned captions. Furthermore, scaling SLT using large-scale web-scraped datasets bears privacy risks due to the presence of biometric information, which the responsible development of SLT technologies should account for. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework for privacy-aware SLT at scale that addresses both of these issues. We introduce SSVP-SLT, which leverages self-supervised video pretraining on anonymized and unannotated videos, followed by supervised SLT finetuning on a curated parallel dataset. SSVP-SLT achieves state-of-the-art finetuned and zero-shot gloss-free SLT performance on the How2Sign dataset, outperforming the strongest respective baselines by over 3 BLEU-4. Based on controlled experiments, we further discuss the advantages and limitations of self-supervised pretraining and anonymization via facial obfuscation for SLT.</description>

      <title>Causal Equal Protection as Algorithmic Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining the philosophical literature on statistical evidence and the interdisciplinary literature on algorithmic fairness, we revisit recent objections against classification parity in light of causal analyses of algorithmic fairness and the distinction between predictive and diagnostic evidence. We focus on trial proceedings as a black-box classification algorithm in which defendants are sorted into two groups by convicting or acquitting them. We defend a novel principle, causal equal protection, that combines classification parity with the causal approach. In the do-calculus, causal equal protection requires that individuals should not be subject to uneven risks of classification error because of their protected or socially salient characteristics. The explicit use of protected characteristics, however, may be required if it equalizes these risks.</description>

      <title>Read and Think: An Efficient Step-wise Multimodal Language Model for Document Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the contents of multimodal documents is essential to accurately extract relevant evidence and use it for reasoning. Existing document understanding models tend to generate answers with a single word or phrase directly, ignoring the source document's evidence and lacking interpretability. In this work, we address the lack of step-wise capabilities through data augmentation and extension. Specifically, We use Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which have strong visual understanding and reasoning abilities, as data generators to generate step-wise question-and-answer pairs for document images and use a high-performance LLM as the error detector to filter out noisy data. This step-wise data generation pipeline is implemented using both template-based and few-shot methods. We then use the generated high-quality data to train a humanized document understanding and reasoning model, specifically designed to solve complex questions that require reasoning or multi-hop question answering, dubbed DocAssistant. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and application value of step-wise generation, showing a 5 improvement on InfoVQA with complex layouts and a 7 improvement on ChartQA with complex reasoning, compared to directly generated answers. We hope our work highlights the potential of synthetic data and encourages further exploration of multi-modal document reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05530v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (&gt;99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.</description>

      <title>P2LHAP:Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition, segmentation and forecast through Patch-to-Label Seq2Seq Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional deep learning methods struggle to simultaneously segment, recognize, and forecast human activities from sensor data. This limits their usefulness in many fields such as healthcare and assisted living, where real-time understanding of ongoing and upcoming activities is crucial. This paper introduces P2LHAP, a novel Patch-to-Label Seq2Seq framework that tackles all three tasks in a efficient single-task model. P2LHAP divides sensor data streams into a sequence of "patches", served as input tokens, and outputs a sequence of patch-level activity labels including the predicted future activities. A unique smoothing technique based on surrounding patch labels, is proposed to identify activity boundaries accurately. Additionally, P2LHAP learns patch-level representation by sensor signal channel-independent Transformer encoders and decoders. All channels share embedding and Transformer weights across all sequences. Evaluated on three public datasets, P2LHAP significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in all three tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Duwak: Dual Watermarks in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLM) are increasingly used for text generation tasks, it is critical to audit their usages, govern their applications, and mitigate their potential harms. Existing watermark techniques are shown effective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable patterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics. However, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of tokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against post-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to fundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding dual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling schemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain tokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which minimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically explain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate Duwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four state-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results show that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at the lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than existing approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.</description>

      <title>STaR-GATE: Teaching Language Models to Ask Clarifying Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When prompting language models to complete a task, users often leave important aspects unsaid. While asking questions could resolve this ambiguity (GATE; Li et al., 2023), models often struggle to ask good questions. We explore a language model's ability to self-improve (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) by rewarding the model for generating useful questions-a simple method we dub STaR-GATE. We generate a synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts to simulate conversations between a pretrained language model-the Questioner-and a Roleplayer whose preferences are unknown to the Questioner. By asking questions, the Questioner elicits preferences from the Roleplayer. The Questioner is iteratively finetuned on questions that increase the probability of high-quality responses to the task, which are generated by an Oracle with access to the Roleplayer's latent preferences. After two iterations of self-improvement, the Questioner asks better questions, allowing it to generate responses that are preferred over responses from the initial model on 72% of tasks. Our results indicate that teaching a language model to ask better questions leads to better personalized responses.</description>

      <title>MANGO: A Benchmark for Evaluating Mapping and Navigation Abilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have recently achieved astonishing performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose MANGO, a benchmark to evaluate their capabilities to perform text-based mapping and navigation. Our benchmark includes 53 mazes taken from a suite of textgames: each maze is paired with a walkthrough that visits every location but does not cover all possible paths. The task is question-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough and answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as "How should you go to Attic from West of House?" and "Where are we if we go north and east from Cellar?". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that even GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them. Further, our experiments suggest that a strong mapping and navigation ability would benefit large language models in performing relevant downstream tasks, such as playing textgames. Our MANGO benchmark will facilitate future research on methods that improve the mapping and navigation capabilities of language models. We host our leaderboard, data, code, and evaluation program at https://mango.ttic.edu and https://github.com/oaklight/mango/.</description>

      <title>HARMamba: Efficient and Lightweight Wearable Sensor Human Activity Recognition Based on Bidirectional Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a critical research domain in activity perception. However, achieving high efficiency and long sequence recognition remains a challenge. Despite the extensive investigation of temporal deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, their extensive parameters often pose significant computational and memory constraints, rendering them less suitable for resource-constrained mobile health applications. This study introduces HARMamba, an innovative light-weight and versatile HAR architecture that combines selective bidirectional State Spaces Model and hardware-aware design. To optimize real-time resource consumption in practical scenarios, HARMamba employs linear recursive mechanisms and parameter discretization, allowing it to selectively focus on relevant input sequences while efficiently fusing scan and recompute operations. The model employs independent channels to process sensor data streams, dividing each channel into patches and appending classification tokens to the end of the sequence. It utilizes position embedding to represent the sequence order. The patch sequence is subsequently processed by HARMamba Block, and the classification head finally outputs the activity category. The HARMamba Block serves as the fundamental component of the HARMamba architecture, enabling the effective capture of more discriminative activity sequence features. HARMamba outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks, delivering comparable or better accuracy with significantly reducing computational and memory demands. It's effectiveness has been extensively validated on 4 publically available datasets namely PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB SHAR and UCI. The F1 scores of HARMamba on the four datasets are 99.74%, 99.20%, 88.23% and 97.01%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Laying Anchors: Semantically Priming Numerals in Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-the-shelf pre-trained language models have become the de facto standard in NLP pipelines for a multitude of downstream tasks. However, the inability of these models to properly encode numerals limits their performance on tasks requiring numeric comprehension. We introduce strategies to semantically prime numerals in any corpus by generating anchors governed by the distribution of numerals in said corpus, thereby enabling mathematically grounded representations of these numeral tokens. We establish the superiority of our proposed techniques through evaluation on a range of numeracy tasks for both in-domain (seen) and out-domain (unseen) numerals. Further, we expand our empirical evaluations to numerals ranging from 1 to 10 billion, a significantly broader range compared to previous studies of the same nature, and we demonstrate significant improvements in the mathematical grounding of our learned embeddings.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban air mobility is an innovative mode of transportation in which electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles operate between nodes called vertiports. We outline a self-organized vertiport arrival system based on deep reinforcement learning. The airspace around the vertiport is assumed to be circular, and the vehicles can freely operate inside. Each aircraft is considered an individual agent and follows a shared policy, resulting in decentralized actions that are based on local information. We investigate the development of the reinforcement learning policy during training and illustrate how the algorithm moves from suboptimal local holding patterns to a safe and efficient final policy. The latter is validated in simulation-based scenarios, including robustness analyses against sensor noise and a changing distribution of inbound traffic. Lastly, we deploy the final policy on small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles to showcase its real-world usability.</description>

Abstract: Understanding bidding behavior in multi-unit auctions remains an ongoing challenge for researchers. Despite their widespread use, theoretical insights into the bidding behavior, revenue ranking, and efficiency of commonly used multi-unit auctions are limited. This paper utilizes artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, as a model free learning approach to simulate bidding in three prominent multi-unit auctions employed in practice. We introduce six algorithms that are suitable for learning and bidding in multi-unit auctions and compare them using an illustrative example. This paper underscores the significance of using artificial intelligence in auction design, particularly in enhancing the design of multi-unit auctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a novel quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address complex optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating complex optimization landscapes and providing valuable insights into its performance. The simple test of HEO in Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential weakness in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>DREAM: Combating Concept Drift with Explanatory Detection and Adaptation in Malware Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based malware classifiers face significant challenges due to concept drift. The rapid evolution of malware, especially with new families, can depress classification accuracy to near-random levels. Previous research has primarily focused on detecting drift samples, relying on expert-led analysis and labeling for model retraining. However, these methods often lack a comprehensive understanding of malware concepts and provide limited guidance for effective drift adaptation, leading to unstable detection performance and high human labeling costs. To address these limitations, we introduce DREAM, a novel system designed to surpass the capabilities of existing drift detectors and to establish an explanatory drift adaptation process. DREAM enhances drift detection through model sensitivity and data autonomy. The detector, trained in a semi-supervised approach, proactively captures malware behavior concepts through classifier feedback. During testing, it utilizes samples generated by the detector itself, eliminating reliance on extensive training data. For drift adaptation, DREAM enlarges human intervention, enabling revisions of malware labels and concept explanations embedded within the detector's latent space. To ensure a comprehensive response to concept drift, it facilitates a coordinated update process for both the classifier and the detector. Our evaluation shows that DREAM can effectively improve the drift detection accuracy and reduce the expert analysis effort in adaptation across different malware datasets and classifiers.</description>

      <title>LLM Discussion: Enhancing the Creativity of Large Language Models via Discussion Framework and Role-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional proficiency in natural language processing but often fall short of generating creative and original responses to open-ended questions. To enhance LLM creativity, our key insight is to emulate the human process of inducing collective creativity through engaging discussions with participants from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both LLM evaluation and human study. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms single-LLM approaches and existing multi-LLM frameworks across various creativity metrics.

      <description>arXiv:2405.15682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How has generative AI impacted the experiences of college students? We study the influence of AI on the study habits, class choices, and career prospects of Harvard undergraduates (n=326), finding that almost 90% of students use generative AI. For roughly 25% of these students, AI has begun to substitute for attending office hours and completing required readings. Half of students are concerned that AI will negatively impact their job prospects, and over half of students wish that Harvard had more classes on the future impacts of AI. We also investigate students' outlook on the broader social implications of AI, finding that half of students are worried that AI will increase economic inequality, and 40% believe that extinction risk from AI should be treated as a global priority with the same urgency as pandemics and nuclear war. Around half of students who have taken a class on AI expect AI to exceed human capabilities on almost all tasks within 30 years. We make some recommendations to the Harvard community in light of these results.</description>

      <title>Long and Short Guidance in Score identity Distillation for One-Step Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have shown the capacity to generate photorealistic images consistent with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG) to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss, utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and an FID of 9.56 with a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2. Our code and distilled one-step text-to-image generators are available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from intractable distributions over discrete sets without relying on corresponding training data is a central problem in a wide range of fields, including Combinatorial Optimization. Currently, popular deep learning-based approaches rely primarily on generative models that yield exact sample likelihoods. This work introduces a method that lifts this restriction and opens the possibility to employ highly expressive latent variable models like diffusion models. Our approach is conceptually based on a loss that upper bounds the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and evades the requirement of exact sample likelihoods. We experimentally validate our approach in data-free Combinatorial Optimization and demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Recommendations: From Backward to Forward AI Support of Pilots' Decision-Making Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI is anticipated to enhance human decision-making in high-stakes domains like aviation, but adoption is often hindered by challenges such as inappropriate reliance and poor alignment with users' decision-making. Recent research suggests that a core underlying issue is the recommendation-centric design of many AI systems, i.e., they give end-to-end recommendations and ignore the rest of the decision-making process. Alternative support paradigms are rare, and it remains unclear how the few that do exist compare to recommendation-centric support. In this work, we aimed to empirically compare recommendation-centric support to an alternative paradigm, continuous support, in the context of diversions in aviation. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 32 professional pilots in a realistic setting. To ensure the quality of our study scenarios, we conducted a focus group with four additional pilots prior to the study. We found that continuous support can support pilots' decision-making in a forward direction, allowing them to think more beyond the limits of the system and make faster decisions when combined with recommendations, though the forward support can be disrupted. Participants' statements further suggest a shift in design goal away from providing recommendations, to supporting quick information gathering. Our results show ways to design more helpful and effective AI decision support that goes beyond end-to-end recommendations.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated promising performance across various tasks. However, it also introduces redundant structures, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some recognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across different modules, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored. In this work, we investigate the varying redundancy across different modules within Transformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a similarity-based metric. This metric operates on the premise that redundant structures produce outputs highly similar to their inputs. Surprisingly, while attention layers are essential for transformers and distinguish them from other mainstream architectures, we found that a large proportion of attention layers exhibit excessively high similarity and can be safely pruned without degrading performance, leading to reduced memory and computation costs. Additionally, we further propose a method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, achieving improved performance and dropping ratios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, e.g., Llama-3-70B maintains comparable performance even after pruning half of the attention layers. Our findings provide valuable insights for future network architecture design. The code is released at: \url{https://github.com/Shwai-He/LLM-Drop}.</description>

      <title>Data Imputation using Large Language Model to Accelerate Recommendation System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of sparse and missing data in recommendation systems, a significant hurdle in the age of big data. Traditional imputation methods struggle to capture complex relationships within the data. We propose a novel approach that fine-tune Large Language Model (LLM) and use it impute missing data for recommendation systems. LLM which is trained on vast amounts of text, is able to understand complex relationship among data and intelligently fill in missing information. This enriched data is then used by the recommendation system to generate more accurate and personalized suggestions, ultimately enhancing the user experience. We evaluate our LLM-based imputation method across various tasks within the recommendation system domain, including single classification, multi-classification, and regression compared to traditional data imputation methods. By demonstrating the superiority of LLM imputation over traditional methods, we establish its potential for improving recommendation system performance.</description>

      <title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.</description>

      <title>Two new feature selection methods based on learn-heuristic techniques for breast cancer prediction: A comprehensive analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is not preventable because of its unknown causes. However, its early diagnosis increases patients' recovery chances. Machine learning (ML) can be utilized to improve treatment outcomes in healthcare operations while diminishing costs and time. In this research, we suggest two novel feature selection (FS) methods based upon an imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and a bat algorithm (BA) and their combination with ML algorithms. This study aims to enhance diagnostic models' efficiency and present a comprehensive analysis to help clinical physicians make much more precise and reliable decisions than before. K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, linear discriminant analysis, random forest, logistic regression, and artificial neural network are some of the methods employed. This paper applied a distinctive integration of evaluation measures and ML algorithms using the wrapper feature selection based on ICA (WFSIC) and BA (WFSB) separately. We compared two proposed approaches for the performance of the classifiers. Also, we compared our best diagnostic model with previous works reported in the literature survey. Experimentations were performed on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Results reveal that the proposed framework that uses the BA with an accuracy of 99.12\%, surpasses the framework using the ICA and most previous works. Additionally, the RF classifier in the approach of FS based on BA emerges as the best model and outperforms others regarding its criteria. Besides, the results illustrate the role of our techniques in reducing the dataset dimensions up to 90\% and increasing the performance of diagnostic models by over 99\%. Moreover, the result demonstrates that there are more critical features than the optimum dataset obtained by proposed FS approaches that have been selected by most ML models.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Feature Backbone Fine-tuning for Remote Sensing Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous methods have achieved impressive performance in remote sensing object detection, relying on convolution or transformer architectures. Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. For the remote sensing domain, a common practice among current detectors is to initialize the backbone with pre-training on ImageNet consisting of natural scenes. Fine-tuning the backbone is then typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. However, this could hinder the extraction of basic visual features in long-term training, thus restricting performance improvement. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel method named DBF (Dynamic Backbone Freezing) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection. Our method aims to handle the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to dynamically manage the update of backbone features during training. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that our approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing computational costs. Our method can be seamlessly adopted without additional effort due to its straightforward design.</description>

      <title>AIDE: Antithetical, Intent-based, and Diverse Example-Based Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a black-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples. Existing approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a homogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning from different angles.
  In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e., contrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models. AIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a correct, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction. For each intent, AIDE selects an appropriate set of influential training samples that support or oppose the prediction either directly or by contrast. To provide a succinct summary, AIDE uses diversity-aware sampling to avoid redundancy and increase coverage of the training data.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE on image and text classification tasks, in three ways: quantitatively, assessing correctness and continuity; qualitatively, comparing anecdotal evidence from AIDE and other example-based approaches; and via a user study, evaluating multiple aspects of AIDE. The results show that AIDE addresses the limitations of existing methods and exhibits desirable traits for an explainability method.</description>

      <title>An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theory: Foundations for Parallelism in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</description>

      <title>Automatic Generation of Behavioral Test Cases For Natural Language Processing Using Clustering and Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in behavioral testing for natural language processing (NLP) models, such as Checklist, is inspired by related paradigms in software engineering testing. They allow evaluation of general linguistic capabilities and domain understanding, hence can help evaluate conceptual soundness and identify model weaknesses. However, a major challenge is the creation of test cases. The current packages rely on semi-automated approach using manual development which requires domain expertise and can be time consuming. This paper introduces an automated approach to develop test cases by exploiting the power of large language models and statistical techniques. It clusters the text representations to carefully construct meaningful groups and then apply prompting techniques to automatically generate Minimal Functionality Tests (MFT). The well-known Amazon Reviews corpus is used to demonstrate our approach. We analyze the behavioral test profiles across four different classification algorithms and discuss the limitations and strengths of those models.</description>

      <title>Partial-differential-algebraic equations of nonlinear dynamics by Physics-Informed Neural-Network: (I) Operator splitting and framework assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several forms for constructing novel physics-informed neural-networks (PINN) for the solution of partial-differential-algebraic equations based on derivative operator splitting are proposed, using the nonlinear Kirchhoff rod as a prototype for demonstration. The open-source DeepXDE is likely the most well documented framework with many examples. Yet, we encountered some pathological problems and proposed novel methods to resolve them. Among these novel methods are the PDE forms, which evolve from the lower-level form with fewer unknown dependent variables to higher-level form with more dependent variables, in addition to those from lower-level forms. Traditionally, the highest-level form, the balance-of-momenta form, is the starting point for (hand) deriving the lowest-level form through a tedious (and error prone) process of successive substitutions. The next step in a finite element method is to discretize the lowest-level form upon forming a weak form and linearization with appropriate interpolation functions, followed by their implementation in a code and testing. The time-consuming tedium in all of these steps could be bypassed by applying the proposed novel PINN directly to the highest-level form. We developed a script based on JAX. While our JAX script did not show the pathological problems of DDE-T (DDE with TensorFlow backend), it is slower than DDE-T. That DDE-T itself being more efficient in higher-level form than in lower-level form makes working directly with higher-level form even more attractive in addition to the advantages mentioned further above. Since coming up with an appropriate learning-rate schedule for a good solution is more art than science, we systematically codified in detail our experience running optimization through a normalization/standardization of the network-training process so readers can reproduce our results.</description>

      <title>Environment Complexity and Nash Equilibria in a Sequential Social Dilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods, while effective in zero-sum or positive-sum games, often yield suboptimal outcomes in general-sum games where cooperation is essential for achieving globally optimal outcomes. Matrix game social dilemmas, which abstract key aspects of general-sum interactions, such as cooperation, risk, and trust, fail to model the temporal and spatial dynamics characteristic of real-world scenarios. In response, our study extends matrix game social dilemmas into more complex, higher-dimensional MARL environments. We adapt a gridworld implementation of the Stag Hunt dilemma to more closely match the decision-space of a one-shot matrix game while also introducing variable environment complexity. Our findings indicate that as complexity increases, MARL agents trained in these environments converge to suboptimal strategies, consistent with the risk-dominant Nash equilibria strategies found in matrix games. Our work highlights the impact of environment complexity on achieving optimal outcomes in higher-dimensional game-theoretic MARL environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Evaluators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based evaluation is at the heart of successful model development -- as a reward model for training, and as a replacement for human evaluation. To train such evaluators, the standard approach is to collect a large amount of human preference judgments over model responses, which is costly and the data becomes stale as models improve. In this work, we present an approach that aims to im-prove evaluators without human annotations, using synthetic training data only. Starting from unlabeled instructions, our iterative self-improvement scheme generates contrasting model outputs and trains an LLM-as-a-Judge to produce reasoning traces and final judgments, repeating this training at each new iteration using the improved predictions. Without any labeled preference data, our Self-Taught Evaluator can improve a strong LLM (Llama3-70B-Instruct) from 75.4 to 88.3 (88.7 with majority vote) on RewardBench. This outperforms commonly used LLM judges such as GPT-4 and matches the performance of the top-performing reward models trained with labeled examples.</description>

      <title>KOI: Accelerating Online Imitation Learning via Hybrid Key-state Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Imitation Learning methods struggle with the gap between extensive online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, which hinder efficient exploration due to inaccurate task-aware reward estimation. Inspired by the findings from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could facilitate cognitive processing for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware imitation rewards for efficient online exploration by decomposing the target task into the objectives of "what to do" and the mechanisms of "how to do". In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for task-aware reward estimation. Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to segment the expert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives of "what to do". Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow is employed to capture motion key states to understand the process of "how to do". By integrating a thorough grasp of both semantic and motion key states, we refine the trajectory-matching reward computation, encouraging task-aware exploration for efficient online imitation learning. Our experiment results prove that our method is more sample efficient in the Meta-World and LIBERO environments. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability of our KOI method.</description>

      <title>The Use of Large Language Models (LLM) for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in Cybercrime Forums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be used to analyze cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data from cybercrime forums, which contain extensive information and key discussions about emerging cyber threats. However, to date, the level of accuracy and efficiency of LLMs for such critical tasks has yet to be thoroughly evaluated. Hence, this study assesses the accuracy of an LLM system built on the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model [7] to extract CTI information. To do so, a random sample of 500 daily conversations from three cybercrime forums, XSS, Exploit_in, and RAMP, was extracted, and the LLM system was instructed to summarize the conversations and code 10 key CTI variables, such as whether a large organization and/or a critical infrastructure is being targeted. Then, two coders reviewed each conversation and evaluated whether the information extracted by the LLM was accurate. The LLM system performed strikingly well, with an average accuracy score of 98%. Various ways to enhance the model were uncovered, such as the need to help the LLM distinguish between stories and past events, as well as being careful with verb tenses in prompts. Nevertheless, the results of this study highlight the efficiency and relevance of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the extent of similarities in software failures across industries using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of software development necessitates enhanced safety measures. Extracting information about software failures from companies is becoming increasingly more available through news articles.
  This research utilizes the Failure Analysis Investigation with LLMs (FAIL) model to extract industry-specific information. Although the FAIL model's database is rich in information, it could benefit from further categorization and industry-specific insights to further assist software engineers.
  In previous work news articles were collected from reputable sources and categorized by incidents inside a database. Prompt engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) were then applied to extract relevant information regarding the software failure. This research extends these methods by categorizing articles into specific domains and types of software failures. The results are visually represented through graphs.
  The analysis shows that throughout the database some software failures occur significantly more often in specific industries. This categorization provides a valuable resource for software engineers and companies to identify and address common failures.
  This research highlights the synergy between software engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the analysis of software failures. By transforming data from the database into an industry specific model, we provide a valuable resource that can be used to identify common vulnerabilities, predict potential risks, and implement proactive measures for preventing software failures. Leveraging the power of the current FAIL database and data visualization, we aim to provide an avenue for safer and more secure software in the future.</description>
