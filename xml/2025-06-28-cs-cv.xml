      <title>OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

      <title>StereoDiff: Stereo-Diffusion Synergy for Video Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent video depth estimation methods achieve great performance by following the paradigm of image depth estimation, i.e., typically fine-tuning pre-trained video diffusion models with massive data. However, we argue that video depth estimation is not a naive extension of image depth estimation. The temporal consistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are fundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically backgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all frames, which provides much stronger global 3D cues. While the consistency for dynamic regions still should be learned from large-scale video depth data to ensure smooth transitions, due to the violation of triangulation constraints. Based on these insights, we introduce StereoDiff, a two-stage video depth estimator that synergizes stereo matching for mainly the static areas with video depth diffusion for maintaining consistent depth transitions in dynamic areas. We mathematically demonstrate how stereo matching and video depth diffusion offer complementary strengths through frequency domain analysis, highlighting the effectiveness of their synergy in capturing the advantages of both. Experimental results on zero-shot, real-world, dynamic video depth benchmarks, both indoor and outdoor, demonstrate StereoDiff's SoTA performance, showcasing its superior consistency and accuracy in video depth estimation.</description>

      <title>ConViTac: Aligning Visual-Tactile Fusion with Contrastive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision and touch are two fundamental sensory modalities for robots, offering complementary information that enhances perception and manipulation tasks. Previous research has attempted to jointly learn visual-tactile representations to extract more meaningful information. However, these approaches often rely on direct combination, such as feature addition and concatenation, for modality fusion, which tend to result in poor feature integration. In this paper, we propose ConViTac, a visual-tactile representation learning network designed to enhance the alignment of features during fusion using contrastive representations. Our key contribution is a Contrastive Embedding Conditioning (CEC) mechanism that leverages a contrastive encoder pretrained through self-supervised contrastive learning to project visual and tactile inputs into unified latent embeddings. These embeddings are used to couple visual-tactile feature fusion through cross-modal attention, aiming at aligning the unified representations and enhancing performance on downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of ConViTac in real world over current state-of-the-art methods and the effectiveness of our proposed CEC mechanism, which improves accuracy by up to 12.0% in material classification and grasping prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven MRI-based Brain Tumour Segmentation Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has greatly aided medical diagnosis, with U-Net based architectures and nnU-Net providing state-of-the-art performance. There have been numerous general promptable models and medical variations introduced in recent years, but there is currently a lack of evaluation and comparison of these models across a variety of prompt qualities on a common medical dataset. This research uses Segment Anything Model (SAM), Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), MedSAM, SAM-Med-3D, and nnU-Net to obtain zero-shot inference on the BraTS 2023 adult glioma and pediatrics dataset across multiple prompt qualities for both points and bounding boxes. Several of these models exhibit promising Dice scores, particularly SAM and SAM 2 achieving scores of up to 0.894 and 0.893, respectively when given extremely accurate bounding box prompts which exceeds nnU-Net's segmentation performance. However, nnU-Net remains the dominant medical image segmentation network due to the impracticality of providing highly accurate prompts to the models. The model and prompt evaluation, as well as the comparison, are extended through fine-tuning SAM, SAM 2, MedSAM, and SAM-Med-3D on the pediatrics dataset. The improvements in point prompt performance after fine-tuning are substantial and show promise for future investigation, but are unable to achieve better segmentation than bounding boxes or nnU-Net.</description>

      <title>How do Foundation Models Compare to Skeleton-Based Approaches for Gesture Recognition in Human-Robot Interaction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gestures enable non-verbal human-robot communication, especially in noisy environments like agile production. Traditional deep learning-based gesture recognition relies on task-specific architectures using images, videos, or skeletal pose estimates as input. Meanwhile, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) with their strong generalization abilities offer potential to reduce system complexity by replacing dedicated task-specific modules. This study investigates adapting such models for dynamic, full-body gesture recognition, comparing V-JEPA (a state-of-the-art VFM), Gemini Flash 2.0 (a multimodal VLM), and HD-GCN (a top-performing skeleton-based approach). We introduce NUGGET, a dataset tailored for human-robot communication in intralogistics environments, to evaluate the different gesture recognition approaches. In our experiments, HD-GCN achieves best performance, but V-JEPA comes close with a simple, task-specific classification head - thus paving a possible way towards reducing system complexity, by using it as a shared multi-task model. In contrast, Gemini struggles to differentiate gestures based solely on textual descriptions in the zero-shot setting, highlighting the need of further research on suitable input representations for gestures.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Models to Select Trustworthy Super-Resolution Samples Generated by Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible solutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive SR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single solution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity in information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On the other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but selecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This paper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most trustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs such as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries to assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The top-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy output in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of VLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid metric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components: semantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on edge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition. We empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both ambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield high TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail to reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable, and generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR space. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness, this work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.</description>

      <title>FixCLR: Negative-Class Contrastive Learning for Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) aims to solve the problem of generalizing to out-of-distribution data when only a few labels are available. Due to label scarcity, applying domain generalization methods often underperform. Consequently, existing SSDG methods combine semi-supervised learning methods with various regularization terms. However, these methods do not explicitly regularize to learn domains invariant representations across all domains, which is a key goal for domain generalization. To address this, we introduce FixCLR. Inspired by success in self-supervised learning, we change two crucial components to adapt contrastive learning for explicit domain invariance regularization: utilization of class information from pseudo-labels and using only a repelling term. FixCLR can also be added on top of most existing SSDG and semi-supervised methods for complementary performance improvements. Our research includes extensive experiments that have not been previously explored in SSDG studies. These experiments include benchmarking different improvements to semi-supervised methods, evaluating the performance of pretrained versus non-pretrained models, and testing on datasets with many domains. Overall, FixCLR proves to be an effective SSDG method, especially when combined with other semi-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Vector Contrastive Learning For Pixel-Wise Pretraining In Medical Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised pretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise representation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard CL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the excessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem, breaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class distribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem, enabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling feature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel paradigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER establishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent optimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a vector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving pixel-wise feature correlations in SSP. Extensive experiments across 8 tasks, spanning 2 dimensions and 4 modalities, show that COVER significantly improves pixel-wise SSP, advancing generalizable medical visual foundation models.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Ambiguous Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with Soft Label-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is a task that estimates emotions from facial expression video sequences. For practical applications, accurately recognizing ambiguous facial expressions -- frequently encountered in in-the-wild data -- is essential. In this study, we propose MIDAS, a data augmentation method designed to enhance DFER performance for ambiguous facial expression data using soft labels representing probabilities of multiple emotion classes. MIDAS augments training data by convexly combining pairs of video frames and their corresponding emotion class labels. This approach extends mixup to soft-labeled video data, offering a simple yet highly effective method for handling ambiguity in DFER. To evaluate MIDAS, we conducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly constructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset. The results demonstrate that models trained with MIDAS-augmented data achieve superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art method trained on the original dataset.</description>

      <title>THIRDEYE: Cue-Aware Monocular Depth Estimation via Brain-Inspired Multi-Stage Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation methods traditionally train deep models to infer depth directly from RGB pixels. This implicit learning often overlooks explicit monocular cues that the human visual system relies on, such as occlusion boundaries, shading, and perspective. Rather than expecting a network to discover these cues unaided, we present ThirdEye, a cue-aware pipeline that deliberately supplies each cue through specialised, pre-trained, and frozen networks. These cues are fused in a three-stage cortical hierarchy (V1-&gt;V2-&gt;V3) equipped with a key-value working-memory module that weights them by reliability. An adaptive-bins transformer head then produces a high-resolution disparity map. Because the cue experts are frozen, ThirdEye inherits large amounts of external supervision while requiring only modest fine-tuning. This extended version provides additional architectural detail, neuroscientific motivation, and an expanded experimental protocol; quantitative results will appear in a future revision.</description>

      <title>MultiHuman-Testbench: Benchmarking Image Generation for Multiple Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the geometric foundations of modern stereo vision systems, with a focus on how 3D structure and human-inspired perception contribute to accurate depth reconstruction. We revisit the Cyclopean Eye model and propose novel geometric constraints that account for occlusions and depth discontinuities. Our analysis includes the evaluation of stereo feature matching quality derived from deep learning models, as well as the role of attention mechanisms in recovering meaningful 3D surfaces. Through both theoretical insights and empirical studies on real datasets, we demonstrate that combining strong geometric priors with learned features provides internal abstractions for understanding stereo vision systems.</description>

      <title>FaSTA$^*$: Fast-Slow Toolpath Agent with Subroutine Mining for Efficient Multi-turn Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a cost-efficient neurosymbolic agent to address challenging multi-turn image editing tasks such as "Detect the bench in the image while recoloring it to pink. Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$ search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$ search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$ search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.</description>

      <title>M2SFormer: Multi-Spectral and Multi-Scale Attention with Edge-Aware Difficulty Guidance for Image Forgery Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image editing techniques have rapidly advanced, facilitating both innovative use cases and malicious manipulation of digital images. Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across unseen domains.</description>

      <title>PhysRig: Differentiable Physics-Based Skinning and Rigging Framework for Realistic Articulated Object Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skinning and rigging are fundamental components in animation, articulated object reconstruction, motion transfer, and 4D generation. Existing approaches predominantly rely on Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), due to its simplicity and differentiability. However, LBS introduces artifacts such as volume loss and unnatural deformations, and it fails to model elastic materials like soft tissues, fur, and flexible appendages (e.g., elephant trunks, ears, and fatty tissues). In this work, we propose PhysRig: a differentiable physics-based skinning and rigging framework that overcomes these limitations by embedding the rigid skeleton into a volumetric representation (e.g., a tetrahedral mesh), which is simulated as a deformable soft-body structure driven by the animated skeleton. Our method leverages continuum mechanics and discretizes the object as particles embedded in an Eulerian background grid to ensure differentiability with respect to both material properties and skeletal motion. Additionally, we introduce material prototypes, significantly reducing the learning space while maintaining high expressiveness. To evaluate our framework, we construct a comprehensive synthetic dataset using meshes from Objaverse, The Amazing Animals Zoo, and MixaMo, covering diverse object categories and motion patterns. Our method consistently outperforms traditional LBS-based approaches, generating more realistic and physically plausible results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the pose transfer task highlighting its versatility for articulated object modeling.</description>

      <title>AIR-VIEW: The Aviation Image Repository for Visibility Estimation of Weather, A Dataset and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning for aviation weather is a growing area of research for providing low-cost alternatives for traditional, expensive weather sensors; however, in the area of atmospheric visibility estimation, publicly available datasets, tagged with visibility estimates, of distances relevant for aviation, of diverse locations, of sufficient size for use in supervised learning, are absent. This paper introduces a new dataset which represents the culmination of a year-long data collection campaign of images from the FAA weather camera network suitable for this purpose. We also present a benchmark when applying three commonly used approaches and a general-purpose baseline when trained and tested on three publicly available datasets, in addition to our own, when compared against a recently ratified ASTM standard.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Sub-action Tree for Continuous Sign Language Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) aims to transcribe untrimmed videos into glosses, which are typically textual words. Recent studies indicate that the lack of large datasets and precise annotations has become a bottleneck for CSLR due to insufficient training data. To address this, some works have developed cross-modal solutions to align visual and textual modalities. However, they typically extract textual features from glosses without fully utilizing their knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Sub-action Tree (HST), termed HST-CSLR, to efficiently combine gloss knowledge with visual representation learning. By incorporating gloss-specific knowledge from large language models, our approach leverages textual information more effectively. Specifically, we construct an HST for textual information representation, aligning visual and textual modalities step-by-step and benefiting from the tree structure to reduce computational complexity. Additionally, we impose a contrastive alignment enhancement to bridge the gap between the two modalities. Experiments on four datasets (PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and Sign Language Gesture) demonstrate the effectiveness of our HST-CSLR.</description>

      <title>OmniEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Omni-modal Models with Visual, Auditory, and Textual Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OmniEval, a benchmark for evaluating omni-modality models like MiniCPM-O 2.6, which encompasses visual, auditory, and textual inputs. Compared with existing benchmarks, our OmniEval has several distinctive features: (i) Full-modal collaboration: We design evaluation tasks that highlight the strong coupling between audio and video, requiring models to effectively leverage the collaborative perception of all modalities; (ii) Diversity of videos: OmniEval includes 810 audio-visual synchronized videos, 285 Chinese videos and 525 English videos; (iii) Diversity and granularity of tasks: OmniEval contains 2617 question-answer pairs, comprising 1412 open-ended questions and 1205 multiple-choice questions. These questions are divided into 3 major task types and 12 sub-task types to achieve comprehensive evaluation. Among them, we introduce a more granular video localization task named Grounding. Then we conduct experiments on OmniEval with several omni-modality models. We hope that our OmniEval can provide a platform for evaluating the ability to construct and understand coherence from the context of all modalities. Codes and data could be found at https://omnieval.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Evidence-based diagnostic reasoning with multi-agent copilot for human pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology is experiencing rapid digital transformation driven by whole-slide imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</description>

      <title>DFVEdit: Conditional Delta Flow Vector for Zero-shot Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Video Diffusion Transformers (Video DiTs) marks a milestone in video generation. However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85\% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</description>

      <title>From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency.</description>

      <title>3D Scene-Camera Representation with Joint Camera Photometric Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing scenes from multi-view images is a crucial task in computer vision with extensive applications. However, inherent photometric distortions in the camera imaging can significantly degrade image quality. Without accounting for these distortions, the 3D scene representation may inadvertently incorporate erroneous information unrelated to the scene, diminishing the quality of the representation. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D scene-camera representation with joint camera photometric optimization. By introducing internal and external photometric model, we propose a full photometric model and corresponding camera representation. Based on simultaneously optimizing the parameters of the camera representation, the proposed method effectively separates scene-unrelated information from the 3D scene representation. Additionally, during the optimization of the photometric parameters, we introduce a depth regularization to prevent the 3D scene representation from fitting scene-unrelated information. By incorporating the camera model as part of the mapping process, the proposed method constructs a complete map that includes both the scene radiance field and the camera photometric model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-quality 3D scene representations, even under conditions of imaging degradation, such as vignetting and dirt.</description>

      <title>Rethink Sparse Signals for Pose-guided Text-to-image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works favored dense signals (e.g., depth, DensePose), as an alternative to sparse signals (e.g., OpenPose), to provide detailed spatial guidance for pose-guided text-to-image generation. However, dense representations raised new challenges, including editing difficulties and potential inconsistencies with textual prompts. This fact motivates us to revisit sparse signals for pose guidance, owing to their simplicity and shape-agnostic nature, which remains underexplored. This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Pose ControlNet(SP-Ctrl), equipping sparse signals with robust controllability for pose-guided image generation. Specifically, we extend OpenPose to a learnable spatial representation, making keypoint embeddings discriminative and expressive. Additionally, we introduce keypoint concept learning, which encourages keypoint tokens to attend to the spatial positions of each keypoint, thus improving pose alignment. Experiments on animal- and human-centric image generation tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms recent spatially controllable T2I generation approaches under sparse-pose guidance and even matches the performance of dense signal-based methods. Moreover, SP-Ctrl shows promising capabilities in diverse and cross-species generation through sparse signals. Codes will be available at https://github.com/DREAMXFAR/SP-Ctrl.</description>

      <title>EVA: Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) investigates compositional generalization capacity to recognize unknown state-object pairs based on learned primitive concepts. Existing CZSL methods typically derive primitives features through a simple composition-prototype mapping, which is suboptimal for a set of individuals that can be divided into distinct semantic subsets. Moreover, the all-to-one cross-modal primitives matching neglects compositional divergence within identical states or objects, limiting fine-grained image-composition alignment. In this study, we propose EVA, a Mixture-of-Experts Semantic Variant Alignment framework for CZSL. Specifically, we introduce domain-expert adaption, leveraging multiple experts to achieve token-aware learning and model high-quality primitive representations. To enable accurate compositional generalization, we further present semantic variant alignment to select semantically relevant representation for image-primitives matching. Our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art CZSL methods on three popular benchmarks in both closed- and open-world settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed insight.</description>

      <title>Segment Anything in Pathology Images with Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg , the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 17 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.</description>

      <title>TSDASeg: A Two-Stage Model with Direct Alignment for Interactive Point Cloud Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of 3D vision-language models (VLMs) has spurred significant interest in interactive point cloud processing tasks, particularly for real-world applications. However, existing methods often underperform in point-level tasks, such as segmentation, due to missing direct 3D-text alignment, limiting their ability to link local 3D features with textual context. To solve this problem, we propose TSDASeg, a Two-Stage model coupled with a Direct cross-modal Alignment module and memory module for interactive point cloud Segmentation. We introduce the direct cross-modal alignment module to establish explicit alignment between 3D point clouds and textual/2D image data. Within the memory module, we employ multiple dedicated memory banks to separately store text features, visual features, and their cross-modal correspondence mappings. These memory banks are dynamically leveraged through self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to update scene-specific features based on prior stored data, effectively addressing inconsistencies in interactive segmentation results across diverse scenarios. Experiments conducted on multiple 3D instruction, reference, and semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Step-by-Step Video-to-Audio Synthesis via Negative Audio Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel step-by-step video-to-audio generation method that sequentially produces individual audio tracks, each corresponding to a specific sound event in the video. Our approach mirrors traditional Foley workflows, aiming to capture all sound events induced by a given video comprehensively. Each generation step is formulated as a guided video-to-audio synthesis task, conditioned on a target text prompt and previously generated audio tracks. This design is inspired by the idea of concept negation from prior compositional generation frameworks. To enable this guided generation, we introduce a training framework that leverages pre-trained video-to-audio models and eliminates the need for specialized paired datasets, allowing training on more accessible data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates multiple semantically distinct audio tracks for a single input video, leading to higher-quality composite audio synthesis than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>DBMovi-GS: Dynamic View Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis is a task of generating scenes from unseen perspectives; however, synthesizing dynamic scenes from blurry monocular videos remains an unresolved challenge that has yet to be effectively addressed. Existing novel view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting (DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic motion variations. Our model achieves robust performance in novel view synthesis under dynamic blurry scenes and sets a new benchmark in realistic novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video inputs.</description>

      <title>Style-Aligned Image Composition for Robust Detection of Abnormal Cells in Cytopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Challenges such as the lack of high-quality annotations, long-tailed data distributions, and inconsistent staining styles pose significant obstacles to training neural networks to detect abnormal cells in cytopathology robustly. This paper proposes a style-aligned image composition (SAIC) method that composes high-fidelity and style-preserved pathological images to enhance the effectiveness and robustness of detection models. Without additional training, SAIC first selects an appropriate candidate from the abnormal cell bank based on attribute guidance. Then, it employs a high-frequency feature reconstruction to achieve a style-aligned and high-fidelity composition of abnormal cells and pathological backgrounds. Finally, it introduces a large vision-language model to filter high-quality synthesis images. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating SAIC-synthesized images effectively enhances the performance and robustness of abnormal cell detection for tail categories and styles, thereby improving overall detection performance.

      <description>arXiv:2506.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene text removal (STR) aims to erase textual elements from images. It was originally intended for removing privacy-sensitiveor undesired texts from natural scene images, but is now also appliedto typographic images. STR typically detects text regions and theninpaints them. Although STR has advanced through neural networksand synthetic data, misuse risks have increased. This paper investi-gates Inverse STR (ISTR), which analyzes STR-processed images andfocuses on binary classification (detecting whether an image has un-dergone STR) and localizing removed text regions. We demonstrate inexperiments that these tasks are achievable with high accuracies, en-abling detection of potential misuse and improving STR. We also at-tempt to recover the removed text content by training a text recognizerto understand its difficulty.</description>

      <title>VisionGuard: Synergistic Framework for Helmet Violation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enforcing helmet regulations among motorcyclists is essential for enhancing road safety and ensuring the effectiveness of traffic management systems. However, automatic detection of helmet violations faces significant challenges due to environmental variability, camera angles, and inconsistencies in the data. These factors hinder reliable detection of motorcycles and riders and disrupt consistent object classification. To address these challenges, we propose VisionGuard, a synergistic multi-stage framework designed to overcome the limitations of frame-wise detectors, especially in scenarios with class imbalance and inconsistent annotations. VisionGuard integrates two key components: Adaptive Labeling and Contextual Expander modules. The Adaptive Labeling module is a tracking-based refinement technique that enhances classification consistency by leveraging a tracking algorithm to assign persistent labels across frames and correct misclassifications. The Contextual Expander module improves recall for underrepresented classes by generating virtual bounding boxes with appropriate confidence scores, effectively addressing the impact of data imbalance. Experimental results show that VisionGuard improves overall mAP by 3.1% compared to baseline detectors, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-world deployment in traffic surveillance systems, ultimately promoting safety and regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Detection of Breast Cancer Lumpectomy Margin with SAM-incorporated Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during lumpectomy is essential in reducing breast cancer recurrence. However, 2D specimen radiography (SR), the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status, has limited accuracy, resulting in nearly a quarter of patients requiring additional surgery. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning framework combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL), a pre-training strategy leveraging both local and global contrastive learning for patch-level classification of SR images. After annotating SR images with regions of known maligancy, non-malignant tissue, and pathology-confirmed margins, we pre-train a ResNet-18 backbone with FFCL to classify margin status, then reconstruct coarse binary masks to prompt SAM for refined tumor margin segmentation. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.8455 for margin classification and segmented margins with a 27.4% improvement in Dice similarity over baseline models, while reducing inference time to 47 milliseconds per image. These results demonstrate that FFCL-SAM significantly enhances both the speed and accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment, with strong potential to reduce re-excision rates and improve surgical outcomes in breast cancer treatment.

      <title>The Aging Multiverse: Generating Condition-Aware Facial Aging Tree via Training-Free Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.</description>

      <title>User-in-the-Loop View Sampling with Error Peaking Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) provides ways to visualize missing view samples for novel view synthesis. Existing approaches present 3D annotations for new view samples and task users with taking images by aligning the AR display. This data collection task is known to be mentally demanding and limits capture areas to pre-defined small areas due to the ideal but restrictive underlying sampling theory. To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system. We also show that our approach can contribute to recent radiance field reconstruction for larger scenes, such as 3D Gaussian splatting.</description>

      <title>Bridging Video Quality Scoring and Justification via Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical video quality assessment (VQA) methods generate a numerical score to judge a video's perceived visual fidelity and clarity. Yet, a score fails to describe the video's complex quality dimensions, restricting its applicability. Benefiting from the linguistic output, adapting video large multimodal models (LMMs) to VQA via instruction tuning has the potential to address this issue. The core of the approach lies in the video quality-centric instruction data. Previous explorations mainly focus on the image domain, and their data generation processes heavily rely on human quality annotations and proprietary systems, limiting data scalability and effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Score-based Instruction Generation (SIG) pipeline. Specifically, SIG first scores multiple quality dimensions of an unlabeled video and maps scores to text-defined levels. It then explicitly incorporates a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to model the correlation between specific dimensions and overall quality, mimicking the human visual system's reasoning process. The automated pipeline eliminates the reliance on expert-written quality descriptions and proprietary systems, ensuring data scalability and generation efficiency. To this end, the resulting Score2Instruct (S2I) dataset contains over 320K diverse instruction-response pairs, laying the basis for instruction tuning. Moreover, to advance video LMMs' quality scoring and justification abilities simultaneously, we devise a progressive tuning strategy to fully unleash the power of S2I. Built upon SIG, we further curate a benchmark termed S2I-Bench with 400 open-ended questions to better evaluate the quality justification capacity of video LMMs. Experimental results on the S2I-Bench and existing benchmarks indicate that our method consistently improves quality scoring and justification capabilities across multiple video LMMs.</description>

      <title>FedSC: Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train models collaboratively across clients without sharing data for privacy-preserving. However, one major challenge is the data heterogeneity issue, which refers to the biased labeling preferences at multiple clients. A number of existing FL methods attempt to tackle data heterogeneity locally (e.g., regularizing local models) or globally (e.g., fine-tuning global model), often neglecting inherent semantic information contained in each client. To explore the possibility of using intra-client semantically meaningful knowledge in handling data heterogeneity, in this paper, we propose Federated Learning with Semantic-Aware Collaboration (FedSC) to capture client-specific and class-relevant knowledge across heterogeneous clients. The core idea of FedSC is to construct relational prototypes and consistent prototypes at semantic-level, aiming to provide fruitful class underlying knowledge and stable convergence signals in a prototype-wise collaborative way. On the one hand, FedSC introduces an inter-contrastive learning strategy to bring instance-level embeddings closer to relational prototypes with the same semantics and away from distinct classes. On the other hand, FedSC devises consistent prototypes via a discrepancy aggregation manner, as a regularization penalty to constrain the optimization region of the local model. Moreover, a theoretical analysis for FedSC is provided to ensure a convergence guarantee. Experimental results on various challenging scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSC and the efficiency of crucial components.</description>

      <title>HybridQ: Hybrid Classical-Quantum Generative Adversarial Network for Skin Disease Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning-assisted diagnosis is gaining traction in skin disease detection, but training effective models requires large amounts of high-quality data. Skin disease datasets often suffer from class imbalance, privacy concerns, and object bias, making data augmentation essential. While classical generative models are widely used, they demand extensive computational resources and lengthy training time. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods can only yield grayscale low-quality images. Through a novel classical-quantum latent space fusion technique, our work overcomes this limitation and introduces the first classical-quantum generative adversarial network (GAN) capable of generating color medical images. Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs and existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and classification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the performance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art classical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10 times fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for quantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate the robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware noise.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success, current VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to capture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for distinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called MPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process of prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable representations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt generation strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to generate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based external knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature discrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the generalization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach incorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the prompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with class-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local alignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further improving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained model and minimizing computational costs.</description>

      <title>LASFNet: A Lightweight Attention-Guided Self-Modulation Feature Fusion Network for Multimodal Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective deep feature extraction via feature-level fusion is crucial for multimodal object detection. However, previous studies often involve complex training processes that integrate modality-specific features by stacking multiple feature-level fusion units, leading to significant computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new fusion detection baseline that uses a single feature-level fusion unit to enable high-performance detection, thereby simplifying the training process. Based on this approach, we propose a lightweight attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion network (LASFNet), which introduces a novel attention-guided self-modulation feature fusion (ASFF) module that adaptively adjusts the responses of fusion features at both global and local levels based on attention information from different modalities, thereby promoting comprehensive and enriched feature generation. Additionally, a lightweight feature attention transformation module (FATM) is designed at the neck of LASFNet to enhance the focus on fused features and minimize information loss. Extensive experiments on three representative datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-off, reducing the number of parameters and computational cost by as much as 90% and 85%, respectively, while improving detection accuracy (mAP) by 1%-3%. The code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/leileilei2000/LASFNet.</description>

      <title>Instella-T2I: Pushing the Limits of 1D Discrete Latent Space Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image tokenization plays a critical role in reducing the computational demands of modeling high-resolution images, significantly improving the efficiency of image and multimodal understanding and generation. Recent advances in 1D latent spaces have reduced the number of tokens required by eliminating the need for a 2D grid structure. In this paper, we further advance compact discrete image representation by introducing 1D binary image latents. By representing each image as a sequence of binary vectors, rather than using traditional one-hot codebook tokens, our approach preserves high-resolution details while maintaining the compactness of 1D latents. To the best of our knowledge, our text-to-image models are the first to achieve competitive performance in both diffusion and auto-regressive generation using just 128 discrete tokens for images up to 1024x1024, demonstrating up to a 32-fold reduction in token numbers compared to standard VQ-VAEs. The proposed 1D binary latent space, coupled with simple model architectures, achieves marked improvements in speed training and inference speed. Our text-to-image models allow for a global batch size of 4096 on a single GPU node with 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, and the training can be completed within 200 GPU days. Our models achieve competitive performance compared to modern image generation models without any in-house private training data or post-training refinements, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional tokenization methods.</description>

      <title>DidSee: Diffusion-Based Depth Completion for Material-Agnostic Robotic Perception and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects. First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss. Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation and robotic grasping.Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/</description>

      <title>Boosting Domain Generalized and Adaptive Detection with Diffusion Models: Fitness, Generalization, and Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detectors often suffer from performance drop due to domain gap between training and testing data. Recent methods explore diffusion models applied to domain generalization (DG) and adaptation (DA) tasks, but still struggle with large inference costs and have not yet fully leveraged the capabilities of diffusion models. We propose to tackle these problems by extracting intermediate features from a single-step diffusion process, improving feature collection and fusion to reduce inference time by 75% while enhancing performance on source domains (i.e., Fitness). Then, we construct an object-centered auxiliary branch by applying box-masked images with class prompts to extract robust and domain-invariant features that focus on object. We also apply consistency loss to align the auxiliary and ordinary branch, balancing fitness and generalization while preventing overfitting and improving performance on target domains (i.e., Generalization). Furthermore, within a unified framework, standard detectors are guided by diffusion detectors through feature-level and object-level alignment on source domains (for DG) and unlabeled target domains (for DA), thereby improving cross-domain detection performance (i.e., Transferability). Our method achieves competitive results on 3 DA benchmarks and 5 DG benchmarks. Additionally, experiments on COCO generalization benchmark demonstrate that our method maintains significant advantages and show remarkable efficiency in large domain shifts and low-data scenarios. Our work shows the superiority of applying diffusion models to domain generalized and adaptive detection tasks and offers valuable insights for visual perception tasks across diverse domains.

      <title>Improving Diffusion-Based Image Editing Faithfulness via Guidance and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.</description>

      <title>Boosting Generative Adversarial Transferability with Self-supervised Vision Transformer Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) come from extracting and interpreting features from the data provided. By exploiting intermediate features in DNNs instead of relying on hard labels, we craft adversarial perturbation that generalize more effectively, boosting black-box transferability. These features ubiquitously come from supervised learning in previous work. Inspired by the exceptional synergy between self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture, this paper explores whether exploiting self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) representations can improve adversarial transferability. We present dSVA -- a generative dual self-supervised ViT features attack, that exploits both global structural features from contrastive learning (CL) and local textural features from masked image modeling (MIM), the self-supervised learning paradigm duo for ViTs. We design a novel generative training framework that incorporates a generator to create black-box adversarial examples, and strategies to train the generator by exploiting joint features and the attention mechanism of self-supervised ViTs. Our findings show that CL and MIM enable ViTs to attend to distinct feature tendencies, which, when exploited in tandem, boast great adversarial generalizability. By disrupting dual deep features distilled by self-supervised ViTs, we are rewarded with remarkable black-box transferability to models of various architectures that outperform state-of-the-arts.

      <title>Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching in Document Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document understanding and analysis have received a lot of attention due to their widespread application. However, existing document analysis solutions, such as document layout analysis and key information extraction, are only suitable for fixed category definitions and granularities, and cannot achieve flexible applications customized by users. Therefore, this paper defines a new task named ``Class-Agnostic Region-of-Interest Matching'' (``RoI-Matching'' for short), which aims to match the customized regions in a flexible, efficient, multi-granularity, and open-set manner. The visual prompt of the reference document and target document images are fed into our model, while the output is the corresponding bounding boxes in the target document images. To meet the above requirements, we construct a benchmark RoI-Matching-Bench, which sets three levels of difficulties following real-world conditions, and propose the macro and micro metrics to evaluate. Furthermore, we also propose a new framework RoI-Matcher, which employs a siamese network to extract multi-level features both in the reference and target domains, and cross-attention layers to integrate and align similar semantics in different domains. Experiments show that our method with a simple procedure is effective on RoI-Matching-Bench, and serves as the baseline for further research. The code is available at https://github.com/pd162/RoI-Matching.</description>

      <title>SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving 3D objects in complex indoor environments using only a masked 2D image and a natural language description presents significant challenges. The ROOMELSA challenge limits access to full 3D scene context, complicating reasoning about object appearance, geometry, and semantics. These challenges are intensified by distorted viewpoints, textureless masked regions, ambiguous language prompts, and noisy segmentation masks. To address this, we propose SAMURAI: Shape-Aware Multimodal Retrieval for 3D Object Identification. SAMURAI integrates CLIP-based semantic matching with shape-guided re-ranking derived from binary silhouettes of masked regions, alongside a robust majority voting strategy. A dedicated preprocessing pipeline enhances mask quality by extracting the largest connected component and removing background noise. Our hybrid retrieval framework leverages both language and shape cues, achieving competitive performance on the ROOMELSA private test set. These results highlight the importance of combining shape priors with language understanding for robust open-world 3D object retrieval.</description>

      <title>PoseMaster: Generating 3D Characters in Arbitrary Poses from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D characters play a crucial role in our daily entertainment. To improve the efficiency of 3D character modeling, recent image-based methods use two separate models to achieve pose standardization and 3D reconstruction of the A-pose character. However, these methods are prone to generating distorted and degraded images in the pose standardization stage due to self-occlusion and viewpoints, which further affects the geometric quality of the subsequent reconstruction process. To tackle these problems, we propose PoseMaster, an end-to-end controllable 3D character generation framework. Specifically, we unify pose transformation and 3D character generation into a flow-based 3D native generation framework. To achieve accurate arbitrary-pose control, we propose to leverage the 3D body bones existing in the skeleton of an animatable character as the pose condition. Furthermore, considering the specificity of multi-condition control, we randomly empty the pose condition and the image condition during training to improve the effectiveness and generalizability of pose control. Finally, we create a high-quality pose-control dataset derived from realistic character animation data to make the model learning the implicit relationships between skeleton and skinning weights. Extensive experiments show that PoseMaster outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for A-pose character generation while demonstrating its powerful ability to achieve precise control for arbitrary poses.</description>

      <title>EgoAdapt: Adaptive Multisensory Distillation and Policy Learning for Efficient Egocentric Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern perception models, particularly those designed for multisensory egocentric tasks, have achieved remarkable performance but often come with substantial computational costs. These high demands pose challenges for real-world deployment, especially in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce EgoAdapt, a framework that adaptively performs cross-modal distillation and policy learning to enable efficient inference across different egocentric perception tasks, including egocentric action recognition, active speaker localization, and behavior anticipation. Our proposed policy module is adaptable to task-specific action spaces, making it broadly applicable. Experimental results on three challenging egocentric datasets EPIC-Kitchens, EasyCom, and Aria Everyday Activities demonstrate that our method significantly enhances efficiency, reducing GMACs by up to 89.09%, parameters up to 82.02%, and energy up to 9.6x, while still on-par and in many cases outperforming, the performance of corresponding state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>ESMStereo: Enhanced ShuffleMixer Disparity Upsampling for Real-Time and Accurate Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo matching has become an increasingly important component of modern autonomous systems. Developing deep learning-based stereo matching models that deliver high accuracy while operating in real-time continues to be a major challenge in computer vision. In the domain of cost-volume-based stereo matching, accurate disparity estimation depends heavily on large-scale cost volumes. However, such large volumes store substantial redundant information and also require computationally intensive aggregation units for processing and regression, making real-time performance unattainable. Conversely, small-scale cost volumes followed by lightweight aggregation units provide a promising route for real-time performance, but lack sufficient information to ensure highly accurate disparity estimation. To address this challenge, we propose the Enhanced Shuffle Mixer (ESM) to mitigate information loss associated with small-scale cost volumes. ESM restores critical details by integrating primary features into the disparity upsampling unit. It quickly extracts features from the initial disparity estimation and fuses them with image features. These features are mixed by shuffling and layer splitting then refined through a compact feature-guided hourglass network to recover more detailed scene geometry. The ESM focuses on local contextual connectivity with a large receptive field and low computational cost, leading to the reconstruction of a highly accurate disparity map at real-time. The compact version of ESMStereo achieves an inference speed of 116 FPS on high-end GPUs and 91 FPS on the AGX Orin.</description>

      <title>OracleFusion: Assisting the Decipherment of Oracle Bone Script with Structurally Constrained Semantic Typography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the earliest ancient languages, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) encapsulates the cultural records and intellectual expressions of ancient civilizations. Despite the discovery of approximately 4,500 OBS characters, only about 1,600 have been deciphered. The remaining undeciphered ones, with their complex structure and abstract imagery, pose significant challenges for interpretation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel two-stage semantic typography framework, named OracleFusion. In the first stage, this approach leverages the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with enhanced Spatial Awareness Reasoning (SAR) to analyze the glyph structure of the OBS character and perform visual localization of key components. In the second stage, we introduce Oracle Structural Vector Fusion (OSVF), incorporating glyph structure constraints and glyph maintenance constraints to ensure the accurate generation of semantically enriched vector fonts. This approach preserves the objective integrity of the glyph structure, offering visually enhanced representations that assist experts in deciphering OBS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that OracleFusion outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of semantics, visual appeal, and glyph maintenance, significantly enhancing both readability and aesthetic quality. Furthermore, OracleFusion provides expert-like insights on unseen oracle characters, making it a valuable tool for advancing the decipherment of OBS.</description>

      <title>Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Enhanced Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to efficiently capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (&lt;1\% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.</description>

      <title>IPFormer-VideoLLM: Enhancing Multi-modal Video Understanding for Multi-shot Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable understanding capabilities, but are found struggling to tackle multi-shot scenarios,e.g., video clips with varying camera angles or scene changes. This challenge can render failures such as instance identity forgetting and key frame negligence. In this work, we first attribute the challenge to the lack of multi-shot annotations among existing datasets and therefore we introduce a new dataset termed MultiClip-Bench, featuring dense descriptions and instruction-based question-answering pairs tailored for multi-shot scenarios. We empirically find that the training set significantly boosts the multi-shot performance, while the testing benchmark provides a reliable measure of the model capability in multi-shot scenarios. By further analyzing and discovering that current models only encode instance features in a discrete or lossy manner, at the risk of missing identity information, we then contribute a new model IPFormer-VideoLLM. Its key idea is the injection of instance-level features as instance prompts through an efficient attention-based connector. This allows for the aggregation of instance-specific information across scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and model not only enhance the multi-scene video understanding significantly, but also offer distinct advantages across various video benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CL-Splats: Continual Learning of Gaussian Splatting with Local Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI. As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>GoIRL: Graph-Oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction for surrounding agents is a challenging task in autonomous driving due to its inherent uncertainty and underlying multimodality. Unlike prevailing data-driven methods that primarily rely on supervised learning, in this paper, we introduce a novel Graph-oriented Inverse Reinforcement Learning (GoIRL) framework, which is an IRL-based predictor equipped with vectorized context representations. We develop a feature adaptor to effectively aggregate lane-graph features into grid space, enabling seamless integration with the maximum entropy IRL paradigm to infer the reward distribution and obtain the policy that can be sampled to induce multiple plausible plans. Furthermore, conditioned on the sampled plans, we implement a hierarchical parameterized trajectory generator with a refinement module to enhance prediction accuracy and a probability fusion strategy to boost prediction confidence. Extensive experimental results showcase our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Argoverse &amp; nuScenes motion forecasting benchmarks but also exhibits superior generalization abilities compared to existing supervised models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have made promising advances in low-light RAW image enhancement, while their capability to extremely dark scenes where the environmental illuminance drops as low as 0.0001 lux remains to be explored due to the lack of corresponding datasets. To this end, we propose a paired-to-paired data synthesis pipeline capable of generating well-calibrated extremely low-light RAW images at three precise illuminance ranges of 0.01-0.1 lux, 0.001-0.01 lux, and 0.0001-0.001 lux, together with high-quality sRGB references to comprise a large-scale paired dataset named See-in-the-Extremely-Dark (SIED) to benchmark low-light RAW image enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we propose a diffusion-based framework that leverages the generative ability and intrinsic denoising property of diffusion models to restore visually pleasing results from extremely low-SNR RAW inputs, in which an Adaptive Illumination Correction Module (AICM) and a color consistency loss are introduced to ensure accurate exposure correction and color restoration. Extensive experiments on the proposed SIED and publicly available benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/SIED.</description>

      <title>YOLO-FDA: Integrating Hierarchical Attention and Detail Enhancement for Surface Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface defect detection in industrial scenarios is both crucial and technically demanding due to the wide variability in defect types, irregular shapes and sizes, fine-grained requirements, and complex material textures. Although recent advances in AI-based detectors have improved performance, existing methods often suffer from redundant features, limited detail sensitivity, and weak robustness under multiscale conditions. To address these challenges, we propose YOLO-FDA, a novel YOLO-based detection framework that integrates fine-grained detail enhancement and attention-guided feature fusion. Specifically, we adopt a BiFPN-style architecture to strengthen bidirectional multilevel feature aggregation within the YOLOv5 backbone. To better capture fine structural changes, we introduce a Detail-directional Fusion Module (DDFM) that introduces a directional asymmetric convolution in the second-lowest layer to enrich spatial details and fuses the second-lowest layer with low-level features to enhance semantic consistency. Furthermore, we propose two novel attention-based fusion strategies, Attention-weighted Concatenation (AC) and Cross-layer Attention Fusion (CAF) to improve contextual representation and reduce feature noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that YOLO-FDA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness across diverse types of defects and scales.</description>

      <title>Tree-based Semantic Losses: Application to Sparsely-supervised Large Multi-class Hyperspectral Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) shows great promise for surgical applications, offering detailed insights into biological tissue differences beyond what the naked eye can perceive. Refined labelling efforts are underway to train vision systems to distinguish large numbers of subtly varying classes. However, commonly used learning methods for biomedical segmentation tasks penalise all errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the label space. In this work, we introduce two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance on a sparsely annotated HSI dataset comprising $107$ classes organised in a clinically-defined semantic tree structure. Furthermore, our method enables effective detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels without compromising segmentation performance on in-distribution (ID) pixels.</description>

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of myocardial scars from cardiac MRI is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning. In this study, we propose a robust deep-learning pipeline for fully automated myocardial scar detection and segmentation by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models. The method explicitly addresses challenges of label noise from semi-automatic annotations, data heterogeneity, and class imbalance through the use of Kullback-Leibler loss and extensive data augmentation. We evaluate the model's performance on both acute and chronic cases and demonstrate its ability to produce accurate and smooth segmentations despite noisy labels. In particular, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models like nnU-Net and shows strong generalizability in an out-of-distribution test set, highlighting its robustness across various imaging conditions and clinical tasks. These results establish a reliable foundation for automated myocardial scar quantification and support the broader clinical adoption of deep learning in cardiac imaging.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Perception Guided Gaussians for Multiview-consistent 3D Generation from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic 3D objects from single-view images requires natural appearance, 3D consistency, and the ability to capture multiple plausible interpretations of unseen regions. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior, perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Modeling for Unsupervised Simulation-to-Reality Point Cloud Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning semantic representations from point sets of 3D object shapes is often challenged by significant geometric variations, primarily due to differences in data acquisition methods. Typically, training data is generated using point simulators, while testing data is collected with distinct 3D sensors, leading to a simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) domain gap that limits the generalization ability of point classifiers. Current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques struggle with this gap, as they often lack robust, domain-insensitive descriptors capable of capturing global topological information, resulting in overfitting to the limited semantic patterns of the source domain. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Topology-Aware Modeling (TAM) framework for Sim2Real UDA on object point clouds. Our approach mitigates the domain gap by leveraging global spatial topology, characterized by low-level, high-frequency 3D structures, and by modeling the topological relations of local geometric features through a novel self-supervised learning task. Additionally, we propose an advanced self-training strategy that combines cross-domain contrastive learning with self-training, effectively reducing the impact of noisy pseudo-labels and enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Experimental results on three public Sim2Real benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our TAM framework, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated tasks.

      <title>Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, providing a dense, semantically rich environmental representation. However, existing methods focus on in-distribution scenes, making them susceptible to Out-of-Distribution (OoD) objects and long-tail distributions, which increases the risk of undetected anomalies and misinterpretations, posing safety hazards. To address these challenges, we introduce Out-of-Distribution Semantic Occupancy Prediction, targeting OoD detection in 3D voxel space. To fill the gaps in the dataset, we propose a Synthetic Anomaly Integration Pipeline that injects synthetic anomalies while preserving realistic spatial and occlusion patterns, enabling the creation of two datasets: VAA-KITTI and VAA-KITTI-360. We introduce OccOoD, a novel framework integrating OoD detection into 3D semantic occupancy prediction, with Voxel-BEV Progressive Fusion (VBPF) leveraging an RWKV-based branch to enhance OoD detection via geometry-semantic fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that OccOoD achieves state-of-the-art OoD detection with an AuROC of 67.34% and an AuPRCr of 29.21% within a 1.2m region, while maintaining competitive occupancy prediction performance. The established datasets and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/7uHeng/OccOoD.</description>

      <title>GroundFlow: A Plug-in Module for Temporal Reasoning on 3D Point Cloud Sequential Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Constraints: Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoramic image processing is essential for omni-context perception, yet faces constraints like distortions, perspective occlusions, and limited annotations. Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods transfer knowledge from labeled pinhole data to unlabeled panoramic images, but they require access to source pinhole data. To address these, we introduce a more practical task, i.e., Source-Free Occlusion-Aware Seamless Segmentation (SFOASS), and propose its first solution, called UNconstrained Learning Omni-Context Knowledge (UNLOCK). Specifically, UNLOCK includes two key modules: Omni Pseudo-Labeling Learning and Amodal-Driven Context Learning. While adapting without relying on source data or target labels, this framework enhances models to achieve segmentation with 360{\deg} viewpoint coverage and occlusion-aware reasoning. Furthermore, we benchmark the proposed SFOASS task through both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation settings. Experimental results show that our source-free method achieves performance comparable to source-dependent methods, yielding state-of-the-art scores of 10.9 in mAAP and 11.6 in mAP, along with an absolute improvement of +4.3 in mAPQ over the source-only method. All data and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yihong-97/UNLOCK.</description>

      <title>MedPrompt: LLM-CNN Fusion with Weight Routing for Medical Image Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current medical image analysis systems are typically task-specific, requiring separate models for classification and segmentation, and lack the flexibility to support user-defined workflows. To address these challenges, we introduce MedPrompt, a unified framework that combines a few-shot prompted Large Language Model (Llama-4-17B) for high-level task planning with a modular Convolutional Neural Network (DeepFusionLab) for low-level image processing. The LLM interprets user instructions and generates structured output to dynamically route task-specific pretrained weights. This weight routing approach avoids retraining the entire framework when adding new tasks-only task-specific weights are required, enhancing scalability and deployment. We evaluated MedPrompt across 19 public datasets, covering 12 tasks spanning 5 imaging modalities. The system achieves a 97% end-to-end correctness in interpreting and executing prompt-driven instructions, with an average inference latency of 2.5 seconds, making it suitable for near real-time applications. DeepFusionLab achieves competitive segmentation accuracy (e.g., Dice 0.9856 on lungs) and strong classification performance (F1 0.9744 on tuberculosis). Overall, MedPrompt enables scalable, prompt-driven medical imaging by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the efficiency of modular CNNs.</description>

      <title>BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore, it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable detection of generated outputs.</description>

      <title>ReME: A Data-Centric Framework for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images given a set of arbitrary textual categories without costly model fine-tuning. Existing solutions often explore attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, such as CLIP, or generate synthetic data and design complex retrieval processes to perform OVS. However, their performance is limited by the capability of reliant models or the suboptimal quality of reference sets. In this work, we investigate the largely overlooked data quality problem for this challenging dense scene understanding task, and identify that a high-quality reference set can significantly benefit training-free OVS. With this observation, we introduce a data-quality-oriented framework, comprising a data pipeline to construct a reference set with well-paired segment-text embeddings and a simple similarity-based retrieval to unveil the essential effect of data. Remarkably, extensive evaluations on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing training-free OVS approaches, highlighting the importance of data-centric design for advancing OVS without training.

Abstract: This paper presents ESFP, an end-to-end pipeline that converts monocular RGB video into executable joint trajectories for a low-cost 4-DoF desktop arm. ESFP comprises four sequential modules. (1) Estimating: ROMP lifts each frame to a 24-joint 3-D skeleton. (2) Smoothing: the proposed HPSTM-a sequence-to-sequence Transformer with self-attention-combines long-range temporal context with a differentiable forward-kinematics decoder, enforcing constant bone lengths and anatomical plausibility while jointly predicting joint means and full covariances. (3) Filtering: root-normalized trajectories are variance-weighted according to HPSTM's uncertainty estimates, suppressing residual noise. (4) Pose-Mapping: a geometric retargeting layer transforms shoulder-elbow-wrist triples into the uArm's polar workspace, preserving wrist orientation.</description>

      <title>DiMPLe -- Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning: Enhancing Out-Of-Distribution Alignment with Invariant and Spurious Feature Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce DiMPLe (Disentangled Multi-Modal Prompt Learning), a novel approach to disentangle invariant and spurious features across vision and language modalities in multi-modal learning. Spurious correlations in visual data often hinder out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Unlike prior methods focusing solely on image features, DiMPLe disentangles features within and across modalities while maintaining consistent alignment, enabling better generalization to novel classes and robustness to distribution shifts. Our method combines three key objectives: (1) mutual information minimization between invariant and spurious features, (2) spurious feature regularization, and (3) contrastive learning on invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate DiMPLe demonstrates superior performance compared to CoOp-OOD, when averaged across 11 diverse datasets, and achieves absolute gains of 15.27 in base class accuracy and 44.31 in novel class accuracy.</description>

      <title>Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering for Human Motion Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human Motion Segmentation (HMS), which aims to partition videos into non-overlapping human motions, has attracted increasing research attention recently. Existing approaches for HMS are mainly dominated by subspace clustering methods, which are grounded on the assumption that high-dimensional temporal data align with a Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) distribution. However, the frames in video capturing complex human motions with cluttered backgrounds may not align well with the UoS distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for HMS, named Temporal Rate Reduction Clustering ($\text{TR}^2\text{C}$), which jointly learns structured representations and affinity to segment the frame sequences in video. Specifically, the structured representations learned by $\text{TR}^2\text{C}$ maintain temporally consistent and align well with a UoS structure, which is favorable for the HMS task. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark HMS datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances with different feature extractors.</description>

      <title>DuET: Dual Incremental Object Detection via Exemplar-Free Task Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</description>

      <title>WordCon: Word-level Typography Control in Scene Text Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise word-level typography control within generated images remains a persistent challenge. To address it, we newly construct a word-level controlled scene text dataset and introduce the Text-Image Alignment (TIA) framework. This framework leverages cross-modal correspondence between text and local image regions provided by grounding models to enhance the Text-to-Image (T2I) model training. Furthermore, we propose WordCon, a hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. WordCon reparameterizes selective key parameters, improving both efficiency and portability. This allows seamless integration into diverse pipelines, including artistic text rendering, text editing, and image-conditioned text rendering. To further enhance controllability, the masked loss at the latent level is applied to guide the model to concentrate on learning the text region in the image, and the joint-attention loss provides feature-level supervision to promote disentanglement between different words. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the state of the art. The datasets and source code will be available for academic use.</description>

      <title>HumanOmniV2: From Understanding to Omni-Modal Reasoning with Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs, directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information. To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source omni-modal models.</description>

      <title>HieraSurg: Hierarchy-Aware Diffusion Model for Surgical Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical Video Synthesis has emerged as a promising research direction following the success of diffusion models in general-domain video generation. Although existing approaches achieve high-quality video generation, most are unconditional and fail to maintain consistency with surgical actions and phases, lacking the surgical understanding and fine-grained guidance necessary for factual simulation. We address these challenges by proposing HieraSurg, a hierarchy-aware surgical video generation framework consisting of two specialized diffusion models. Given a surgical phase and an initial frame, HieraSurg first predicts future coarse-grained semantic changes through a segmentation prediction model. The final video is then generated by a second-stage model that augments these temporal segmentation maps with fine-grained visual features, leading to effective texture rendering and integration of semantic information in the video space. Our approach leverages surgical information at multiple levels of abstraction, including surgical phase, action triplets, and panoptic segmentation maps. The experimental results on Cholecystectomy Surgical Video Generation demonstrate that the model significantly outperforms prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing strong generalization capabilities and the ability to generate higher frame-rate videos. The model exhibits particularly fine-grained adherence when provided with existing segmentation maps, suggesting its potential for practical surgical applications.</description>

      <title>Continual Self-Supervised Learning with Masked Autoencoders in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of continual learning (CL) methods, which aim to learn new tasks in a sequential manner from the training data acquired continuously, has gained great attention in remote sensing (RS). The existing CL methods in RS, while learning new tasks, enhance robustness towards catastrophic forgetting. This is achieved by using a large number of labeled training samples, which is costly and not always feasible to gather in RS. To address this problem, we propose a novel continual self-supervised learning method in the context of masked autoencoders (denoted as CoSMAE). The proposed CoSMAE consists of two components: i) data mixup; and ii) model mixup knowledge distillation. Data mixup is associated with retaining information on previous data distributions by interpolating images from the current task with those from the previous tasks. Model mixup knowledge distillation is associated with distilling knowledge from past models and the current model simultaneously by interpolating their model weights to form a teacher for the knowledge distillation. The two components complement each other to regularize the MAE at the data and model levels to facilitate better generalization across tasks and reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that CoSMAE achieves significant improvements of up to 4.94% over state-of-the-art CL methods applied to MAE. Our code is publicly available at: https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/CoSMAE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual grounding in text-rich document images is a critical yet underexplored challenge for document intelligence and visual question answering (VQA) systems. We present \drishtikon, a multi-granular visual grounding framework designed to enhance interpretability and trust in VQA for complex, multilingual documents. Our approach integrates robust multi-lingual OCR, large language models, and a novel region matching algorithm to accurately localize answer spans at block, line, word, and point levels. We curate a new benchmark from the CircularsVQA test set, providing fine-grained, human-verified annotations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art grounding accuracy, with line-level granularity offering the best trade-off between precision and recall. Ablation studies further highlight the benefits of multi-block and multi-line reasoning. Comparative evaluations with leading vision-language models reveal the limitations of current VLMs in precise localization, underscoring the effectiveness of our structured, alignment-based approach. Our findings pave the way for more robust and interpretable document understanding systems in real-world, text-centric scenarios.

      <title>LLaVA-Pose: Enhancing Human Pose and Action Understanding via Keypoint-Integrated Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) are well-adapted for general visual understanding tasks. However, they perform inadequately when handling complex visual tasks related to human poses and actions due to the lack of specialized vision-language instruction-following data. We introduce a method for generating such data by integrating human keypoints with traditional visual features such as captions and bounding boxes, enabling more precise understanding of human-centric scenes. Our approach constructs a dataset comprising 200,328 samples tailored to fine-tune models for human-centric tasks, focusing on three areas: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. We establish an Extended Human Pose and Action Understanding Benchmark (E-HPAUB) to assess model performance on human pose and action understanding. We fine-tune the LLaVA-1.5-7B model using this dataset and evaluate our resulting LLaVA-Pose model on the benchmark, achieving significant improvements. Experimental results show an overall improvement of 33.2% compared to the original LLaVA-1.5-7B model. These findings highlight the effectiveness of keypoint-integrated data in enhancing multimodal models for human-centric visual understanding.

      <title>Holistic Surgical Phase Recognition with Hierarchical Input Dependent State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical workflow analysis is essential in robot-assisted surgeries, yet the long duration of such procedures poses significant challenges for comprehensive video analysis. Recent approaches have predominantly relied on transformer models; however, their quadratic attention mechanism restricts efficient processing of lengthy surgical videos. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical input-dependent state space model that leverages the linear scaling property of state space models to enable decision making on full-length videos while capturing both local and global dynamics. Our framework incorporates a temporally consistent visual feature extractor, which appends a state space model head to a visual feature extractor to propagate temporal information. The proposed model consists of two key modules: a local-aggregation state space model block that effectively captures intricate local dynamics, and a global-relation state space model block that models temporal dependencies across the entire video. The model is trained using a hybrid discrete-continuous supervision strategy, where both signals of discrete phase labels and continuous phase progresses are propagated through the network. Experiments have shown that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+2.8% on Cholec80, +4.3% on MICCAI2016, and +12.9% on Heichole datasets). Code will be publicly available after paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>PanSt3R: Multi-view Consistent Panoptic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoptic segmentation of 3D scenes, involving the segmentation and classification of object instances in a dense 3D reconstruction of a scene, is a challenging problem, especially when relying solely on unposed 2D images. Existing approaches typically leverage off-the-shelf models to extract per-frame 2D panoptic segmentations, before optimizing an implicit geometric representation (often based on NeRF) to integrate and fuse the 2D predictions. We argue that relying on 2D panoptic segmentation for a problem inherently 3D and multi-view is likely suboptimal as it fails to leverage the full potential of spatial relationships across views. In addition to requiring camera parameters, these approaches also necessitate computationally expensive test-time optimization for each scene. Instead, in this work, we propose a unified and integrated approach PanSt3R, which eliminates the need for test-time optimization by jointly predicting 3D geometry and multi-view panoptic segmentation in a single forward pass. Our approach builds upon recent advances in 3D reconstruction, specifically upon MUSt3R, a scalable multi-view version of DUSt3R, and enhances it with semantic awareness and multi-view panoptic segmentation capabilities. We additionally revisit the standard post-processing mask merging procedure and introduce a more principled approach for multi-view segmentation. We also introduce a simple method for generating novel-view predictions based on the predictions of PanSt3R and vanilla 3DGS. Overall, the proposed PanSt3R is conceptually simple, yet fast and scalable, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Neural Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) is fundamental in applications such as medical imaging, where the goal is to reconstruct the relative permittivity from scattered electromagnetic field. This inverse process is inherently ill-posed and highly nonlinear, making it particularly challenging. A recent machine learning-based approach, Img-Interiors, shows promising results by leveraging continuous implicit functions. However, it requires case-specific optimization, lacks generalization to unseen data, and fails under sparse transmitter setups (e.g., with only one transmitter). To address these limitations, we revisit EISP from a physics-informed perspective, reformulating it as a two stage inverse transmission-scattering process. This formulation reveals the induced current as a generalizable intermediate representation, effectively decoupling the nonlinear scattering process from the ill-posed inverse problem. Built on this insight, we propose the first generalizable physics-driven framework for EISP, comprising a current estimator and a permittivity solver, working in an end-to-end manner. The current estimator explicitly learns the induced current as a physical bridge between the incident and scattered field, while the permittivity solver computes the relative permittivity directly from the estimated induced current. This design enables data-driven training and generalizable feed-forward prediction of relative permittivity on unseen data while maintaining strong robustness to transmitter sparsity. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in reconstruction accuracy, generalization, and robustness. This work offers a fundamentally new perspective on electromagnetic inverse scattering and represents a major step toward cost-effective practical solutions for electromagnetic imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cinematography, the fundamental visual language of film, is essential for conveying narrative, emotion, and aesthetic quality. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong general visual understanding, their proficiency in comprehending the nuanced cinematic grammar embedded within individual shots remains largely unexplored and lacks robust evaluation. This critical gap limits both fine-grained visual comprehension and the precision of AI-assisted video generation. To address this, we introduce \textbf{ShotBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for cinematic language understanding. It features over 3.5k expert-annotated QA pairs from images and video clips, meticulously curated from over 200 acclaimed (predominantly Oscar-nominated) films and spanning eight key cinematography dimensions. Our evaluation of 24 leading VLMs on ShotBench reveals their substantial limitations: even the top-performing model achieves less than 60\% average accuracy, particularly struggling with fine-grained visual cues and complex spatial reasoning. To catalyze advancement in this domain, we construct \textbf{ShotQA}, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising approximately 70k cinematic QA pairs. Leveraging ShotQA, we develop \textbf{ShotVL} through supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization. ShotVL significantly outperforms all existing open-source and proprietary models on ShotBench, establishing new \textbf{state-of-the-art} performance. We open-source our models, data, and code to foster rapid progress in this crucial area of AI-driven cinematic understanding and generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D scene graphs provide a structural and explainable framework for scene understanding. However, current work still struggles with the lack of accurate scene graph data. To overcome this data bottleneck, we present CoPa-SG, a synthetic scene graph dataset with highly precise ground truth and exhaustive relation annotations between all objects. Moreover, we introduce parametric and proto-relations, two new fundamental concepts for scene graphs. The former provides a much more fine-grained representation than its traditional counterpart by enriching relations with additional parameters such as angles or distances. The latter encodes hypothetical relations in a scene graph and describes how relations would form if new objects are placed in the scene. Using CoPa-SG, we compare the performance of various scene graph generation models. We demonstrate how our new relation types can be integrated in downstream applications to enhance planning and reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>ToosiCubix: Monocular 3D Cuboid Labeling via Vehicle Part Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing methods for 3D cuboid annotation of vehicles rely on expensive and carefully calibrated camera-LiDAR or stereo setups, limiting their accessibility for large-scale data collection. We introduce ToosiCubix, a simple yet powerful approach for annotating ground-truth cuboids using only monocular images and intrinsic camera parameters. Our method requires only about 10 user clicks per vehicle, making it highly practical for adding 3D annotations to existing datasets originally collected without specialized equipment. By annotating specific features (e.g., wheels, car badge, symmetries) across different vehicle parts, we accurately estimate each vehicle's position, orientation, and dimensions up to a scale ambiguity (8 DoF). The geometric constraints are formulated as an optimization problem, which we solve using a coordinate descent strategy, alternating between Perspective-n-Points (PnP) and least-squares subproblems. To handle common ambiguities such as scale and unobserved dimensions, we incorporate probabilistic size priors, enabling 9 DoF cuboid placements. We validate our annotations against the KITTI and Cityscapes3D datasets, demonstrating that our method offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-quality 3D cuboid annotation.</description>

      <title>CA-I2P: Channel-Adaptive Registration Network with Global Optimal Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection-free methods typically follow a coarse-to-fine pipeline, extracting image and point cloud features for patch-level matching and refining dense pixel-to-point correspondences. However, differences in feature channel attention between images and point clouds may lead to degraded matching results, ultimately impairing registration accuracy. Furthermore, similar structures in the scene could lead to redundant correspondences in cross-modal matching. To address these issues, we propose Channel Adaptive Adjustment Module (CAA) and Global Optimal Selection Module (GOS). CAA enhances intra-modal features and suppresses cross-modal sensitivity, while GOS replaces local selection with global optimization. Experiments on RGB-D Scenes V2 and 7-Scenes demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image-to-point cloud registration.</description>

      <title>FastRef:Fast Prototype Refinement for Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot industrial anomaly detection (FS-IAD) presents a critical challenge for practical automated inspection systems operating in data-scarce environments. While existing approaches predominantly focus on deriving prototypes from limited normal samples, they typically neglect to systematically incorporate query image statistics to enhance prototype representativeness. To address this issue, we propose FastRef, a novel and efficient prototype refinement framework for FS-IAD. Our method operates through an iterative two-stage process: (1) characteristic transfer from query features to prototypes via an optimizable transformation matrix, and (2) anomaly suppression through prototype alignment. The characteristic transfer is achieved through linear reconstruction of query features from prototypes, while the anomaly suppression addresses a key observation in FS-IAD that unlike conventional IAD with abundant normal prototypes, the limited-sample setting makes anomaly reconstruction more probable. Therefore, we employ optimal transport (OT) for non-Gaussian sampled features to measure and minimize the gap between prototypes and their refined counterparts for anomaly suppression. For comprehensive evaluation, we integrate FastRef with three competitive prototype-based FS-IAD methods: PatchCore, FastRecon, WinCLIP, and AnomalyDINO. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets of MVTec, ViSA, MPDD and RealIAD demonstrate both the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our approach under 1/2/4-shots.</description>

      <title>Curve-Aware Gaussian Splatting for 3D Parametric Curve Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for reconstructing 3D parametric curves directly from multi-view edge maps. Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>XVerse: Consistent Multi-Subject Control of Identity and Semantic Attributes via DiT Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fine-grained control over subject identity and semantic attributes (pose, style, lighting) in text-to-image generation, particularly for multiple subjects, often undermines the editability and coherence of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Many approaches introduce artifacts or suffer from attribute entanglement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-subject controlled generation model XVerse. By transforming reference images into offsets for token-specific text-stream modulation, XVerse allows for precise and independent control for specific subject without disrupting image latents or features. Consequently, XVerse offers high-fidelity, editable multi-subject image synthesis with robust control over individual subject characteristics and semantic attributes. This advancement significantly improves personalized and complex scene generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>EndoFlow-SLAM: Real-Time Endoscopic SLAM with Flow-Constrained Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes. The source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <title>HyperSORT: Self-Organising Robust Training with hyper-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging datasets often contain heterogeneous biases ranging from erroneous labels to inconsistent labeling styles. Such biases can negatively impact deep segmentation networks performance. Yet, the identification and characterization of such biases is a particularly tedious and challenging task. In this paper, we introduce HyperSORT, a framework using a hyper-network predicting UNets' parameters from latent vectors representing both the image and annotation variability. The hyper-network parameters and the latent vector collection corresponding to each data sample from the training set are jointly learned. Hence, instead of optimizing a single neural network to fit a dataset, HyperSORT learns a complex distribution of UNet parameters where low density areas can capture noise-specific patterns while larger modes robustly segment organs in differentiated but meaningful manners. We validate our method on two 3D abdominal CT public datasets: first a synthetically perturbed version of the AMOS dataset, and TotalSegmentator, a large scale dataset containing real unknown biases and errors. Our experiments show that HyperSORT creates a structured mapping of the dataset allowing the identification of relevant systematic biases and erroneous samples. Latent space clusters yield UNet parameters performing the segmentation task in accordance with the underlying learned systematic bias. The code and our analysis of the TotalSegmentator dataset are made available: https://github.com/ImFusionGmbH/HyperSORT</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Learning and Vision Foundation Models for Atypical vs. Normal Mitosis Classification with Cross-Dataset Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atypical mitoses mark a deviation in the cell division process that can be an independent prognostically relevant marker for tumor malignancy. However, their identification remains challenging due to low prevalence, at times subtle morphological differences from normal mitoses, low inter-rater agreement among pathologists, and class imbalance in datasets. Building on the Atypical Mitosis dataset for Breast Cancer (AMi-Br), this study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparing deep learning approaches for automated atypical mitotic figure (AMF) classification, including baseline models, foundation models with linear probing, and foundation models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). For rigorous evaluation, we further introduce two new hold-out AMF datasets - AtNorM-Br, a dataset of mitoses from the The TCGA breast cancer cohort, and AtNorM-MD, a multi-domain dataset of mitoses from the MIDOG++ training set. We found average balanced accuracy values of up to 0.8135, 0.7696, and 0.7705 on the in-domain AMi-Br and the out-of-domain AtNorm-Br and AtNorM-MD datasets, respectively, with the results being particularly good for LoRA-based adaptation of the Virchow-line of foundation models. Our work shows that atypical mitosis classification, while being a challenging problem, can be effectively addressed through the use of recent advances in transfer learning and model fine-tuning techniques. We make available all code and data used in this paper in this github repository: https://github.com/DeepMicroscopy/AMi-Br_Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Controllable 3D Placement of Objects with Scene-Aware Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image editing approaches have become more powerful and flexible with the advent of powerful text-conditioned generative models. However, placing objects in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Dataset for Underground Miner Detection in Diverse Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground mining operations face significant safety challenges that make emergency response capabilities crucial. While robots have shown promise in assisting with search and rescue operations, their effectiveness depends on reliable miner detection capabilities. Deep learning algorithms offer potential solutions for automated miner detection, but require comprehensive training datasets, which are currently lacking for underground mining environments. This paper presents a novel thermal imaging dataset specifically designed to enable the development and validation of miner detection systems for potential emergency applications. We systematically captured thermal imagery of various mining activities and scenarios to create a robust foundation for detection algorithms. To establish baseline performance metrics, we evaluated several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms including YOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11, and RT-DETR on our dataset. While not exhaustive of all possible emergency situations, this dataset serves as a crucial first step toward developing reliable thermal-based miner detection systems that could eventually be deployed in real emergency scenarios. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using thermal imaging for miner detection and establishes a foundation for future research in this critical safety application.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Oversaturation in Classifier-Free Guidance via Low Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) succeeds in condition diffusion models that use a guidance scale to balance the influence of conditional and unconditional terms. A high guidance scale is used to enhance the performance of the conditional term. However, the high guidance scale often results in oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective based on low-frequency signals, identifying the accumulation of redundant information in these signals as the key factor behind oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. Building on this insight, we propose low-frequency improved classifier-free guidance (LF-CFG) to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive threshold-based measurement to pinpoint the locations of redundant information. We determine a reasonable threshold by analyzing the change rate of low-frequency information between prior and current steps. We then apply a down-weight strategy to reduce the impact of redundant information in the low-frequency signals. Experimental results demonstrate that LF-CFG effectively alleviates oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts across various diffusion models, including Stable Diffusion-XL, Stable Diffusion 2.1, 3.0, 3.5, and SiT-XL.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design, intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition, four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static, dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4 hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the hierarchical structure of data in vision-language models is a significant challenge. Previous works have attempted to address this challenge by employing entailment learning. However, these approaches fail to model the transitive nature of entailment explicitly, which establishes the relationship between order and semantics within a representation space. In this work, we introduce Radial Cross-Modal Embeddings (RCME), a framework that enables the explicit modeling of transitivity-enforced entailment. Our proposed framework optimizes for the partial order of concepts within vision-language models. By leveraging our framework, we develop a hierarchical vision-language foundation model capable of representing the hierarchy in the Tree of Life. Our experiments on hierarchical species classification and hierarchical retrieval tasks demonstrate the enhanced performance of our models compared to the existing state-of-the-art models. Our code and models are open-sourced at https://vishu26.github.io/RCME/index.html.</description>

      <title>TITAN: Query-Token based Domain Adaptive Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the source-free domain adaptive object detection (SF-DAOD) problem when source data is unavailable during adaptation and the model must adapt to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of approaches for the problem employ a self-supervised approach using a student-teacher (ST) framework where pseudo-labels are generated via a source-pretrained model for further fine-tuning. We observe that the performance of a student model often degrades drastically, due to the collapse of the teacher model, primarily caused by high noise in pseudo-labels, resulting from domain bias, discrepancies, and a significant domain shift across domains. To obtain reliable pseudo-labels, we propose a Target-based Iterative Query-Token Adversarial Network (TITAN), which separates the target images into two subsets: those similar to the source (easy) and those dissimilar (hard). We propose a strategy to estimate variance to partition the target domain. This approach leverages the insight that higher detection variances correspond to higher recall and greater similarity to the source domain. Also, we incorporate query-token-based adversarial modules into a student-teacher baseline framework to reduce the domain gaps between two feature representations. Experiments conducted on four natural imaging datasets and two challenging medical datasets have substantiated the superior performance of TITAN compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methodologies. We report an mAP improvement of +22.7, +22.2, +21.1, and +3.7 percent over the current SOTA on C2F, C2B, S2C, and K2C benchmarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Detection of Empty Space: Conditional Marked Point Processes for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have set the state-of-the-art in computer vision tasks such as bounding box detection and semantic segmentation. Object detectors and segmentation models assign confidence scores to predictions, reflecting the model's uncertainty in object detection or pixel-wise classification. However, these confidence estimates are often miscalibrated, as their architectures and loss functions are tailored to task performance rather than probabilistic foundation. Even with well calibrated predictions, object detectors fail to quantify uncertainty outside detected bounding boxes, i.e., the model does not make a probability assessment of whether an area without detected objects is truly free of obstacles. This poses a safety risk in applications such as automated driving, where uncertainty in empty areas remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an object detection model grounded in spatial statistics. Bounding box data matches realizations of a marked point process, commonly used to describe the probabilistic occurrence of spatial point events identified as bounding box centers, where marks are used to describe the spatial extension of bounding boxes and classes. Our statistical framework enables a likelihood-based training and provides well-defined confidence estimates for whether a region is drivable, i.e., free of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through calibration assessments and evaluation of performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Dynamic Logits Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in multimodal understanding, yet they are frequently hampered by hallucination-the generation of text that contradicts visual input. Existing training-free decoding strategies exhibit critical limitations, including the use of static constraints that do not adapt to semantic drift during generation, inefficiency stemming from the need for multiple forward passes, and degradation of detail due to overly rigid intervention rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Dynamic Logits Calibration (DLC), a novel training-free decoding framework designed to dynamically align text generation with visual evidence at inference time. At the decoding phase, DLC step-wise employs CLIP to assess the semantic alignment between the input image and the generated text sequence. Then, the Relative Visual Advantage (RVA) of candidate tokens is evaluated against a dynamically updated contextual baseline, adaptively adjusting output logits to favor tokens that are visually grounded. Furthermore, an adaptive weighting mechanism, informed by a real-time context alignment score, carefully balances the visual guidance while ensuring the overall quality of the textual output. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse benchmarks and various LVLM architectures (such as LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) demonstrate that DLC significantly reduces hallucinations, outperforming current methods while maintaining high inference efficiency by avoiding multiple forward passes. Overall, we present an effective and efficient decoding-time solution to mitigate hallucinations, thereby enhancing the reliability of LVLMs for more practices. Code will be released on Github.</description>

      <title>GGTalker: Talking Head Systhesis with Generalizable Gaussian Priors and Identity-Specific Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating high-quality, generalizable speech-driven 3D talking heads remains a persistent challenge. Previous methods achieve satisfactory results for fixed viewpoints and small-scale audio variations, but they struggle with large head rotations and out-of-distribution (OOD) audio. Moreover, they are constrained by the need for time-consuming, identity-specific training. We believe the core issue lies in the lack of sufficient 3D priors, which limits the extrapolation capabilities of synthesized talking heads. To address this, we propose GGTalker, which synthesizes talking heads through a combination of generalizable priors and identity-specific adaptation. We introduce a two-stage Prior-Adaptation training strategy to learn Gaussian head priors and adapt to individual characteristics. We train Audio-Expression and Expression-Visual priors to capture the universal patterns of lip movements and the general distribution of head textures. During the Customized Adaptation, individual speaking styles and texture details are precisely modeled. Additionally, we introduce a color MLP to generate fine-grained, motion-aligned textures and a Body Inpainter to blend rendered results with the background, producing indistinguishable, photorealistic video frames. Comprehensive experiments show that GGTalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering quality, 3D consistency, lip-sync accuracy, and training efficiency.</description>

      <title>G$^{2}$D: Boosting Multimodal Learning with Gradient-Guided Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to leverage information from diverse data modalities to achieve more comprehensive performance. However, conventional multimodal models often suffer from modality imbalance, where one or a few modalities dominate model optimization, leading to suboptimal feature representation and underutilization of weak modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce Gradient-Guided Distillation (G$^{2}$D), a knowledge distillation framework that optimizes the multimodal model with a custom-built loss function that fuses both unimodal and multimodal objectives. G$^{2}$D further incorporates a dynamic sequential modality prioritization (SMP) technique in the learning process to ensure each modality leads the learning process, avoiding the pitfall of stronger modalities overshadowing weaker ones. We validate G$^{2}$D on multiple real-world datasets and show that G$^{2}$D amplifies the significance of weak modalities while training and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression tasks.

      <title>MADrive: Memory-Augmented Driving Scene Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting. However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\sim}70$K 360{\deg} car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

      <title>WAFT: Warping-Alone Field Transforms for Optical Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs. Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring and KITTI benchmarks, achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster than methods with similar performance. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/WAFT.</description>

      <title>Maximal Matching Matters: Preventing Representation Collapse for Robust Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on MS-COCO and Flickr30k without relying on external data.</description>

      <title>StruMamba3D: Exploring Structural Mamba for Self-supervised Point Cloud Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods have demonstrated impressive performance in point cloud representation learning by leveraging State Space Model (SSM) with the efficient context modeling ability and linear complexity. However, these methods still face two key issues that limit the potential of SSM: Destroying the adjacency of 3D points during SSM processing and failing to retain long-sequence memory as the input length increases in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose StruMamba3D, a novel paradigm for self-supervised point cloud representation learning. It enjoys several merits. First, we design spatial states and use them as proxies to preserve spatial dependencies among points. Second, we enhance the SSM with a state-wise update strategy and incorporate a lightweight convolution to facilitate interactions between spatial states for efficient structure modeling. Third, our method reduces the sensitivity of pre-trained Mamba-based models to varying input lengths by introducing a sequence length-adaptive strategy. Experimental results across four downstream tasks showcase the superior performance of our method. In addition, our method attains the SOTA 95.1% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 92.75% accuracy on the most challenging split of ScanObjectNN without voting strategy.</description>

      <title>DeOcc-1-to-3: 3D De-Occlusion from a Single Image via Self-Supervised Multi-View Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a single image is a long-standing challenge, especially under real-world occlusions. While recent diffusion-based view synthesis models can generate consistent novel views from a single RGB image, they generally assume fully visible inputs and fail when parts of the object are occluded. This leads to inconsistent views and degraded 3D reconstruction quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end framework for occlusion-aware multi-view generation. Our method directly synthesizes six structurally consistent novel views from a single partially occluded image, enabling downstream 3D reconstruction without requiring prior inpainting or manual annotations. We construct a self-supervised training pipeline using the Pix2Gestalt dataset, leveraging occluded-unoccluded image pairs and pseudo-ground-truth views to teach the model structure-aware completion and view consistency. Without modifying the original architecture, we fully fine-tune the view synthesis model to jointly learn completion and multi-view generation. Additionally, we introduce the first benchmark for occlusion-aware reconstruction, encompassing diverse occlusion levels, object categories, and mask patterns. This benchmark provides a standardized protocol for evaluating future methods under partial occlusions. Our code is available at https://github.com/Quyans/DeOcc123.</description>

      <title>HalluSegBench: Counterfactual Visual Reasoning for Segmentation Hallucination Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language segmentation has significantly advanced grounded visual understanding. However, these models often exhibit hallucinations by producing segmentation masks for objects not grounded in the image content or by incorrectly labeling irrelevant regions. Existing evaluation protocols for segmentation hallucination primarily focus on label or textual hallucinations without manipulating the visual context, limiting their capacity to diagnose critical failures. In response, we introduce HalluSegBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual grounding through the lens of counterfactual visual reasoning. Our benchmark consists of a novel dataset of 1340 counterfactual instance pairs spanning 281 unique object classes, and a set of newly introduced metrics that quantify hallucination sensitivity under visually coherent scene edits. Experiments on HalluSegBench with state-of-the-art vision-language segmentation models reveal that vision-driven hallucinations are significantly more prevalent than label-driven ones, with models often persisting in false segmentation, highlighting the need for counterfactual reasoning to diagnose grounding fidelity.</description>

      <title>SAM4D: Segment Anything in Camera and LiDAR Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SAM4D, a multi-modal and temporal foundation model designed for promptable segmentation across camera and LiDAR streams. Unified Multi-modal Positional Encoding (UMPE) is introduced to align camera and LiDAR features in a shared 3D space, enabling seamless cross-modal prompting and interaction. Additionally, we propose Motion-aware Cross-modal Memory Attention (MCMA), which leverages ego-motion compensation to enhance temporal consistency and long-horizon feature retrieval, ensuring robust segmentation across dynamically changing autonomous driving scenes. To avoid annotation bottlenecks, we develop a multi-modal automated data engine that synergizes VFM-driven video masklets, spatiotemporal 4D reconstruction, and cross-modal masklet fusion. This framework generates camera-LiDAR aligned pseudo-labels at a speed orders of magnitude faster than human annotation while preserving VFM-derived semantic fidelity in point cloud representations. We conduct extensive experiments on the constructed Waymo-4DSeg, which demonstrate the powerful cross-modal segmentation ability and great potential in data annotation of proposed SAM4D.</description>

      <title>SiM3D: Single-instance Multiview Multimodal and Multisetup 3D Anomaly Detection Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume. Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.</description>

Abstract: We train models to Predict Ego-centric Video from human Actions (PEVA), given the past video and an action represented by the relative 3D body pose. By conditioning on kinematic pose trajectories, structured by the joint hierarchy of the body, our model learns to simulate how physical human actions shape the environment from a first-person point of view. We train an auto-regressive conditional diffusion transformer on Nymeria, a large-scale dataset of real-world egocentric video and body pose capture. We further design a hierarchical evaluation protocol with increasingly challenging tasks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the model's embodied prediction and control abilities. Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of modeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with video prediction from the perspective of a human.</description>

      <title>Global and Local Contrastive Learning for Joint Representations from Cardiac MRI and ECG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used, cost-effective tool for detecting electrical abnormalities in the heart. However, it cannot directly measure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed structural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To bridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive Learning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG representations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses global patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive loss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and CMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart embeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal alignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with corresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations with diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more insights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without introducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data from 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL achieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving patients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac function parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our results highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac diagnostics using ECG. The code is available at: https://github.com/alsalivan/ecgcmr</description>

      <title>U-R-VEDA: Integrating UNET, Residual Links, Edge and Dual Attention, and Vision Transformer for Accurate Semantic Segmentation of CMRs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, will play a transformative role in automated medical image analysis for the diagnosis of cardiac disorders and their management. Automated accurate delineation of cardiac images is the first necessary initial step for the quantification and automated diagnosis of cardiac disorders. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based enhanced UNet model, U-R-Veda, which integrates convolution transformations, vision transformer, residual links, channel-attention, and spatial attention, together with edge-detection based skip-connections for an accurate fully-automated semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The model extracts local-features and their interrelationships using a stack of combination convolution blocks, with embedded channel and spatial attention in the convolution block, and vision transformers. Deep embedding of channel and spatial attention in the convolution block identifies important features and their spatial localization. The combined edge information with channel and spatial attention as skip connection reduces information-loss during convolution transformations. The overall model significantly improves the semantic segmentation of CMR images necessary for improved medical image analysis. An algorithm for the dual attention module (channel and spatial attention) has been presented. Performance results show that U-R-Veda achieves an average accuracy of 95.2%, based on DSC metrics. The model outperforms the accuracy attained by other models, based on DSC and HD metrics, especially for the delineation of right-ventricle and left-ventricle-myocardium.</description>

      <title>Generative Blocks World: Moving Things Around in Pictures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Generative Blocks World to interact with the scene of a generated image by manipulating simple geometric abstractions. Our method represents scenes as assemblies of convex 3D primitives, and the same scene can be represented by different numbers of primitives, allowing an editor to move either whole structures or small details. Once the scene geometry has been edited, the image is generated by a flow-based method which is conditioned on depth and a texture hint. Our texture hint takes into account the modified 3D primitives, exceeding texture-consistency provided by existing key-value caching techniques. These texture hints (a) allow accurate object and camera moves and (b) largely preserve the identity of objects depicted. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior works in visual fidelity, editability, and compositional generalization.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized, significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier points as valid conductors measurements.</description>

      <title>Universal and Efficient Detection of Adversarial Data through Nonuniform Impact on Network Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial input designs with limited noise budgets. While numerous successful attacks with subtle modifications to original input have been proposed, defense techniques against these attacks are relatively understudied. Existing defense approaches either focus on improving DNN robustness by negating the effects of perturbations or use a secondary model to detect adversarial data. Although equally important, the attack detection approach, which is studied in this work, provides a more practical defense compared to the robustness approach. We show that the existing detection methods are either ineffective against the state-of-the-art attack techniques or computationally inefficient for real-time processing. We propose a novel universal and efficient method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the varying degrees of impact of attacks on different DNN layers. {Our method trains a lightweight regression model that predicts deeper-layer features from early-layer features, and uses the prediction error to detect adversarial samples.} Through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our detection method is highly effective, computationally efficient for real-time processing, compatible with any DNN architecture, and applicable across different domains, such as image, video, and audio.</description>

      <title>3DGH: 3D Head Generation with Composable Hair and Face</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 3DGH, an unconditional generative model for 3D human heads with composable hair and face components. Unlike previous work that entangles the modeling of hair and face, we propose to separate them using a novel data representation with template-based 3D Gaussian Splatting, in which deformable hair geometry is introduced to capture the geometric variations across different hairstyles. Based on this data representation, we design a 3D GAN-based architecture with dual generators and employ a cross-attention mechanism to model the inherent correlation between hair and face. The model is trained on synthetic renderings using carefully designed objectives to stabilize training and facilitate hair-face separation. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the design choice of 3DGH, and evaluate it both qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing with several state-of-the-art 3D GAN methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in unconditional full-head image synthesis and composable 3D hairstyle editing. More details will be available on our project page: https://c-he.github.io/projects/3dgh/.</description>

      <title>Development of MR spectral analysis method robust against static magnetic field inhomogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose:To develop a method that enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis in the presence of static magnetic field B0 inhomogeneity. Methods:The authors proposed a new spectral analysis method utilizing a deep learning model trained on modeled spectra that consistently represent the spectral variations induced by B0 inhomogeneity. These modeled spectra were generated from the B0 map and metabolite ratios of the healthy human brain. The B0 map was divided into a patch size of subregions, and the separately estimated metabolites and baseline components were averaged and then integrated. The quality of the modeled spectra was visually and quantitatively evaluated against the measured spectra. The analysis models were trained using measured, simulated, and modeled spectra. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using mean squared errors (MSEs) of metabolite ratios. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the metabolite ratios were also compared to LCModel when analyzing the phantom spectra acquired under two types of B0 inhomogeneity. Results:The modeled spectra exhibited broadened and narrowed spectral peaks depending on the B0 inhomogeneity and were quantitatively close to the measured spectra. The analysis model trained using measured spectra with modeled spectra improved MSEs by 49.89% compared to that trained using measured spectra alone, and by 26.66% compared to that trained using measured spectra with simulated spectra. The performance improved as the number of modeled spectra increased from 0 to 1,000. This model showed significantly lower MAPEs than LCModel under both types of B0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion:A new spectral analysis-trained deep learning model using the modeled spectra was developed. The results suggest that the proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy of spectral analysis by increasing the training samples of spectra.</description>

      <title>Consistent Zero-shot 3D Texture Synthesis Using Geometry-aware Diffusion and Temporal Video Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current texture synthesis methods, which generate textures from fixed viewpoints, suffer from inconsistencies due to the lack of global context and geometric understanding. Meanwhile, recent advancements in video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in achieving temporally consistent videos. In this paper, we introduce VideoTex, a novel framework for seamless texture synthesis that leverages video generation models to address both spatial and temporal inconsistencies in 3D textures. Our approach incorporates geometry-aware conditions, enabling precise utilization of 3D mesh structures. Additionally, we propose a structure-wise UV diffusion strategy, which enhances the generation of occluded areas by preserving semantic information, resulting in smoother and more coherent textures. VideoTex not only achieves smoother transitions across UV boundaries but also ensures high-quality, temporally stable textures across video frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoTex outperforms existing methods in texture fidelity, seam blending, and stability, paving the way for dynamic real-time applications that demand both visual quality and temporal coherence.</description>

      <title>ThermalDiffusion: Visual-to-Thermal Image-to-Image Translation for Autonomous Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them. However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of real-world objects.</description>

      <title>SharpZO: Hybrid Sharpness-Aware Vision Language Model Prompt Tuning via Forward-Only Passes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning vision language models (VLMs) has achieved remarkable performance across various downstream tasks; yet, it requires access to model gradients through backpropagation (BP), making them unsuitable for memory-constrained, inference-only edge devices. To address this limitation, previous work has explored various BP-free fine-tuning methods. However, these approaches often rely on high-variance evolutionary strategies (ES) or zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, and often fail to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Sharpness-aware Zeroth-order optimization (SharpZO) approach, specifically designed to enhance the performance of ZO VLM fine-tuning via a sharpness-aware warm-up training. SharpZO features a two-stage optimization process: a sharpness-aware ES stage that globally explores and smooths the loss landscape to construct a strong initialization, followed by a fine-grained local search via sparse ZO optimization. The entire optimization relies solely on forward passes. Detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on CLIP models demonstrate that SharpZO significantly improves accuracy and convergence speed, achieving up to 7% average gain over state-of-the-art forward-only methods.</description>

      <title>RL-Selector: Reinforcement Learning-Guided Data Selection via Redundancy Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep architectures often rely on large-scale datasets, but training on these datasets incurs high computational and storage overhead. Real-world datasets often contain substantial redundancies, prompting the need for more data-efficient training paradigms. Data selection has shown promise to mitigate redundancy by identifying the most representative samples, thereby reducing training costs without compromising performance. Existing methods typically rely on static scoring metrics or pretrained models, overlooking the combined effect of selected samples and their evolving dynamics during training. We introduce the concept of epsilon-sample cover, which quantifies sample redundancy based on inter-sample relationships, capturing the intrinsic structure of the dataset. Based on this, we reformulate data selection as a reinforcement learning (RL) process and propose RL-Selector, where a lightweight RL agent optimizes the selection policy by leveraging epsilon-sample cover derived from evolving dataset distribution as a reward signal. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse architectures demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Models trained with our selected datasets show enhanced generalization performance with improved training efficiency.</description>

      <title>V2X-REALM: Vision-Language Model-Based Robust End-to-End Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Long-Tail Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning, safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions, advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Personalized Federated Learning via Dual-Prompt Optimization and Cross Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing local data, but is challenged by heterogeneity in data, computation, and communication. Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), with their strong generalization and lightweight tuning via prompts, offer a promising solution. However, existing federated prompt-learning methods rely only on text prompts and overlook joint label-domain distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a personalized FL framework based on dual-prompt learning and cross fusion, termed pFedDC. Specifically, each client maintains both global and local prompts across vision and language modalities: global prompts capture common knowledge shared across the federation, while local prompts encode client-specific semantics and domain characteristics. Meanwhile, a cross-fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate prompts from different levels, enabling the model to generate personalized representations aligned with each client's unique data distribution. Extensive experiments across nine datasets with various types of heterogeneity show that pFedDC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Uncover Treasures in DCT: Advancing JPEG Quality Enhancement by Exploiting Latent Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) achieves data compression by quantizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients, which inevitably introduces compression artifacts. Most existing JPEG quality enhancement methods operate in the pixel domain, suffering from the high computational costs of decoding. Consequently, direct enhancement of JPEG images in the DCT domain has gained increasing attention. However, current DCT-domain methods often exhibit limited performance. To address this challenge, we identify two critical types of correlations within the DCT coefficients of JPEG images. Building on this insight, we propose an Advanced DCT-domain JPEG Quality Enhancement (AJQE) method that fully exploits these correlations. The AJQE method enables the adaptation of numerous well-established pixel-domain models to the DCT domain, achieving superior performance with reduced computational complexity. Compared to the pixel-domain counterparts, the DCT-domain models derived by our method demonstrate a 0.35 dB improvement in PSNR and a 60.5% increase in enhancement throughput on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for brain tumor segmentation leveraging pre-trained GANs and Unet architectures. By combining a global anomaly detection module with a refined mask generation network, the proposed model accurately identifies tumor-sensitive regions and iteratively enhances segmentation precision using adversarial loss constraints. Multi-modal MRI data and synthetic image augmentation are employed to improve robustness and address the challenge of limited annotated datasets. Experimental results on the BraTS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high sensitivity and accuracy in both lesion-wise Dice and HD95 metrics than the baseline. This scalable method minimizes the dependency on fully annotated data, paving the way for practical real-world applications in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings, character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful, narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for personalized and engaging story animation.

      <description>arXiv:2506.21319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizations are crucial for data communication, yet understanding them requires comprehension of both visual elements and their underlying data relationships. Current multimodal large models, while effective in natural image understanding, struggle with visualization due to their inability to decode the data-to-visual mapping rules and extract structured information. To address these challenges, we present a novel dataset and train multimodal visualization LLMs specifically designed for understanding. Our approach combines chart images with their corresponding vectorized representations, encoding schemes, and data features. The proposed vector format enables compact and accurate reconstruction of visualization content. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both data extraction accuracy and chart reconstruction quality.</description>

      <title>Automatic Reviewers Assignment to a Research Paper Based on Allied References and Publications Weight</title>

Abstract: Everyday, a vast stream of research documents is submitted to conferences, anthologies, journals, newsletters, annual reports, daily papers, and various periodicals. Many such publications use independent external specialists to review submissions. This process is called peer review, and the reviewers are called referees. However, it is not always possible to pick the best referee for reviewing. Moreover, new research fields are emerging in every sector, and the number of research papers is increasing dramatically. To review all these papers, every journal assigns a small team of referees who may not be experts in all areas. For example, a research paper in communication technology should be reviewed by an expert from the same field. Thus, efficiently selecting the best reviewer or referee for a research paper is a big challenge.
  In this research, we propose and implement program that uses a new strategy to automatically select the best reviewers for a research paper. Every research paper contains references at the end, usually from the same area. First, we collect the references and count authors who have at least one paper in the references. Then, we automatically browse the web to extract research topic keywords. Next, we search for top researchers in the specific topic and count their h-index, i10-index, and citations for the first n authors. Afterward, we rank the top n authors based on a score and automatically browse their homepages to retrieve email addresses. We also check their co-authors and colleagues online and discard them from the list. The remaining top n authors, generally professors, are likely the best referees for reviewing the research paper.</description>

      <title>ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models for Audio Generation and Editing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present \textbf{ThinkSound}, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{AudioCoT}, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark.

      <title>Spatial Mental Modeling from Limited Views</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance. Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations (perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for "what-if" movements). We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains, and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic approach, "map-then-reason", that jointly trains the model to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of unobservable space.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Physics-Informed Zero-Shot Ultrasound Plane Wave Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound Coherent Plane Wave Compounding (CPWC) enhances image contrast by combining echoes from multiple steered transmissions. While increasing the number of angles generally improves image quality, it drastically reduces the frame rate and can introduce blurring artifacts in fast-moving targets. Moreover, compounded images remain susceptible to noise, particularly when acquired with a limited number of transmissions. We propose a zero-shot denoising framework tailored for low-angle CPWC acquisitions, which enhances contrast without relying on a separate training dataset. The method divides the available transmission angles into two disjoint subsets, each used to form compound images that include higher noise levels. The new compounded images are then used to train a deep model via a self-supervised residual learning scheme, enabling it to suppress incoherent noise while preserving anatomical structures. Because angle-dependent artifacts vary between the subsets while the underlying tissue response is similar, this physics-informed pairing allows the network to learn to disentangle the inconsistent artifacts from the consistent tissue signal. Unlike supervised methods, our model requires no domain-specific fine-tuning or paired data, making it adaptable across anatomical regions and acquisition setups. The entire pipeline supports efficient training with low computational cost due to the use of a lightweight architecture, which comprises only two convolutional layers. Evaluations on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data demonstrate superior contrast enhancement and structure preservation compared to both classical and deep learning-based denoising methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Design Space of 3D MLLMs for CT Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10\%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution</description>

Abstract: Research in quantum machine learning has recently proliferated due to the potential of quantum computing to accelerate machine learning. An area of machine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to improve the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary differential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog Rydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also introduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom quantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using analog quantum neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Image Generation with Variadic Attention Heads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the integration of transformers in vision models have yielded significant improvements on vision tasks they still require significant amounts of computation for both training and inference. Restricted attention mechanisms significantly reduce these computational burdens but come at the cost of losing either global or local coherence. We propose a simple, yet powerful method to reduce these trade-offs: allow the attention heads of a single transformer to attend to multiple receptive fields.
  We demonstrate our method utilizing Neighborhood Attention (NA) and integrate it into a StyleGAN based architecture for image generation. With this work, dubbed StyleNAT, we are able to achieve a FID of 2.05 on FFHQ, a 6% improvement over StyleGAN-XL, while utilizing 28% fewer parameters and with 4$\times$ the throughput capacity. StyleNAT achieves the Pareto Frontier on FFHQ-256 and demonstrates powerful and efficient image generation on other datasets. Our code and model checkpoints are publicly available at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/StyleNAT</description>

      <title>A Multi-Source Data Fusion-based Semantic Segmentation Model for Relic Landslide Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01251v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a natural disaster, landslide often brings tremendous losses to human lives, so it urgently demands reliable detection of landslide risks. When detecting relic landslides that present important information for landslide risk warning, problems such as visual blur and small-sized dataset cause great challenges when using remote sensing images. To extract accurate semantic features, a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) is proposed, which augments the local salient feature extraction from boundaries of landslides through HPCL and fuses heterogeneous information in the semantic space from high-resolution remote sensing images and digital elevation model data. For full utilization of precious samples, a global hyper-pixel-wise sample pair queues-based contrastive learning method is developed, which includes the construction of global queues that store hyper-pixel-wise samples and the updating scheme of a momentum encoder, reliably enhancing the extraction ability of semantic features. The proposed HPCL-Net is evaluated on the Loess Plateau relic landslide dataset and experimental results verify that the proposed HPCL-Net greatly outperforms existing models, where the mIoU is increased from 0.620 to 0.651, the Landslide IoU is improved from 0.334 to 0.394 and the F1score is enhanced from 0.501 to 0.565.</description>

      <title>QuEST: Low-bit Diffusion Model Quantization via Efficient Selective Finetuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical deployment of diffusion models is still hindered by the high memory and computational overhead. Although quantization paves a way for model compression and acceleration, existing methods face challenges in achieving low-bit quantization efficiently. In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</description>

      <title>Is my Data in your AI Model? Membership Inference Test with Application to Face Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>Self-Regulated Neurogenesis for Online Data-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning sequences of tasks or data streams, unlike humans who can continuously learn and consolidate new concepts even in the absence of explicit cues. Online data-incremental learning seeks to emulate this capability by processing each sample only once, without having access to task or stream cues at any point in time since this is more realistic compared to offline setups, where all data from novel class(es) is assumed to be readily available. However, existing methods typically rely on storing the subsets of data in memory or expanding the initial model architecture, resulting in significant computational overhead. Drawing inspiration from 'self-regulated neurogenesis'-brain's mechanism for creating specialized regions or circuits for distinct functions-we propose a novel approach SERENA which encodes each concept in a specialized network path called 'concept cell', integrated into a single over-parameterized network. Once a concept is learned, its corresponding concept cell is frozen, effectively preventing the forgetting of previously acquired information. Furthermore, we introduce two new continual learning scenarios that more closely reflect real-world conditions, characterized by gradually changing sample sizes. Experimental results show that our method not only establishes new state-of-the-art results across ten benchmarks but also remarkably surpasses offline supervised batch learning performance.

      <title>Cell Tracking according to Biological Needs -- Strong Mitosis-aware Multi-Hypothesis Tracker with Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell tracking and segmentation assist biologists in extracting insights from large-scale microscopy time-lapse data. Driven by local accuracy metrics, current tracking approaches often suffer from a lack of long-term consistency and the ability to reconstruct lineage trees correctly. To address this issue, we introduce an uncertainty estimation technique for motion estimation frameworks and extend the multi-hypothesis tracking framework. Our uncertainty estimation lifts motion representations into probabilistic spatial densities using problem-specific test-time augmentations. Moreover, we introduce a novel mitosis-aware assignment problem formulation that allows multi-hypothesis trackers to model cell splits and to resolve false associations and mitosis detections based on long-term conflicts. In our framework, explicit biological knowledge is modeled in assignment costs. We evaluate our approach on nine competitive datasets and demonstrate that we outperform the current state-of-the-art on biologically inspired metrics substantially, achieving improvements by a factor of approximately 6 and uncover new insights into the behavior of motion estimation uncertainty.</description>

      <title>What Do You See? Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15668v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. Using multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average, for ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 6.2 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods re-evaluated with the same setup. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>ClimateIQA: A New Dataset and Benchmark to Advance Vision-Language Models in Meteorology Anomalies Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meteorological heatmaps play a vital role in deciphering extreme weather phenomena, yet their inherent complexities marked by irregular contours, unstructured patterns, and complex color variations present unique analytical hurdles for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o, Qwen-VL, and LLaVA 1.6 struggle with tasks such as precise color identification and spatial localization, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparse Position and Outline Tracking (SPOT), a novel algorithm specifically designed to process irregularly shaped colored regions in visual data. SPOT identifies and localizes these regions by extracting their spatial coordinates, enabling structured representations of irregular shapes. Building on SPOT, we construct ClimateIQA, a novel meteorological visual question answering (VQA) dataset, comprising 26,280 high-resolution heatmaps and 762,120 instruction samples for wind gust, total precipitation, wind chill index and heat index analysis. ClimateIQA enhances VLM training by incorporating spatial cues, geographic metadata, and reanalysis data, improving model accuracy in interpreting and describing extreme weather features. Furthermore, we develop Climate-Zoo, a suite of fine-tuned VLMs based on SPOT-empowered ClimateIQA, which significantly outperforms existing models in meteorological heatmap tasks.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Massive Satellite Imagery with Efficient Masked Image Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11933v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has become an essential method for building foundational visual models in remote sensing (RS). However, the limitations in size and diversity of existing RS datasets restrict the ability of MIM methods to learn generalizable representations. Additionally, conventional MIM techniques, which require reconstructing all tokens, introduce unnecessary computational overhead. To address these issues, we present a new pre-training pipeline for RS models, featuring the creation of a large-scale RS dataset and an efficient MIM approach. We curated a high-quality dataset named \textbf{OpticalRS-13M} by collecting publicly available RS datasets and processing them through exclusion, slicing, and deduplication. OpticalRS-13M comprises 13 million optical images covering various RS tasks, such as object detection and pixel segmentation. To enhance efficiency, we propose \textbf{SelectiveMAE}, a pre-training method that dynamically encodes and reconstructs semantically rich patch tokens, thereby reducing the inefficiencies of traditional MIM models caused by redundant background pixels in RS images. Extensive experiments show that OpticalRS-13M significantly improves classification, detection, and segmentation performance, while SelectiveMAE increases training efficiency over 2$\times$ times. This highlights the effectiveness and scalability of our pipeline in developing RS foundational models. The dataset, source code, and trained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/SelectiveMAE.</description>

      <title>CanFields: Consolidating Diffeomorphic Flows for Non-Rigid 4D Interpolation from Arbitrary-Length Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Canonical Consolidation Fields (CanFields). This novel method interpolates arbitrary-length sequences of independently sampled 3D point clouds into a unified, continuous, and coherent deforming shape. Unlike prior methods that oversmooth geometry or produce topological and geometric artifacts, CanFields optimizes fine-detailed geometry and deformation jointly in an unsupervised fitting with two novel bespoke modules. First, we introduce a dynamic consolidator module that adjusts the input and assigns confidence scores, balancing the optimization of the canonical shape and its motion. Second, we represent the motion as a diffeomorphic flow parameterized by a smooth velocity field. We have validated our robustness and accuracy on more than 50 diverse sequences, demonstrating its superior performance even with missing regions, noisy raw scans, and sparse data.

      <title>Learning to Be a Transformer to Pinpoint Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04092v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To efficiently deploy strong, often pre-trained feature extractors, recent Industrial Anomaly Detection and Segmentation (IADS) methods process low-resolution images, e.g., 224x224 pixels, obtained by downsampling the original input images. However, while numerous industrial applications demand the identification of both large and small defects, downsampling the input image to a low resolution may hinder a method's ability to pinpoint tiny anomalies. We propose a novel Teacher--Student paradigm to leverage strong pre-trained features while processing high-resolution input images very efficiently. The core idea concerns training two shallow MLPs (the Students) by nominal images so as to mimic the mappings between the patch embeddings induced by the self-attention layers of a frozen vision Transformer (the Teacher). Indeed, learning these mappings sets forth a challenging pretext task that small-capacity models are unlikely to accomplish on out-of-distribution data such as anomalous images. Our method can spot anomalies from high-resolution images and runs way faster than competitors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MVTec AD and the best segmentation results on VisA. We also propose novel evaluation metrics to capture robustness to defect size, i.e., the ability to preserve good localisation from large anomalies to tiny ones. Evaluating our method also by these metrics reveals its neatly superior performance.</description>

      <title>HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents unique challenges that extend beyond traditional short-video analysis approaches, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies, processing redundant information efficiently, and extracting high-level semantic concepts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that more accurately reflects human cognition. This paper introduces HERMES: temporal-coHERent long-forM understanding with Episodes and Semantics, featuring two versatile modules that can enhance existing video-language models or operate as a standalone system. Our Episodic COmpressor (ECO) efficiently aggregates representations from micro to semi-macro levels, reducing computational overhead while preserving temporal dependencies. Our Semantics ReTRiever (SeTR) enriches these representations with semantic information by focusing on broader context, dramatically reducing feature dimensionality while preserving relevant macro-level information. We demonstrate that these modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing SOTA models, consistently improving their performance while reducing inference latency by up to 43% and memory usage by 46%. As a standalone system, HERMES achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video understanding benchmarks in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings.</description>

      <title>Tackling fluffy clouds: robust field boundary delineation across global agricultural landscapes with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate delineation of agricultural field boundaries is essential for effective crop monitoring and resource management. However, competing methodologies often face significant challenges, particularly in their reliance on extensive manual efforts for cloud-free data curation and limited adaptability to diverse global conditions. In this paper, we introduce PTAViT3D, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for processing three-dimensional time series of satellite imagery from either Sentinel-1 (S1) or Sentinel-2 (S2). Additionally, we present PTAViT3D-CA, an extension of the PTAViT3D model incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to fuse S1 and S2 datasets, enhancing robustness in cloud-contaminated scenarios. The proposed methods leverage spatio-temporal correlations through a memory-efficient 3D Vision Transformer architecture, facilitating accurate boundary delineation directly from raw, cloud-contaminated imagery. We comprehensively validate our models through extensive testing on various datasets, including Australia's ePaddocks - CSIRO's national agricultural field boundary product - alongside public benchmarks Fields-of-the-World, PASTIS, and AI4SmallFarms. Our results consistently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting excellent global transferability and robustness. Crucially, our approach significantly simplifies data preparation workflows by reliably processing cloud-affected imagery, thereby offering strong adaptability across diverse agricultural environments. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/feevos/tfcl.</description>

      <title>ToMiE: Towards Explicit Exoskeleton for the Reconstruction of Complicated 3D Human Avatars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we highlight a critical yet often overlooked factor in most 3D human tasks, namely modeling complicated 3D human with with hand-held objects or loose-fitting clothing. It is known that the parameterized formulation of SMPL is able to fit human skin; while hand-held objects and loose-fitting clothing, are difficult to get modeled within the unified framework, since their movements are usually decoupled with the human body. To enhance the capability of SMPL skeleton in response to this situation, we propose a growth strategy that enables the joint tree of the skeleton to expand adaptively. Specifically, our method, called ToMiE, consists of parent joints localization and external joints optimization. For parent joints localization, we employ a gradient-based approach guided by both LBS blending weights and motion kernels. Once the external joints are obtained, we proceed to optimize their transformations in SE(3) across different frames, enabling rendering and explicit animation. ToMiE manages to outperform other methods across various cases with hand-held objects and loose-fitting clothing, not only in rendering quality but also by offering free animation of grown joints, thereby enhancing the expressive ability of SMPL skeleton for a broader range of applications.</description>

      <title>ROA-BEV: 2D Region-Oriented Attention for BEV-based 3D Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) 3D object detection has recently become popular in autonomous driving. However, objects with a high similarity to the background from a camera perspective cannot be detected well by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a BEV-based 3D Object Detection Network with 2D Region-Oriented Attention (ROA-BEV), which enables the backbone to focus more on feature learning of the regions where objects exist. Moreover, our method further enhances the information feature learning ability of ROA through multi-scale structures. Each block of ROA utilizes a large kernel to ensure that the receptive field is large enough to catch information about large objects. Experiments on nuScenes show that ROA-BEV improves the performance based on BEVDepth. The source codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/DFLyan/ROA-BEV.</description>

      <title>Advanced computer vision for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from drone imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for extracting georeferenced vehicle trajectories from high-altitude drone imagery, addressing key challenges in urban traffic monitoring and the limitations of traditional ground-based systems. Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator has established itself in the field of non-rigid shape analysis due to its many useful properties such as being invariant under isometric transformation, having a countable eigensystem forming an orthornormal basis, and fully characterizing geodesic distances of the manifold. However, this invariancy only applies under isometric deformations, which leads to a performance breakdown in many real-world applications. In recent years emphasis has been placed upon extracting optimal features using deep learning methods,however spectral signatures play a crucial role and still add value. In this paper we take a step back, revisiting the LBO and proposing a supervised way to learn several operators on a manifold. Depending on the task, by applying these functions, we can train the LBO eigenbasis to be more task-specific. The optimization of the LBO leads to enormous improvements to established descriptors such as the heat kernel signature in various tasks such as retrieval, classification, segmentation, and correspondence, proving the adaption of the LBO eigenbasis to both global and highly local learning settings.</description>

      <title>Recall and Refine: A Simple but Effective Source-free Open-set Domain Adaptation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where novel classes - also referred to as target-private unknown classes - are present. Source-free Open-set Domain Adaptation (SF-OSDA) methods address OSDA without accessing labeled source data, making them particularly relevant under privacy constraints. However, SF-OSDA presents significant challenges due to distribution shifts and the introduction of novel classes. Existing SF-OSDA methods typically rely on thresholding the prediction entropy of a sample to identify it as either a known or unknown class, but fail to explicitly learn discriminative features for the target-private unknown classes. We propose Recall and Refine (RRDA), a novel SF-OSDA framework designed to address these limitations by explicitly learning features for target-private unknown classes. RRDA employs a two-stage process. First, we enhance the model's capacity to recognize unknown classes by training a target classifier with an additional decision boundary,guided by synthetic samples generated from target domain features. This enables the classifier to effectively separate known and unknown classes. Second, we adapt the entire model to the target domain, addressing both domain shifts and distinguishability to unknown classes. Any off-the-shelf source-free domain adaptation method (e.g. SHOT, AaD) can be seamlessly integrated into our framework at this stage. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RRDA significantly outperforms existing SF-OSDA and OSDA methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing foundation models largely break away from the traditional paradigm of designing task-specific models, offering greater scalability across multiple tasks. However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CT report generation (CTRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports for 3D volumes, relieving clinicians' workload and improving patient care. Despite clinical value, existing works fail to effectively incorporate diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views and lack related clinical expertise essential for accurate and reliable diagnosis. To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-view perception Knowledge-enhanced TansfoRmer (MvKeTR) to mimic the diagnostic workflow of clinicians. Just as radiologists first examine CT scans from multiple planes, a Multi-View Perception Aggregator (MVPA) with view-aware attention is proposed to synthesize diagnostic information from multiple anatomical views effectively. Then, inspired by how radiologists further refer to relevant clinical records to guide diagnostic decision-making, a Cross-Modal Knowledge Enhancer (CMKE) is devised to retrieve the most similar reports based on the query volume to incorporate domain knowledge into the diagnosis procedure. Furthermore, instead of traditional MLPs, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as the fundamental building blocks of both modules, which exhibit superior parameter efficiency and reduced spectral bias to better capture high-frequency components critical for CT interpretation while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on the public CTRG-Chest-548 K dataset demonstrate that our method outpaces prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across almost all metrics.

      <description>arXiv:2412.01787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent generative models based on score matching and flow matching have significantly advanced generation tasks, but their potential in discriminative tasks remains underexplored. Previous approaches, such as generative classifiers, have not fully leveraged the capabilities of these models for discriminative tasks due to their intricate designs. We propose Pretrained Reversible Generation (PRG), which extracts unsupervised representations by reversing the generative process of a pretrained continuous generation model. PRG effectively reuses unsupervised generative models, leveraging their high capacity to serve as robust and generalizable feature extractors for downstream tasks. This framework enables the flexible selection of feature hierarchies tailored to specific downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among generative model based methods, including 78% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet at a resolution of 64*64. Extensive ablation studies, including out-of-distribution evaluations, further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/opendilab/PRG.</description>

In contrast, we leverage the recent advancements in scalable 3D representation and video models to achieve large dynamic scene generation that allows flexible controls through HD maps, vehicle bounding boxes, and text descriptions. First, we construct a map-conditioned sparse-voxel-based 3D generative model to unleash its power for unbounded voxel world generation. Then, we re-purpose a video model and ground it on the voxel world through a set of carefully designed pixel-aligned guidance buffers, synthesizing a consistent appearance. Finally, we propose a fast feed-forward approach that employs both voxel and pixel branches to lift the dynamic videos to dynamic 3D Gaussians with controllable objects. Our method can generate controllable and realistic 3D driving scenes, and extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of our model.</description>

      <title>SIDA: Social Media Image Deepfake Detection, Localization and Explanation with Large Multimodal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>Mr. DETR++: Instructive Multi-Route Training for Detection Transformers with Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10028v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing methods enhance the training of detection transformers by incorporating an auxiliary one-to-many assignment. In this work, we treat the model as a multi-task framework, simultaneously performing one-to-one and one-to-many predictions. We investigate the roles of each component in the transformer decoder across these two training targets, including self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward network. Our empirical results demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can effectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are shared. This finding leads us to propose a multi-route training mechanism, featuring a primary route for one-to-one prediction and two auxiliary training routes for one-to-many prediction. We propose a novel instructive self-attention mechanism, integrated into the first auxiliary route, which dynamically and flexibly guides object queries for one-to-many prediction. For the second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between routes. Additionally, we apply an MoE to low-scale features in the encoder, optimizing the balance between efficiency and effectiveness. The auxiliary routes are discarded during inference. We conduct extensive experiments across various object detection baselines, achieving consistent improvements as demonstrated in Fig. 1. Our method is highly flexible and can be readily adapted to other tasks. To demonstrate its versatility, we conduct experiments on both instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness.

      <title>Rethinking Detecting Salient and Camouflaged Objects in Unconstrained Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the human visual system employs distinct mechanisms to perceive salient and camouflaged objects, existing models struggle to disentangle these tasks. Specifically, salient object detection (SOD) models frequently misclassify camouflaged objects as salient, while camouflaged object detection (COD) models conversely misinterpret salient objects as camouflaged. We hypothesize that this can be attributed to two factors: (i) the specific annotation paradigm of current SOD and COD datasets, and (ii) the lack of explicit attribute relationship modeling in current models. Prevalent SOD/COD datasets enforce a mutual exclusivity constraint, assuming scenes contain either salient or camouflaged objects, which poorly aligns with the real world. Furthermore, current SOD/COD methods are primarily designed for these highly constrained datasets and lack explicit modeling of the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects. In this paper, to promote the development of unconstrained salient and camouflaged object detection, we construct a large-scale dataset, USC12K, which features comprehensive labels and four different scenes that cover all possible logical existence scenarios of both salient and camouflaged objects. To explicitly model the relationship between salient and camouflaged objects, we propose a model called USCNet, which introduces two distinct prompt query mechanisms for modeling inter-sample and intra-sample attribute relationships. Additionally, to assess the model's ability to distinguish between salient and camouflaged objects, we design an evaluation metric called CSCS. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all scenes in various metrics. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/ssecv/USCNet.</description>

      <title>SweepEvGS: Event-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting for Macro and Micro Radiance Field Rendering from a Single Sweep</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have demonstrated the potential of using 3D Gaussian primitives for high-speed, high-fidelity, and cost-efficient novel view synthesis from continuously calibrated input views. However, conventional methods require high-frame-rate dense and high-quality sharp images, which are time-consuming and inefficient to capture, especially in dynamic environments. Event cameras, with their high temporal resolution and ability to capture asynchronous brightness changes, offer a promising alternative for more reliable scene reconstruction without motion blur. In this paper, we propose SweepEvGS, a novel hardware-integrated method that leverages event cameras for robust and accurate novel view synthesis across various imaging settings from a single sweep. SweepEvGS utilizes the initial static frame with dense event streams captured during a single camera sweep to effectively reconstruct detailed scene views. We also introduce different real-world hardware imaging systems for real-world data collection and evaluation for future research. We validate the robustness and efficiency of SweepEvGS through experiments in three different imaging settings: synthetic objects, real-world macro-level, and real-world micro-level view synthesis. Our results demonstrate that SweepEvGS surpasses existing methods in visual rendering quality, rendering speed, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for dynamic practical applications.</description>

      <title>Materialist: Physically Based Editing Using Single-Image Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving physically consistent image editing remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Existing image editing methods typically rely on neural networks, which struggle to accurately handle shadows and refractions. Conversely, physics-based inverse rendering often requires multi-view optimization, limiting its practicality in single-image scenarios. In this paper, we propose Materialist, a method combining a learning-based approach with physically based progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. Our approach enables a range of applications, including material editing, object insertion, and relighting, while also introducing an effective method for editing material transparency without requiring full scene geometry. Furthermore, Our envmap estimation method also achieves state-of-the-art performance, further enhancing the accuracy of image editing task. Experiments demonstrate strong performance across synthetic and real-world datasets, excelling even on challenging out-of-domain images.

      <title>DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>ClearSight: Human Vision-Inspired Solutions for Event-Based Motion Deblurring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion deblurring addresses the challenge of image blur caused by camera or scene movement. Event cameras provide motion information that is encoded in the asynchronous event streams. To efficiently leverage the temporal information of event streams, we employ Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for motion feature extraction and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for color information processing. Due to the non-uniform distribution and inherent redundancy of event data, existing cross-modal feature fusion methods exhibit certain limitations. Inspired by the visual attention mechanism in the human visual system, this study introduces a bioinspired dual-drive hybrid network (BDHNet). Specifically, the Neuron Configurator Module (NCM) is designed to dynamically adjusts neuron configurations based on cross-modal features, thereby focusing the spikes in blurry regions and adapting to varying blurry scenarios dynamically. Additionally, the Region of Blurry Attention Module (RBAM) is introduced to generate a blurry mask in an unsupervised manner, effectively extracting motion clues from the event features and guiding more accurate cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships in materials leveraging microstructure representation from foundational vision transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning of microstructure--property relationships from data is an emerging approach in computational materials science. Most existing machine learning efforts focus on the development of task-specific models for each microstructure--property relationship. We propose utilizing pre-trained foundational vision transformers for the extraction of task-agnostic microstructure features and subsequent light-weight machine learning of a microstructure-dependent property. We demonstrate our approach with pre-trained state-of-the-art vision transformers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM) in two case studies on machine-learning: (i) elastic modulus of two-phase microstructures based on simulations data; and (ii) Vicker's hardness of Ni-base and Co-base superalloys based on experimental data published in literature. Our results show the potential of foundational vision transformers for robust microstructure representation and efficient machine learning of microstructure--property relationships without the need for expensive task-specific training or fine-tuning of bespoke deep learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to improve the generalization capabilities. VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current image captioning systems lack the ability to link descriptive text to specific visual elements, making their outputs difficult to verify. While recent approaches offer some grounding capabilities, they cannot track object identities across multiple references or ground both actions and objects simultaneously. We propose a novel ID-based grounding system that enables consistent object reference tracking and action-object linking. We present GroundCap, a dataset containing 52,016 images from 77 movies, with 344 human-annotated and 52,016 automatically generated captions. Each caption is grounded on detected objects (132 classes) and actions (51 classes) using a tag system that maintains object identity while linking actions to the corresponding objects. Our approach features persistent object IDs for reference tracking, explicit action-object linking, and the segmentation of background elements through K-means clustering. We propose gMETEOR, a metric combining caption quality with grounding accuracy, and establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Pixtral-12B and Qwen2.5-VL 7B on GroundCap. Human evaluation demonstrates our approach's effectiveness in producing verifiable descriptions with coherent object references.</description>

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic lip movements and facial expressions for 3D head models from arbitrary audio clips. Although existing diffusion-based methods are capable of producing natural motions, their slow generation speed limits their application potential. In this paper, we introduce a novel autoregressive model that achieves real-time generation of highly synchronized lip movements and realistic head poses and eye blinks by learning a mapping from speech to a multi-scale motion codebook. Furthermore, our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles, enabling the creation of 3D talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during training. Extensive evaluations and user studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in lip synchronization accuracy and perceived quality.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of digitalization, various document images are being applied more extensively in production and daily life, and there is an increasingly urgent need for fast and accurate parsing of the content in document images. Therefore, this report presents PP-DocBee, a novel multimodal large language model designed for end-to-end document image understanding. First, we develop a data synthesis strategy tailored to document scenarios in which we build a diverse dataset to improve the model generalization. Then, we apply a few training techniques, including dynamic proportional sampling, data preprocessing, and OCR postprocessing strategies. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of PP-DocBee, achieving state-of-the-art results on English document understanding benchmarks and even outperforming existing open source and commercial models in Chinese document understanding.

      <title>Zero-TIG: Temporal Consistency-Aware Zero-Shot Illumination-Guided Low-light Video Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-light and underwater videos suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and high noise, necessitating enhancements in visual quality. However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.</description>

Abstract: We present AnyCalib, a method for calibrating the intrinsic parameters of a camera from a single in-the-wild image, that is agnostic to the camera model. Current methods are predominantly tailored to specific camera models and/or require extrinsic cues, such as the direction of gravity, to be visible in the image. In contrast, we argue that the perspective and distortion cues inherent in images are sufficient for model-agnostic camera calibration. To demonstrate this, we frame the calibration process as the regression of the rays corresponding to each pixel. We show, for the first time, that this intermediate representation allows for a closed-form recovery of the intrinsics for a wide range of camera models, including but not limited to: pinhole, Brown-Conrady and Kannala-Brandt. Our approach also applies to edited -- cropped and stretched -- images. Experimentally, we demonstrate that AnyCalib consistently outperforms alternative methods, including 3D foundation models, despite being trained on orders of magnitude less data.

      <title>Decouple to Reconstruct: High Quality UHD Restoration via Active Feature Disentanglement and Reversible Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-definition (UHD) image restoration often faces computational bottlenecks and information loss due to its extremely high resolution. Existing studies based on Variational Autoencoders (VAE) improve efficiency by transferring the image restoration process from pixel space to latent space. However, degraded components are inherently coupled with background elements in degraded images, both information loss during compression and information gain during compensation remain uncontrollable. These lead to restored images often exhibiting image detail loss and incomplete degradation removal. To address this issue, we propose a Controlled Differential Disentangled VAE, which utilizes Hierarchical Contrastive Disentanglement Learning and an Orthogonal Gated Projection Module to guide the VAE to actively discard easily recoverable background information while encoding more difficult-to-recover degraded information into the latent space. Additionally, we design a Complex Invertible Multiscale Fusion Network to handle background features, ensuring their consistency, and utilize a latent space restoration network to transform the degraded latent features, leading to more accurate restoration results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates the information loss problem in VAE models while ensuring computational efficiency, significantly improving the quality of UHD image restoration, and achieves state-of-the-art results in six UHD restoration tasks with only 1M parameters.</description>

      <title>3D Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation in Real Orchard Environments Across Different Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crop yield estimation is a relevant problem in agriculture, because an accurate yield estimate can support farmers' decisions on harvesting or precision intervention. Robots can help to automate this process. To do so, they need to be able to perceive the surrounding environment to identify target objects such as trees and plants. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the problem of hierarchical panoptic segmentation of apple orchards on 3D data from different sensors. Our approach is able to simultaneously provide semantic segmentation, instance segmentation of trunks and fruits, and instance segmentation of trees (a trunk with its fruits). This allows us to identify relevant information such as individual plants, fruits, and trunks, and capture the relationship among them, such as precisely estimate the number of fruits associated to each tree in an orchard. To efficiently evaluate our approach for hierarchical panoptic segmentation, we provide a dataset designed specifically for this task. Our dataset is recorded in Bonn, Germany, in a real apple orchard with a variety of sensors, spanning from a terrestrial laser scanner to a RGB-D camera mounted on different robots platforms. The experiments show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in 3D panoptic segmentation in the agricultural domain, while also providing full hierarchical panoptic segmentation. Our dataset is publicly available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/hops/. The open-source implementation of our approach is available at https://github.com/PRBonn/hapt3D.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology, a lack of data has become a major obstacle to enhancing perception model accuracy. Researchers are now exploring controllable data generation using world models to diversify datasets. However, previous work has been limited to studying image generation quality on specific public datasets. There is still relatively little research on how to build data generation engines for real-world application scenes to achieve large-scale data generation for challenging scenes. In this paper, a simulator-conditioned scene generation engine based on world model is proposed. By constructing a simulation system consistent with real-world scenes, simulation data and labels, which serve as the conditions for data generation in the world model, for any scenes can be collected. It is a novel data generation pipeline by combining the powerful scene simulation capabilities of the simulation engine with the robust data generation capabilities of the world model. In addition, a benchmark with proportionally constructed virtual and real data, is provided for exploring the capabilities of world models in real-world scenes. Quantitative results show that these generated images significantly improve downstream perception models performance. Finally, we explored the generative performance of the world model in urban autonomous driving scenarios. All the data and code will be available at https://github.com/Li-Zn-H/SimWorld.</description>

      <title>High Temporal Consistency through Semantic Similarity Propagation in Semi-Supervised Video Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Flight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation from RGB cameras is essential to the perception of autonomous flying vehicles. The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency.

      <title>DWIM: Towards Tool-aware Visual Reasoning via Discrepancy-aware Workflow Generation &amp; Instruct-Masking Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual reasoning (VR), which is crucial in many fields for enabling human-like visual understanding, remains highly challenging. Recently, compositional visual reasoning approaches, which leverage the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with integrated tools to solve problems, have shown promise as more effective strategies than end-to-end VR methods. However, these approaches face limitations, as frozen LLMs lack tool awareness in VR, leading to performance bottlenecks. While leveraging LLMs for reasoning is widely used in other domains, they are not directly applicable to VR due to limited training data, imperfect tools that introduce errors and reduce data collection efficiency in VR, and challenging in fine-tuning on noisy workflows. To address these challenges, we propose DWIM: i) Discrepancy-aware training Workflow generation, which assesses tool usage and extracts more viable workflows for training; and ii) Instruct-Masking fine-tuning, which guides the model to only clone effective actions, enabling the generation of more practical solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that DWIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various VR tasks, exhibiting strong generalization on multiple widely-used datasets.</description>

      <title>STI-Bench: Are MLLMs Ready for Precise Spatial-Temporal World Understanding?</title>

Abstract: The use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as an end-to-end solution for Embodied AI and Autonomous Driving has become a prevailing trend. While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</description>

      <title>AirCache: Activating Inter-modal Relevancy KV Cache Compression for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable reasoning capabilities and proficiency in generalization. However, processing a large number of visual tokens and generating long-context outputs impose substantial computational overhead, leading to excessive demands for key-value (KV) cache. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose AirCache, a novel KV cache compression method aimed at accelerating LVLMs inference. This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation. Inspired by these findings, we introduce an elite observation window for assessing the importance of visual components in the KV cache, focusing on stable inter-modal relevancy modeling with enhanced multi-perspective consistency. Additionally, we develop an adaptive layer-wise budget allocation strategy that capitalizes on the strength and skewness of token importance distribution, showcasing superior efficiency compared to uniform allocation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the full cache while retaining only 10% of visual KV cache, thereby reducing decoding latency by 29% to 66% across various batch size and prompt length of inputs. Notably, as cache retention rates decrease, our method exhibits increasing performance advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Image Models and Their Representation of People from Different Nationalities Engaging in Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how a popular Text-to-Image (T2I) model represents people from 208 different nationalities when prompted to generate images of individuals engaging in typical activities. Two scenarios were developed, and 644 images were generated based on input prompts that specified nationalities. The results show that in one scenario, 52.88% of images, and in the other, 27.4%, depict individuals wearing traditional attire. A statistically significant relationship was observed between this representation pattern and regions. This indicates that the issue disproportionately affects certain areas, particularly the Middle East &amp; North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. A notable association with income groups was also found. CLIP, ALIGN, and GPT-4.1 mini were used to measure alignment scores between generated images and 3320 prompts and captions, with findings indicating statistically significant higher scores for images featuring individuals in traditional attire in one scenario. The study also examined revised prompts, finding that the word "traditional" was added by the model to 88.46% of prompts for one scenario. These findings provide valuable insights into T2I models' representation of individuals across different countries, demonstrating how the examined model prioritizes traditional characteristics despite their impracticality for the given activities.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Training Dynamics of Image Restoration Transformers: A Revisit to Layer Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the internal training dynamics of image restoration~(IR) Transformers and uncovers a critical yet overlooked issue: conventional LayerNorm leads feature magnitude divergence, up to a million scale, and collapses channel-wise entropy. We analyze this phenomenon from the perspective of networks attempting to bypass constraints imposed by conventional LayerNorm due to conflicts against requirements in IR tasks. Accordingly, we address two misalignments between LayerNorm and IR tasks, and later show that addressing these mismatches leads to both stabilized training dynamics and improved IR performance. Specifically, conventional LayerNorm works in a per-token manner, disrupting spatial correlations between tokens, essential in IR tasks. Also, it employs an input-independent normalization that restricts the flexibility of feature scales, required to preserve input-specific statistics. Together, these mismatches significantly hinder IR Transformer's ability to accurately preserve low-level features throughout the network. To this end, we introduce Image Restoration Transformer Tailored Layer Normalization~(i-LN), a surprisingly simple drop-in replacement for conventional LayerNorm. We propose to normalize features in a holistic manner across the entire spatio-channel dimension, preserving spatial relationships among individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling strategy that maintains the feature range flexibility required by individual inputs. Together, these modifications effectively contribute to preserving low-level feature statistics of inputs throughout IR Transformers. Experimental results verify that this combined strategy enhances both the stability and performance of IR Transformers across various IR tasks.</description>

      <title>BRepFormer: Transformer-Based B-rep Geometric Feature Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognizing geometric features on B-rep models is a cornerstone technique for multimedia content-based retrieval and has been widely applied in intelligent manufacturing. However, previous research often merely focused on Machining Feature Recognition (MFR), falling short in effectively capturing the intricate topological and geometric characteristics of complex geometry features. In this paper, we propose BRepFormer, a novel transformer-based model to recognize both machining feature and complex CAD models' features. BRepFormer encodes and fuses the geometric and topological features of the models. Afterwards, BRepFormer utilizes a transformer architecture for feature propagation and a recognition head to identify geometry features. During each iteration of the transformer, we incorporate a bias that combines edge features and topology features to reinforce geometric constraints on each face. In addition, we also proposed a dataset named Complex B-rep Feature Dataset (CBF), comprising 20,000 B-rep models. By covering more complex B-rep models, it is better aligned with industrial applications. The experimental results demonstrate that BRepFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MFInstSeg, MFTRCAD, and our CBF datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spiking Point Mamba for Point Cloud Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D spatio-temporal features. However, existing 3D SNNs have struggled with long-range dependencies until the recent emergence of Mamba, which offers superior computational efficiency and sequence modeling capability. In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs. Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art SNN models, SPM improves OA by +6.2%, +6.1%, and +7.4% on three variants of ScanObjectNN, and boosts instance mIOU by +1.9% on ShapeNetPart. Meanwhile, its energy consumption is at least 3.5x lower than that of its ANN counterpart. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Context Aware Grounded Teacher for Source Free Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the Source Free Object Detection (SFOD) problem, when source data is unavailable during adaptation, and the model must adapt to the unlabeled target domain. In medical imaging, several approaches have leveraged a semi-supervised student-teacher architecture to bridge domain discrepancy. Context imbalance in labeled training data and significant domain shifts between domains can lead to biased teacher models that produce inaccurate pseudolabels, degrading the student model's performance and causing a mode collapse. Class imbalance, particularly when one class significantly outnumbers another, leads to contextual bias. To tackle the problem of context bias and the significant performance drop of the student model in the SFOD setting, we introduce Grounded Teacher (GT) as a standard framework. In this study, we model contextual relationships using a dedicated relational context module and leverage it to mitigate inherent biases in the model. This approach enables us to apply augmentations to closely related classes, across and within domains, enhancing the performance of underrepresented classes while keeping the effect on dominant classes minimal. We further improve the quality of predictions by implementing an expert foundational branch to supervise the student model. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating context bias under the SFOD setting through experiments on three medical datasets supported by comprehensive ablation studies. All relevant resources, including preprocessed data, trained model weights, and code, are publicly available at this https://github.com/Tajamul21/Grounded_Teacher.</description>

      <title>JointDiT: Enhancing RGB-Depth Joint Modeling with Diffusion Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e., adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional generation.

      <title>StateSpaceDiffuser: Bringing Long Context to Diffusion World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World models have recently become promising tools for predicting realistic visuals based on actions in complex environments. However, their reliance on only a few recent observations leads them to lose track of the long-term context. Consequently, in just a few steps the generated scenes drift from what was previously observed, undermining the temporal coherence of the sequence. This limitation of the state-of-the-art world models, most of which rely on diffusion, comes from their lack of a lasting environment state. To address this problem, we introduce StateSpaceDiffuser, where a diffusion model is enabled to perform long-context tasks by integrating features from a state-space model, representing the entire interaction history. This design restores long-term memory while preserving the high-fidelity synthesis of diffusion models. To rigorously measure temporal consistency, we develop an evaluation protocol that probes a model's ability to reinstantiate seen content in extended rollouts. Comprehensive experiments show that StateSpaceDiffuser significantly outperforms a strong diffusion-only baseline, maintaining a coherent visual context for an order of magnitude more steps. It delivers consistent views in both a 2D maze navigation and a complex 3D environment. These results establish that bringing state-space representations into diffusion models is highly effective in demonstrating both visual details and long-term memory.</description>

      <title>SA-Person: Text-Based Person Retrieval with Scene-aware Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from a gallery of images based on a natural language description. It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>TaxaDiffusion: Progressively Trained Diffusion Model for Fine-Grained Species Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships, TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors, facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image generation.

      <title>RobustSplat: Decoupling Densification and Dynamics for Transient-Free 3DGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its real-time, photo-realistic rendering in novel-view synthesis and 3D modeling. However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling scenes affected by transient objects, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances. To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Do It Yourself: Learning Semantic Correspondence from Pseudo-Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose to improve semantic correspondence estimation via 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset specific annotations compared to prior work, we set a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k by over 4% absolute gain and by over 7% against methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.</description>

      <title>EgoM2P: Egocentric Multimodal Multitask Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding multimodal signals in egocentric vision, such as RGB video, depth, camera poses, and gaze, is essential for applications in augmented reality, robotics, and human-computer interaction, enabling systems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and surrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal and multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and settings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or head-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard supervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera motion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video pose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal foundation models.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal tokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from temporally-aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for egocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across diverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction, egocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric video, and also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric video synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist models while being an order of magnitude faster. We will fully open-source EgoM2P to support the community and advance egocentric vision research. Project page: https://egom2p.github.io/.</description>

      <title>OneIG-Bench: Omni-dimensional Nuanced Evaluation for Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.</description>

      <title>Aligned Novel View Image and Geometry Synthesis via Cross-modal Attention Instillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

      <title>Structure-Preserving Patch Decoding for Efficient Neural Video Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) are the subject of extensive research, particularly in their application to modeling complex signals by mapping spatial and temporal coordinates to corresponding values. When handling videos, mapping compact inputs to entire frames or spatially partitioned patch images is an effective approach. This strategy better preserves spatial relationships, reduces computational overhead, and improves reconstruction quality compared to coordinate-based mapping. However, predicting entire frames often limits the reconstruction of high-frequency visual details. Additionally, conventional patch-based approaches based on uniform spatial partitioning tend to introduce boundary discontinuities that degrade spatial coherence. We propose a neural video representation method based on Structure-Preserving Patches (SPPs) to address such limitations. Our method separates each video frame into patch images of spatially aligned frames through a deterministic pixel-based splitting similar to PixelUnshuffle. This operation preserves the global spatial structure while allowing patch-level decoding. We train the decoder to reconstruct these structured patches, enabling a global-to-local decoding strategy that captures the global layout first and refines local details. This effectively reduces boundary artifacts and mitigates distortions from naive upsampling. Experiments on standard video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves higher reconstruction quality and better compression performance than existing INR-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Fake it till You Make it: Reward Modeling as Discriminative Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective reward model plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning for post-training enhancement of visual generative models. However, current approaches of reward modeling suffer from implementation complexity due to their reliance on extensive human-annotated preference data or meticulously engineered quality dimensions that are often incomplete and engineering-intensive. Inspired by adversarial training in generative adversarial networks (GANs), this paper proposes GAN-RM, an efficient reward modeling framework that eliminates manual preference annotation and explicit quality dimension engineering. Our method trains the reward model through discrimination between a small set of representative, unpaired target samples(denoted as Preference Proxy Data) and model-generated ordinary outputs, requiring only a few hundred target samples. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our GAN-RM's effectiveness across multiple key applications including test-time scaling implemented as Best-of-N sample filtering, post-training approaches like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Visualignment/GAN-RM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) being an effective privacy-preserving alternative to RGB cameras to perceive human activities, it remains largely underexplored in the context of multi-modal contrastive pre-training for human activity understanding (e.g., human activity recognition (HAR), retrieval, or person re-identification (RE-ID)). To close this gap, our work explores learning the correspondence between LiDAR point clouds, human skeleton poses, IMU data, and text in a joint embedding space. More specifically, we present DeSPITE, a Deep Skeleton-Pointcloud-IMU-Text Embedding model, which effectively learns a joint embedding space across these four modalities. At the heart of our empirical exploration, we have combined the existing LIPD and Babel datasets, which enabled us to synchronize data of all four modalities, allowing us to explore the learning of a new joint embedding space. Our experiments demonstrate novel human activity understanding tasks for point cloud sequences enabled through DeSPITE, including Skeleton&lt;-&gt;Pointcloud&lt;-&gt;IMU matching, retrieval, and temporal moment retrieval. Furthermore, we show that DeSPITE is an effective pre-training strategy for point cloud HAR through experiments in MSR-Action3D and HMPEAR.</description>

      <title>HyperPath: Knowledge-Guided Hyperbolic Semantic Hierarchy Modeling for WSI Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pathology is essential for cancer diagnosis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) widely used for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional image data often require dimensionality reduction before further analysis. This paper provides a purely analytical comparison of two linear techniques-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). After the derivation of each algorithm from first principles, we assess their interpretability, numerical stability, and suitability for differing matrix shapes. We synthesize rule-of-thumb guidelines for choosing one out of the two algorithms without empirical benchmarking, building on classical and recent numerical literature. Limitations and directions for future experimental work are outlined at the end.</description>

      <title>MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</description>

      <title>Referring Expression Instance Retrieval and A Strong End-to-End Baseline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using natural language to query visual information is a fundamental need in real-world applications. Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves a target image from a gallery based on an image-level description, while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes a target object within a given image using an instance-level description. However, real-world applications often present more complex demands. Users typically query an instance-level description across a large gallery and expect to receive both relevant image and the corresponding instance location. In such scenarios, TIR struggles with fine-grained descriptions and object-level localization, while REC is limited in its ability to efficiently search large galleries and lacks an effective ranking mechanism. In this paper, we introduce a new task called \textbf{Referring Expression Instance Retrieval (REIR)}, which supports both instance-level retrieval and localization based on fine-grained referring expressions. First, we propose a large-scale benchmark for REIR, named REIRCOCO, constructed by prompting advanced vision-language models to generate high-quality referring expressions for instances in the MSCOCO and RefCOCO datasets. Second, we present a baseline method, Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment with Relation Experts (CLARE), which employs a dual-stream architecture to address REIR in an end-to-end manner. Given a referring expression, the textual branch encodes it into a query embedding. The visual branch detects candidate objects and extracts their instance-level visual features. The most similar candidate to the query is selected for bounding box prediction. CLARE is first trained on object detection and REC datasets to establish initial grounding capabilities, then optimized via Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment (CLIA) for improved retrieval across images. We will release our code and benchmark publicly.</description>

      <title>2D Triangle Splatting for Direct Differentiable Mesh Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets. This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning), achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods. Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

      <title>Generate the Forest before the Trees -- A Hierarchical Diffusion model for Climate Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Downscaling is essential for generating the high-resolution climate data needed for local planning, but traditional methods remain computationally demanding. Recent years have seen impressive results from AI downscaling models, particularly diffusion models, which have attracted attention due to their ability to generate ensembles and overcome the smoothing problem common in other AI methods. However, these models typically remain computationally intensive. We introduce a Hierarchical Diffusion Downscaling (HDD) model, which introduces an easily-extensible hierarchical sampling process to the diffusion framework. A coarse-to-fine hierarchy is imposed via a simple downsampling scheme. HDD achieves competitive accuracy on ERA5 reanalysis datasets and CMIP6 models, significantly reducing computational load by running on up to half as many pixels with competitive results. Additionally, a single model trained at 0.25{\deg} resolution transfers seamlessly across multiple CMIP6 models with much coarser resolution. HDD thus offers a lightweight alternative for probabilistic climate downscaling, facilitating affordable large-ensemble high-resolution climate projections. See a full code implementation at: https://github.com/HDD-Hierarchical-Diffusion-Downscaling/HDD-Hierarchical-Diffusion-Downscaling.</description>

      <title>Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable and Generalizable Earth Observation Data Mining via Foundation Model Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models are rapidly transforming Earth Observation data mining by enabling generalizable and scalable solutions for key tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation. While most efforts in the geospatial domain have focused on developing large models trained from scratch using massive Earth Observation datasets, an alternative strategy that remains underexplored is the reuse and combination of existing pretrained models. In this study, we investigate whether foundation models pretrained on remote sensing and general vision datasets can be effectively combined to improve performance across a diverse set of key Earth Observation tasks. Using the GEO-Bench benchmark, we evaluate several prominent models, including Prithvi, Hiera, and DOFA, on eleven datasets covering a range of spatial resolutions, sensor modalities, and task types. The results show that feature-level ensembling of smaller pretrained models can match or exceed the performance of much larger models, while requiring less training time and computational resources. Moreover, the study highlights the potential of applying knowledge distillation to transfer the strengths of ensembles into more compact models, offering a practical path for deploying foundation models in real-world Earth Observation applications.</description>

      <title>PuriDefense: Randomized Local Implicit Adversarial Purification for Defending Black-box Query-based Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-box query-based attacks constitute significant threats to Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) systems since they can generate adversarial examples without accessing the target model's architecture and parameters. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, gradient masking, and input transformations, either impose substantial computational costs or compromise the test accuracy of non-adversarial inputs. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient defense mechanism, PuriDefense, that employs random patch-wise purifications with an ensemble of lightweight purification models at a low level of inference cost. These models leverage the local implicit function and rebuild the natural image manifold. Our theoretical analysis suggests that this approach slows down the convergence of query-based attacks by incorporating randomness into purifications. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our proposed purifier-based defense mechanism, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against query-based attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dynamic CT Image Reconstruction with Neural Fields and Optical Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate image reconstruction for dynamic Computed Tomography. The motion of the target with respect to the measurement acquisition rate leads to highly resolved in time but highly undersampled in space measurements. Such problems pose a major challenge: not accounting for the dynamics of the process leads to a poor reconstruction with non-realistic motion. Variational approaches that penalize time evolution have been proposed to relate subsequent frames and improve image quality based on classical grid-based discretizations. Neural fields have emerged as a novel way to parameterize the quantity of interest using a neural network with a low-dimensional input, benefiting from being lightweight, continuous, and biased towards smooth representations. The latter property has been exploited when solving dynamic inverse problems with neural fields by minimizing a data-fidelity term only. We investigate and show the benefits of introducing explicit motion regularizers for dynamic inverse problems based on partial differential equations, namely, the optical flow equation, for the optimization of neural fields. We compare it against its unregularized counterpart and show the improvements in the reconstruction. We also compare neural fields against a grid-based solver and show that the former outperforms the latter in terms of PSNR in this task.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Sketch: Enabling Global Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern vision models have achieved remarkable success in benchmarks where local features provide critical information about the target. There is now a growing interest in tackling tasks requiring more global reasoning, where local features do not provide significant information. Minsky and Papert put forward such tasks in 1969 with their connectivity study, exposing the limitations of the perceptron model. In this paper, we introduce an expanded set of global visual datasets involving graphs, strings, mazes, and image grids. We show that large vision models still struggle to learn these tasks efficiently. Similarly, state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs perform poorly on these datasets. We explain this learning inefficiency by means of the 'globality degree' measure. To mitigate this, we propose a method called chain-of-sketch (CoS). Similar to the chain-of-thought and scratchpad techniques used in language models, CoS breaks the original task into intermediate visual steps to help learn a complex task. In addition, we show that not all CoS strategies perform equally well. Our key insight is to impose a Markovian structure on the CoS frames. This leads to the introduction of 'inductive CoS' which achieves better out-of-distribution generalization and performs well even with smaller models compared to non-inductive variants.</description>

      <title>GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</description>

      <title>Moderating the Generalization of Score-based Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization abilities, e.g. generating unseen, but natural data. However, the greater the generalization power, the more likely the unintended generalization, and the more dangerous the abuse. Research on moderated generalization in SGMs remains limited. To fill this gap, we first examine the current 'gold standard' in Machine Unlearning (MU), i.e., re-training the model after removing the undesirable training data, and find it does not work in SGMs. Further analysis of score functions reveals that the MU 'gold standard' does not alter the original score function, which explains its ineffectiveness. Based on this insight, we propose the first Moderated Score-based Generative Model (MSGM), which introduces a novel score adjustment strategy that redirects the score function away from undesirable data during the continuous-time stochastic differential equation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MSGM significantly reduces the likelihood of generating undesirable content while preserving high visual quality for normal image generation. Albeit designed for SGMs, MSGM is a general and flexible MU framework that is compatible with diverse diffusion architectures (SGM and DDPM) and training strategies (re-training and fine-tuning), and enables zero-shot transfer of the pre-trained models to downstream tasks, e.g. image inpainting and reconstruction. The code will be shared upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Discovering Global False Negatives On the Fly for Self-supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In self-supervised contrastive learning, negative pairs are typically constructed using an anchor image and a sample drawn from the entire dataset, excluding the anchor. However, this approach can result in the creation of negative pairs with similar semantics, referred to as "false negatives", leading to their embeddings being falsely pushed apart. To address this issue, we introduce GloFND, an optimization-based approach that automatically learns on the fly the threshold for each anchor data to identify its false negatives during training. In contrast to previous methods for false negative discovery, our approach globally detects false negatives across the entire dataset rather than locally within the mini-batch. Moreover, its per-iteration computation cost remains independent of the dataset size. Experimental results on image and image-text data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/vibalcam/GloFND.</description>

      <title>CREStE: Scalable Mapless Navigation with Internet Scale Priors and Counterfactual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CREStE, a scalable learning-based mapless navigation framework to address the open-world generalization and robustness challenges of outdoor urban navigation. Key to achieving this is learning perceptual representations that generalize to open-set factors (e.g. novel semantic classes, terrains, dynamic entities) and inferring expert-aligned navigation costs from limited demonstrations. CREStE addresses both these issues, introducing 1) a visual foundation model (VFM) distillation objective for learning open-set structured bird's-eye-view perceptual representations, and 2) counterfactual inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a novel active learning formulation that uses counterfactual trajectory demonstrations to reason about the most important cues when inferring navigation costs. We evaluate CREStE on the task of kilometer-scale mapless navigation in a variety of city, offroad, and residential environments and find that it outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches with 70% fewer human interventions, including a 2-kilometer mission in an unseen environment with just 1 intervention; showcasing its robustness and effectiveness for long-horizon mapless navigation.

      <title>HUG: Hierarchical Urban Gaussian Splatting with Block-Based Reconstruction for Large-Scale Aerial Scenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3DGS is an emerging and increasingly popular technology in the field of novel view synthesis. Its highly realistic rendering quality and real-time rendering capabilities make it promising for various applications. However, when applied to large-scale aerial urban scenes, 3DGS methods suffer from issues such as excessive memory consumption, slow training times, prolonged partitioning processes, and significant degradation in rendering quality due to the increased data volume. To tackle these challenges, we introduce \textbf{HUG}, a novel approach that enhances data partitioning and reconstruction quality by leveraging a hierarchical neural Gaussian representation. We first propose a visibility-based data partitioning method that is simple yet highly efficient, significantly outperforming existing methods in speed. Then, we introduce a novel hierarchical weighted training approach, combined with other optimization strategies, to substantially improve reconstruction quality. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on one synthetic dataset and four real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Always Skip Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.</description>

      <title>Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven to be highly efficient and adaptable in shaping representation spaces across diverse modalities by pulling similar samples together and pushing dissimilar ones apart. However, two key limitations persist: (1) Without explicit regulation of the embedding distribution, semantically related instances can inadvertently be pushed apart unless complementary signals guide pair selection, and (2) excessive reliance on large in-batch negatives and tailored augmentations hinders generalization. To address these limitations, we propose Variational Supervised Contrastive Learning (VarCon), which reformulates supervised contrastive learning as variational inference over latent class variables and maximizes a posterior-weighted evidence lower bound (ELBO) that replaces exhaustive pair-wise comparisons for efficient class-aware matching and grants fine-grained control over intra-class dispersion in the embedding space. Trained exclusively on image data, our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K show that VarCon (1) achieves state-of-the-art performance for contrastive learning frameworks, reaching 79.36% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and 78.29% on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-50 encoder while converging in just 200 epochs; (2) yields substantially clearer decision boundaries and semantic organization in the embedding space, as evidenced by KNN classification, hierarchical clustering results, and transfer-learning assessments; and (3) demonstrates superior performance in few-shot learning than supervised baseline and superior robustness across various augmentation strategies.</description>

      <title>Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

      <title>BlenderFusion: 3D-Grounded Visual Editing and Generative Compositing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original (source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering, facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing tasks.</description>

      <title>DSA-NRP: No-Reflow Prediction from Angiographic Perfusion Dynamics in Stroke EVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes. Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure, delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI. No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax &gt; 6 s) on post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC: 0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331 $\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.</description>

      <title>TCDiff++: An End-to-end Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion Model for Harmonious Music-Driven Group Choreography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.</description>

      <title>SoK: Can Synthetic Images Replace Real Data? A Survey of Utility and Privacy of Synthetic Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in generative models have transformed the field of synthetic image generation for privacy-preserving data synthesis (PPDS). However, the field lacks a comprehensive survey and comparison of synthetic image generation methods across diverse settings. In particular, when we generate synthetic images for the purpose of training a classifier, there is a pipeline of generation-sampling-classification which takes private training as input and outputs the final classifier of interest. In this survey, we systematically categorize existing image synthesis methods, privacy attacks, and mitigations along this generation-sampling-classification pipeline. To empirically compare diverse synthesis approaches, we provide a benchmark with representative generative methods and use model-agnostic membership inference attacks (MIAs) as a measure of privacy risk. Through this study, we seek to answer critical questions in PPDS: Can synthetic data effectively replace real data? Which release strategy balances utility and privacy? Do mitigations improve the utility-privacy tradeoff? Which generative models perform best across different scenarios? With a systematic evaluation of diverse methods, our study provides actionable insights into the utility-privacy tradeoffs of synthetic data generation methods and guides the decision on optimal data releasing strategies for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Consensus-Driven Uncertainty for Robotic Grasping based on RGB Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep object pose estimators are notoriously overconfident. A grasping agent that both estimates the 6-DoF pose of a target object and predicts the uncertainty of its own estimate could avoid task failure by choosing not to act under high uncertainty. Even though object pose estimation improves and uncertainty quantification research continues to make strides, few studies have connected them to the downstream task of robotic grasping. We propose a method for training lightweight, deep networks to predict whether a grasp guided by an image-based pose estimate will succeed before that grasp is attempted. We generate training data for our networks via object pose estimation on real images and simulated grasping. We also find that, despite high object variability in grasping trials, networks benefit from training on all objects jointly, suggesting that a diverse variety of objects can nevertheless contribute to the same goal.</description>
