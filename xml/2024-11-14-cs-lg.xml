      <title>Ozone level forecasting in Mexico City with temporal features and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropospheric ozone is an atmospheric pollutant that negatively impacts human health and the environment. Precise estimation of ozone levels is essential for preventive measures and mitigating its effects. This work compares the accuracy of multiple regression models in forecasting ozone levels in Mexico City, first without adding temporal features and interactions, and then with these features included. Our findings show that incorporating temporal features and interactions improves the accuracy of the models.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Forecasting of the Dynamics of a Floating Wind Turbine Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a data-driven equation-free modeling of the dynamics of a hexafloat floating offshore wind turbine based on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The DMD is here used to provide a modal analysis and extract knowledge from the dynamic system. A forecasting algorithm for the motions, accelerations, and forces acting on the floating system, as well as the height of the incoming waves, the wind speed, and the power extracted by the wind turbine, is developed by using a methodological extension called Hankel-DMD, that includes time-delayed copies of the states in an augmented state vector. All the analyses are performed on experimental data collected from an operating prototype. The quality of the forecasts obtained varying two main hyperparameters of the algorithm, namely the number of delayed copies and the length of the observation time, is assessed using three different error metrics, each analyzing complementary aspects of the prediction. A statistical analysis exposed the existence of optimal values for the algorithm hyperparameters. Results show the approach's capability for short-term future estimates of the system's state, which can be used for real-time prediction and control. Furthermore, a novel Stochastic Hankel-DMD formulation is introduced by considering hyperparameters as stochastic variables. The stochastic version of the method not only enriches the prediction with its related uncertainty but is also found to improve the normalized root mean square error up to 10% on a statistical basis compared to the deterministic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Learning From Graph-Structured Data: Addressing Design Issues and Exploring Practical Applications in Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs serve as fundamental descriptors for systems composed of interacting elements, capturing a wide array of data types, from molecular interactions to social networks and knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present an exhaustive review of the latest advancements in graph representation learning and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs, tailored to handle graph-structured data, excel in deriving insights and predictions from intricate relational information, making them invaluable for tasks involving such data. Graph representation learning, a pivotal approach in analyzing graph-structured data, facilitates numerous downstream tasks and applications across machine learning, data mining, biomedicine, and healthcare.
  Our work delves into the capabilities of GNNs, examining their foundational designs and their application in addressing real-world challenges. We introduce a GNN equipped with an advanced high-order pooling function, adept at capturing complex node interactions within graph-structured data. This pooling function significantly enhances the GNN's efficacy in both node- and graph-level tasks. Additionally, we propose a molecular graph generative model with a GNN as its core framework. This GNN backbone is proficient in learning invariant and equivariant molecular characteristics. Employing these features, the molecular graph generative model is capable of simultaneously learning and generating molecular graphs with atom-bond structures and precise atom positions. Our models undergo thorough experimental evaluations and comparisons with established methods, showcasing their superior performance in addressing diverse real-world challenges with various datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Upstream Preemptive Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing myopic pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. Effective signal control, however, inherently requires a broader spatial scope, as traffic conditions further upstream can significantly impact traffic at the current location. This paper introduces a novel concept based on the Markov chain theory, namely multi-hop upstream pressure, that generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the present queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in OKTA Logs using Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Okta logs are used today to detect cybersecurity events using various rule-based models with restricted look back periods. These functions have limitations, such as a limited retrospective analysis, a predefined rule set, and susceptibility to generating false positives. To address this, we adopt unsupervised techniques, specifically employing autoencoders. To properly use an autoencoder, we need to transform and simplify the complexity of the log data we receive from our users. This transformed and filtered data is then fed into the autoencoder, and the output is evaluated.</description>

      <title>SynRL: Aligning Synthetic Clinical Trial Data with Human-preferred Clinical Endpoints Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, hundreds of clinical trials are conducted to evaluate new medical interventions, but sharing patient records from these trials with other institutions can be challenging due to privacy concerns and federal regulations. To help mitigate privacy concerns, researchers have proposed methods for generating synthetic patient data. However, existing approaches for generating synthetic clinical trial data disregard the usage requirements of these data, including maintaining specific properties of clinical outcomes, and only use post hoc assessments that are not coupled with the data generation process. In this paper, we propose SynRL which leverages reinforcement learning to improve the performance of patient data generators by customizing the generated data to meet the user-specified requirements for synthetic data outcomes and endpoints. Our method includes a data value critic function to evaluate the quality of the generated data and uses reinforcement learning to align the data generator with the users' needs based on the critic's feedback. We performed experiments on four clinical trial datasets and demonstrated the advantages of SynRL in improving the quality of the generated synthetic data while keeping the privacy risks low. We also show that SynRL can be utilized as a general framework that can customize data generation of multiple types of synthetic data generators. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SynRL-DB0F/.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Fusion Balancing Through Game-Theoretic Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by uncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail to fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been attributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training resources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods struggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as ensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in multimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new modalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the Multimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by mutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects of competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1) Introducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each modality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final outcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and upper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique and shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space permutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving computational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training strategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond the ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to significant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Warmstarting for Scaling Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling model sizes to scale performance has worked remarkably well for the current large language models paradigm. The research and empirical findings of various scaling studies led to novel scaling results and laws that guides subsequent research. High training costs for contemporary scales of data and models result in a lack of thorough understanding of how to tune and arrive at such training setups. One direction to ameliorate the cost of pretraining large models is to warmstart the large-scale training from smaller models that are cheaper to tune. In this work, we attempt to understand if the behavior of optimal hyperparameters can be retained under warmstarting for scaling. We explore simple operations that allow the application of theoretically motivated methods of zero-shot transfer of optimal hyperparameters using {\mu}Transfer. We investigate the aspects that contribute to the speedup in convergence and the preservation of stable training dynamics under warmstarting with {\mu}Transfer. We find that shrinking smaller model weights, zero-padding, and perturbing the resulting larger model with scaled initialization from {\mu}P enables effective warmstarting of $\mut{}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Variational Autoencoders for Medical Image Generation: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational autoencoder (VAE) is one of the most common techniques in the field of medical image generation, where this architecture has shown advanced researchers in recent years and has developed into various architectures. VAE has advantages including improving datasets by adding samples in smaller datasets and in datasets with imbalanced classes, and this is how data augmentation works. This paper provides a comprehensive review of studies on VAE in medical imaging, with a special focus on their ability to create synthetic images close to real data so that they can be used for data augmentation. This study reviews important architectures and methods used to develop VAEs for medical images and provides a comparison with other generative models such as GANs on issues such as image quality, and low diversity of generated samples. We discuss recent developments and applications in several medical fields highlighting the ability of VAEs to improve segmentation and classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Identifying Differential Patient Care Through Inverse Intent Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined by end-organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. Although the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has launched and has been releasing sepsis treatment guidelines to unify and normalize the care for sepsis patients, it has been reported in numerous studies that disparities in care exist across the trajectory of patient stay in the emergency department and intensive care unit. Here, we apply a number of reinforcement learning techniques including behavioral cloning, imitation learning, and inverse reinforcement learning, to learn the optimal policy in the management of septic patient subgroups using expert demonstrations. Then we estimate the counterfactual optimal policies by applying the model to another subset of unseen medical populations and identify the difference in cure by comparing it to the real policy. Our data comes from the sepsis cohort of MIMIC-IV and the clinical data warehouses of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. The ultimate objective of this work is to use the optimal learned policy function to estimate the counterfactual treatment policy and identify deviations across sub-populations of interest. We hope this approach would help us identify any disparities in care and also changes in cure in response to the publication of national sepsis treatment guidelines.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Client Pruning for Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL methods often assume clean annotated datasets, impractical for resource-constrained edge devices. In reality, noisy labels are prevalent, posing significant challenges to FL performance. Prior approaches attempt label correction and robust training techniques but exhibit limited efficacy, particularly under high noise levels. This paper introduces ClipFL (Federated Learning Client Pruning), a novel framework addressing noisy labels from a fresh perspective. ClipFL identifies and excludes noisy clients based on their performance on a clean validation dataset, tracked using a Noise Candidacy Score (NCS). The framework comprises three phases: pre-client pruning to identify potential noisy clients and calculate their NCS, client pruning to exclude a percentage of clients with the highest NCS, and post-client pruning for fine-tuning the global model with standard FL on clean clients. Empirical evaluation demonstrates ClipFL's efficacy across diverse datasets and noise levels, achieving accurate noisy client identification, superior performance, faster convergence, and reduced communication costs compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.

      <title>ODEStream: A Buffer-Free Online Learning Framework with ODE-based Adaptor for Streaming Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the challenges of irregularity and concept drift in streaming time series is crucial in real-world predictive modelling. Previous studies in time series continual learning often propose models that require buffering of long sequences, potentially restricting the responsiveness of the inference system. Moreover, these models are typically designed for regularly sampled data, an unrealistic assumption in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces ODEStream, a novel buffer-free continual learning framework that incorporates a temporal isolation layer that integrates temporal dependencies within the data. Simultaneously, it leverages the capability of neural ordinary differential equations to process irregular sequences and generate a continuous data representation, enabling seamless adaptation to changing dynamics in a data streaming scenario. Our approach focuses on learning how the dynamics and distribution of historical data change with time, facilitating the direct processing of streaming sequences. Evaluations on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that ODEStream outperforms the state-of-the-art online learning and streaming analysis baselines, providing accurate predictions over extended periods while minimising performance degradation over time by learning how the sequence dynamics change.</description>

      <title>Comparing Targeting Strategies for Maximizing Social Welfare with Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used to select which individuals receive limited-resource interventions in domains such as human services, education, development, and more. However, it is often not apparent what the right quantity is for models to predict. In particular, policymakers rarely have access to data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would enable accurate estimates of treatment effects -- which individuals would benefit more from the intervention. Observational data is more likely to be available, creating a substantial risk of bias in treatment effect estimates. Practitioners instead commonly use a technique termed "risk-based targeting" where the model is just used to predict each individual's status quo outcome (an easier, non-causal task). Those with higher predicted risk are offered treatment. There is currently almost no empirical evidence to inform which choices lead to the most effect machine learning-informed targeting strategies in social domains. In this work, we use data from 5 real-world RCTs in a variety of domains to empirically assess such choices. We find that risk-based targeting is almost always inferior to targeting based on even biased estimates of treatment effects. Moreover, these results hold even when the policymaker has strong normative preferences for assisting higher-risk individuals. Our results imply that, despite the widespread use of risk prediction models in applied settings, practitioners may be better off incorporating even weak evidence about heterogeneous causal effects to inform targeting.</description>

      <title>Predicting BWR Criticality with Data-Driven Machine Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges in operating nuclear power plants is to decide the amount of fuel needed in a cycle. Large-scale nuclear power plants are designed to operate at base load, meaning that they are expected to always operate at full power. Economically, a nuclear power plant should burn enough fuel to maintain criticality until the end of a cycle (EOC). If the reactor goes subcritical before the end of a cycle, it may result in early coastdown as the fuel in the core is already depleted. On contrary, if the reactor still has significant excess reactivity by the end of a cycle, the remaining fuels will remain unused. In both cases, the plant may lose a significant amount of money. This work proposes an innovative method based on a data-driven deep learning model to estimate the excess criticality of a boiling water reactor.</description>

      <title>Fast unsupervised ground metric learning with tree-Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of unsupervised methods such as clustering depends on the choice of distance metric between features, or ground metric. Commonly, ground metrics are decided with heuristics or learned via supervised algorithms. However, since many datasets are unlabelled, unsupervised ground metric learning approaches have been introduced. One recent, promising option uses Wasserstein singular vectors (WSV), which emerge when computing optimal transport distances between features and samples simultaneously. While WSV is effective, it has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^5)$, which is prohibitively expensive in some applications. In this work, we propose to augment the WSV method by embedding samples and features on trees, on which we compute the tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the algorithm converges to a better approximation of the full WSV approach than the best known alternatives, and does so with $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ complexity. In addition, we prove that the initial tree structure can be chosen flexibly, since tree geometry does not constrain the richness of the approximation up to the number of edge weights. This proof suggests a fast, recursive algorithm for computing the tree parameter basis set, which we find crucial to realising the efficiency gains at scale. Finally, we employ the tree-WSV algorithm to several single-cell RNA sequencing genomics datasets, demonstrating its scalability and utility for unsupervised cell-type clustering problems. These results poise unsupervised ground metric learning with TWD as a low-rank approximation of WSV with the potential for widespread low-compute application.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate quiver mutation -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of mutation equivalence is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? Currently, this question has only been resolved in specific cases. In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to discover mutation equivalence criteria for the previously unknown case of quivers of type $\tilde{D}_n$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D_n$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and general rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Link Prediction with Fuzzy Graph Attention Networks and Dynamic Negative Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is crucial for understanding complex networks but traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often rely on random negative sampling, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper introduces Fuzzy Graph Attention Networks (FGAT), a novel approach integrating fuzzy rough sets for dynamic negative sampling and enhanced node feature aggregation. Fuzzy Negative Sampling (FNS) systematically selects high-quality negative edges based on fuzzy similarities, improving training efficiency. FGAT layer incorporates fuzzy rough set principles, enabling robust and discriminative node representations. Experiments on two research collaboration networks demonstrate FGAT's superior link prediction accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by leveraging the power of fuzzy rough sets for effective negative sampling and node feature learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the core pillars of efficient deep learning methods is architectural improvements such as the residual/skip connection, which has led to significantly better model convergence and quality. Since then the residual connection has become ubiquitous in not just convolutional neural networks but also transformer-based architectures, the backbone of LLMs.
  In this paper we introduce \emph{Learned Augmented Residual Layer} (LAuReL) -- a novel generalization of the canonical residual connection -- with the goal to be an in-situ replacement of the latter while outperforming on both model quality and footprint metrics. Our experiments show that using \laurel can help boost performance for both vision and language models. For example, on the ResNet-50, ImageNet 1K task, it achieves $60\%$ of the gains from adding an extra layer, while only adding $0.003\%$ more parameters, and matches it while adding $2.6\times$ fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>FM-TS: Flow Matching for Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series generation has emerged as an essential tool for analyzing temporal data across numerous fields. While diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in generating high-quality time series, they tend to be computationally demanding and reliant on complex stochastic processes. To address these limitations, we introduce FM-TS, a rectified Flow Matching-based framework for Time Series generation, which simplifies the time series generation process by directly optimizing continuous trajectories. This approach avoids the need for iterative sampling or complex noise schedules typically required in diffusion-based models. FM-TS is more efficient in terms of training and inference. Moreover, FM-TS is highly adaptive, supporting both conditional and unconditional time series generation. Notably, through our novel inference design, the model trained in an unconditional setting can seamlessly generalize to conditional tasks without the need for retraining. Extensive benchmarking across both settings demonstrates that FM-TS consistently delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches while being more efficient in terms of training and inference. For instance, in terms of discriminative score, FM-TS achieves 0.005, 0.019, 0.011, 0.005, 0.053, and 0.106 on the Sines, Stocks, ETTh, MuJoCo, Energy, and fMRI unconditional time series datasets, respectively, significantly outperforming the second-best method which achieves 0.006, 0.067, 0.061, 0.008, 0.122, and 0.167 on the same datasets. We have achieved superior performance in solar forecasting and MuJoCo imputation tasks, significantly enhanced by our innovative $t$ power sampling method.

      <title>Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-Markovian Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributionally robust offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find a policy that performs the best under the worst environment within an uncertainty set using an offline dataset collected from a nominal model. While recent advances in robust RL focus on Markov decision processes (MDPs), robust non-Markovian RL is limited to planning problem where the transitions in the uncertainty set are known. In this paper, we study the learning problem of robust offline non-Markovian RL. Specifically, when the nominal model admits a low-rank structure, we propose a new algorithm, featuring a novel dataset distillation and a lower confidence bound (LCB) design for robust values under different types of the uncertainty set. We also derive new dual forms for these robust values in non-Markovian RL, making our algorithm more amenable to practical implementation. By further introducing a novel type-I concentrability coefficient tailored for offline low-rank non-Markovian decision processes, we prove that our algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ offline samples. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the case when the nominal model does not have specific structure. With a new type-II concentrability coefficient, the extended algorithm also enjoys polynomial sample efficiency under all different types of the uncertainty set.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deep Learning Approach for Real-time Lane-based Arrival Curve Reconstruction at Intersection using License Plate Recognition Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acquisition of real-time and accurate traffic arrival information is of vital importance for proactive traffic control systems, especially in partially connected vehicle environments. License plate recognition (LPR) data that record both vehicle departures and identities are proven to be desirable in reconstructing lane-based arrival curves in previous works. Existing LPR databased methods are predominantly designed for reconstructing historical arrival curves. For real-time reconstruction of multi-lane urban roads, it is pivotal to determine the lane choice of real-time link-based arrivals, which has not been exploited in previous studies. In this study, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach for real-time lane-based arrival curve reconstruction, in which the lane choice patterns and uncertainties of link-based arrivals are both characterized. Specifically, the learning process is designed to effectively capture the relationship between partially observed link-based arrivals and lane-based arrivals, which can be physically interpreted as lane choice proportion. Moreover, the lane choice uncertainties are characterized using Bayesian parameter inference techniques, minimizing arrival curve reconstruction uncertainties, especially in low LPR data matching rate conditions. Real-world experiment results conducted in multiple matching rate scenarios demonstrate the superiority and necessity of lane choice modeling in reconstructing arrival curves.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and Federated Black-box Optimization: A Bayesian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on collaborative and federated black-box optimization (BBOpt), where agents optimize their heterogeneous black-box functions through collaborative sequential experimentation. From a Bayesian optimization perspective, we address the fundamental challenges of distributed experimentation, heterogeneity, and privacy within BBOpt, and propose three unifying frameworks to tackle these issues: (i) a global framework where experiments are centrally coordinated, (ii) a local framework that allows agents to make decisions based on minimal shared information, and (iii) a predictive framework that enhances local surrogates through collaboration to improve decision-making. We categorize existing methods within these frameworks and highlight key open questions to unlock the full potential of federated BBOpt. Our overarching goal is to shift federated learning from its predominantly descriptive/predictive paradigm to a prescriptive one, particularly in the context of BBOpt - an inherently sequential decision-making problem.</description>

      <title>Model Stealing for Any Low-Rank Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model stealing, where a learner tries to recover an unknown model via carefully chosen queries, is a critical problem in machine learning, as it threatens the security of proprietary models and the privacy of data they are trained on. In recent years, there has been particular interest in stealing large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we aim to build a theoretical understanding of stealing language models by studying a simple and mathematically tractable setting. We study model stealing for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and more generally low-rank language models.
  We assume that the learner works in the conditional query model, introduced by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang. Our main result is an efficient algorithm in the conditional query model, for learning any low-rank distribution. In other words, our algorithm succeeds at stealing any language model whose output distribution is low-rank. This improves upon the previous result by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang, which also requires the unknown distribution to have high "fidelity", a property that holds only in restricted cases. There are two key insights behind our algorithm: First, we represent the conditional distributions at each timestep by constructing barycentric spanners among a collection of vectors of exponentially large dimension. Second, for sampling from our representation, we iteratively solve a sequence of convex optimization problems that involve projection in relative entropy to prevent compounding of errors over the length of the sequence. This is an interesting example where, at least theoretically, allowing a machine learning model to solve more complex problems at inference time can lead to drastic improvements in its performance.</description>

      <title>Accident Impact Prediction based on a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic accidents pose a significant threat to public safety, resulting in numerous fatalities, injuries, and a substantial economic burden each year. The development of predictive models capable of real-time forecasting of post-accident impact using readily available data can play a crucial role in preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing overall safety. However, existing accident predictive models encounter two main challenges: first, reliance on either costly or non-real-time data, and second the absence of a comprehensive metric to measure post-accident impact accurately. To address these limitations, this study proposes a deep neural network model known as the cascade model. It leverages readily available real-world data from Los Angeles County to predict post-accident impacts. The model consists of two components: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM model captures temporal patterns, while the CNN extracts patterns from the sparse accident dataset. Furthermore, an external traffic congestion dataset is incorporated to derive a new feature called the "accident impact" factor, which quantifies the influence of an accident on surrounding traffic flow. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid machine learning method in predicting the post-accident impact compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The results reveal a higher precision in predicting minimal impacts (i.e., cases with no reported accidents) and a higher recall in predicting more significant impacts (i.e., cases with reported accidents).</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Gradient Descent Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success across various domains, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining its optimization dynamics is yet to be fully developed. In this study, we aim to bridge this understanding gap by answering the following two core questions: (1) Which types of Transformer architectures allow Gradient Descent (GD) to achieve guaranteed convergence? and (2) Under what initial conditions and architectural specifics does the Transformer achieve rapid convergence during training? By analyzing the loss landscape of a single Transformer layer using Softmax and Gaussian attention kernels, our work provides concrete answers to these questions. Our findings demonstrate that, with appropriate weight initialization, GD can train a Transformer model (with either kernel type) to achieve a global optimal solution, especially when the input embedding dimension is large. Nonetheless, certain scenarios highlight potential pitfalls: training a Transformer using the Softmax attention kernel may sometimes lead to suboptimal local solutions. In contrast, the Gaussian attention kernel exhibits a much favorable behavior. Our empirical study further validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Zer0-Jack: A Memory-efficient Gradient-based Jailbreaking Method for Black-box Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaking methods, which induce Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to output harmful responses, raise significant safety concerns. Among these methods, gradient-based approaches, which use gradients to generate malicious prompts, have been widely studied due to their high success rates in white-box settings, where full access to the model is available. However, these methods have notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always feasible, and involve high memory usage. To address scenarios where white-box access is unavailable, attackers often resort to transfer attacks. In transfer attacks, malicious inputs generated using white-box models are applied to black-box models, but this typically results in reduced attack performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Zer0-Jack, a method that bypasses the need for white-box access by leveraging zeroth-order optimization. We propose patch coordinate descent to efficiently generate malicious image inputs to directly attack black-box MLLMs, which significantly reduces memory usage further. Through extensive experiments, Zer0-Jack achieves a high attack success rate across various models, surpassing previous transfer-based methods and performing comparably with existing white-box jailbreak techniques. Notably, Zer0-Jack achieves a 95\% attack success rate on MiniGPT-4 with the Harmful Behaviors Multi-modal Dataset on a black-box setting, demonstrating its effectiveness. Additionally, we show that Zer0-Jack can directly attack commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o. Codes are provided in the supplement.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Tabular Data towards Better One-Class Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection under the one-class classification setting poses a significant challenge, as it involves accurately conceptualizing "normal" derived exclusively from a single category to discern anomalies from normal data variations. Capturing the intrinsic correlation among attributes within normal samples presents one promising method for learning the concept. To do so, the most recent effort relies on a learnable mask strategy with a reconstruction task. However, this wisdom may suffer from the risk of producing uniform masks, i.e., essentially nothing is masked, leading to less effective correlation learning. To address this issue, we presume that attributes related to others in normal samples can be divided into two non-overlapping and correlated subsets, defined as CorrSets, to capture the intrinsic correlation effectively. Accordingly, we introduce an innovative method that disentangles CorrSets from normal tabular data. To our knowledge, this is a pioneering effort to apply the concept of disentanglement for one-class anomaly detection on tabular data. Extensive experiments on 20 tabular datasets show that our method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and leads to an average performance improvement of 6.1% on AUC-PR and 2.1% on AUC-ROC.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality in Reinforcement Learning Through Approximate Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which refers to the fact that large-scale problems often lead to exponentially high sample complexity. A common solution is to use deep neural networks for function approximation; however, such approaches typically lack theoretical guarantees. To provably address the curse of dimensionality, we observe that many real-world problems exhibit task-specific model structures that, when properly leveraged, can improve the sample efficiency of RL. Building on this insight, we propose overcoming the curse of dimensionality by approximately factorizing the original Markov decision processes (MDPs) into smaller, independently evolving MDPs. This factorization enables the development of sample-efficient RL algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings, with the latter involving a variant of variance-reduced Q-learning. We provide improved sample complexity guarantees for both proposed algorithms. Notably, by leveraging model structure through the approximate factorization of the MDP, the dependence of sample complexity on the size of the state-action space can be exponentially reduced. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our proposed methods through experiments on both synthetic MDP tasks and a wind farm-equipped storage control problem.</description>

Abstract: In the post-training of large language models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach to achieve generation aligned with human preferences. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for policy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model. The objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages mode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that minimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference distribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this observation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for control over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's sharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our experiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks, demonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks. Moreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to the loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for wide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Circuit Complexity Bounds for RoPE-based Transformer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the express power of the Transformer architecture is critical to understanding its capacity limits and scaling law. Recent works provide the circuit complexity bounds to Transformer-like architecture. On the other hand, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has emerged as a crucial technique in modern large language models, offering superior performance in capturing positional information compared to traditional position embeddings, which shows great potential in application prospects, particularly for the long context scenario. Empirical evidence also suggests that $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architectures demonstrate greater generalization capabilities compared to conventional Transformer models. In this work, we establish a tighter circuit complexity bound for Transformers with $\mathsf{RoPE}$ attention. Our key contribution is that we show that unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision, $O(1)$ layers, hidden dimension $d \leq O(n)$ cannot solve the arithmetic problem or the Boolean formula value problem. This result significantly demonstrates the fundamental limitation of the expressivity of the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer architecture, although it achieves giant empirical success. Our theoretical framework not only establishes tighter complexity bounds but also may instruct further work on the $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Transformer.</description>

      <title>Top-$n\sigma$: Not All Logits Are You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically employ greedy decoding or low-temperature sampling for reasoning tasks, reflecting a perceived trade-off between diversity and accuracy. We challenge this convention by introducing top-$n\sigma$, a novel sampling method that operates directly on pre-softmax logits by leveraging a statistical threshold. Our key insight is that logits naturally separate into a Gaussian-distributed noisy region and a distinct informative region, enabling efficient token filtering without complex probability manipulations. Unlike existing methods (e.g., top-$p$, min-$p$) that inadvertently include more noise tokens at higher temperatures, top-$n\sigma$ maintains a stable sampling space regardless of temperature scaling. We also provide a theoretical analysis of top-$n\sigma$ to better understand its behavior. The extensive experimental results across four reasoning-focused datasets demonstrate that our method not only outperforms existing sampling approaches but also surpasses greedy decoding, while maintaining consistent performance even at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Is Graph Convolution Always Beneficial For Every Feature?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing structured data. While traditional GNNs typically treat each feature dimension equally during graph convolution, we raise an important question: Is the graph convolution operation equally beneficial for each feature? If not, the convolution operation on certain feature dimensions can possibly lead to harmful effects, even worse than the convolution-free models. In prior studies, to assess the impacts of graph convolution on features, people proposed metrics based on feature homophily to measure feature consistency with the graph topology. However, these metrics have shown unsatisfactory alignment with GNN performance and have not been effectively employed to guide feature selection in GNNs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel metric, Topological Feature Informativeness (TFI), to distinguish between GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features, where its effectiveness is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Based on TFI, we propose a simple yet effective Graph Feature Selection (GFS) method, which processes GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features separately, using GNNs and non-GNN models. Compared to original GNNs, GFS significantly improves the extraction of useful topological information from each feature with comparable computational costs. Extensive experiments show that after applying GFS to 8 baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures across 10 datasets, 83.75% of the GFS-augmented cases show significant performance boosts. Furthermore, our proposed TFI metric outperforms other feature selection methods. These results validate the effectiveness of both GFS and TFI. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFS's improvements are robust to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its potential as a universal method for enhancing various GNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Structure Learning For Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Structure Learning (GSL) has been extensively applied to reconstruct or refine original graph structures, effectively addressing issues like heterophily, over-squashing, and noisy structures. While GSL is generally thought to improve GNN performance, it often leads to longer training times and more hyperparameter tuning. Besides, the distinctions among current GSL methods remain ambiguous from the perspective of GNN training, and there is a lack of theoretical analysis to quantify their effectiveness. Recent studies further suggest that, under fair comparisons with the same hyperparameter tuning, GSL does not consistently outperform baseline GNNs. This motivates us to ask a critical question: is GSL really useful for GNNs? To address this question, this paper makes two key contributions. First, we propose a new GSL framework, which includes three steps: GSL base (the representation used for GSL) construction, new structure construction, and view fusion, to better understand the effectiveness of GSL in GNNs. Second, after graph convolution, we analyze the differences in mutual information (MI) between node representations derived from the original topology and those from the newly constructed topology. Surprisingly, our empirical observations and theoretical analysis show that no matter which type of graph structure construction methods are used, after feeding the same GSL bases to the newly constructed graph, there is no MI gain compared to the original GSL bases. To fairly reassess the effectiveness of GSL, we conduct ablation experiments and find that it is the pretrained GSL bases that enhance GNN performance, and in most cases, GSL cannot improve GNN performance. This finding encourages us to rethink the essential components in GNNs, such as self-training and structural encoding, in GNN design rather than GSL.</description>

      <title>Safe Exploitative Play with Untrusted Type Beliefs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of the Bayesian game and learning has a rich history, with the idea of controlling a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviors given a set of types, each specifying a possible behavior for the other agents. The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent's payoff. In particular, we formally define a tradeoff between risk and opportunity by comparing the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs. Our main results characterize the tradeoff by establishing upper and lower bounds on the Pareto front for both normal-form and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided.</description>

      <title>What Do Learning Dynamics Reveal About Generalization in LLM Reasoning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), the mechanisms behind their problem-solving abilities remain elusive. In this work, we aim to better understand how the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning shapes downstream generalization. Our analysis focuses on reasoning tasks, whose problem structure allows us to distinguish between memorization (the exact replication of reasoning steps from the training data) and performance (the correctness of the final solution). We find that a model's generalization behavior can be effectively characterized by a training metric we call pre-memorization train accuracy: the accuracy of model samples on training queries before they begin to copy the exact reasoning steps from the training set. On the dataset level, this metric is able to reliably predict test accuracy, achieving $R^2$ of around or exceeding 0.9 across various models (Llama3 8, Gemma2 9B), datasets (GSM8k, MATH), and training configurations. On a per-example level, this metric is also indicative of whether individual model predictions are robust to perturbations in the training query. By connecting a model's learning behavior to its generalization, pre-memorization train accuracy can guide targeted improvements to training strategies. We focus on data curation as an example, and show that prioritizing examples with low pre-memorization accuracy leads to 1.5-2x improvements in data efficiency compared to i.i.d. data scaling, and outperforms other standard data curation techniques.</description>

      <title>Test Where Decisions Matter: Importance-driven Testing for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, decisions in a trained policy vary in significance for the expected safety and performance of the policy. Since RL policies are very complex, testing efforts should concentrate on states in which the agent's decisions have the highest impact on the expected outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method to rigorously compute a ranking of state importance across the entire state space. We then focus our testing efforts on the highest-ranked states. In this paper, we focus on testing for safety. However, the proposed methods can be easily adapted to test for performance. In each iteration, our testing framework computes optimistic and pessimistic safety estimates. These estimates provide lower and upper bounds on the expected outcomes of the policy execution across all modeled states in the state space. Our approach divides the state space into safe and unsafe regions upon convergence, providing clear insights into the policy's weaknesses. Two important properties characterize our approach. (1) Optimal Test-Case Selection: At any time in the testing process, our approach evaluates the policy in the states that are most critical for safety. (2) Guaranteed Safety: Our approach can provide formal verification guarantees over the entire state space by sampling only a fraction of the policy. Any safety properties assured by the pessimistic estimate are formally proven to hold for the policy. We provide a detailed evaluation of our framework on several examples, showing that our method discovers unsafe policy behavior with low testing effort.</description>

      <title>OWLed: Outlier-weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous driving systems offers promising enhancements in environmental understanding and decision-making. However, the substantial computational demands of deploying LLMs locally on vehicles render this approach unfeasible for real-world automotive applications. To address this challenge, we introduce OWLed, the Outlier-Weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework that leverages outlier-weighted layerwise sparsity for model compression. Our method assigns non-uniform sparsity ratios to different layers based on the distribution of outlier features, significantly reducing the model size without the need for fine-tuning. To ensure the compressed model adapts well to autonomous driving tasks, we incorporate driving environment data into both the calibration and pruning processes. Our empirical studies reveal that the encoder component is more sensitive to pruning than the LLM, highlighting its critical role in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that OWLed outperforms existing methods in perception, action prediction, and language understanding while substantially lowering computational requirements. These findings underscore the potential of combining advanced pruning techniques with LLMs to develop efficient and robust autonomous driving systems capable of handling complex scenarios. Code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Analysis of LION</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LION (evoLved sIgn mOmeNtum) optimizer for deep neural network training was found by Google via program search, with the simple sign update yet showing impressive performance in training large scale networks. Although previous studies have investigated its convergence properties, a comprehensive analysis, especially the convergence rate, is still desirable. Recognizing that LION can be regarded as solving a specific constrained problem, this paper focuses on demonstrating its convergence to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at the rate of $\cal O(\sqrt{d}K^{-1/4})$ measured by gradient $\ell_1$ norm, where $d$ is the problem dimension and $K$ is the number of iteration steps. Step further, we remove the constraint and establish that LION converges to the critical point of the general unconstrained problem at the same rate. This rate not only delivers the currently optimal dependence on the problem dimension $d$ but also tightly matches the theoretical lower bound for nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms, which is typically measured using the gradient $\ell_2$ norm, with respect to the number of iterations $K$. Through extensive experiments, we not only demonstrate that LION achieves lower loss and higher performance compared to standard SGD, but also empirically confirm that the gradient $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm ratio aligns with $\Theta(\sqrt{d})$, thus proving that our convergence rate matches the theoretical lower bound with respect to $d$ in the empirical sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss several aspects of the loss landscape of regularized neural networks: the structure of stationary points, connectivity of optimal solutions, path with nonincreasing loss to arbitrary global optimum, and the nonuniqueness of optimal solutions, by casting the problem into an equivalent convex problem and considering its dual. Starting from two-layer neural networks with scalar output, we first characterize the solution set of the convex problem using its dual and further characterize all stationary points. With the characterization, we show that the topology of the global optima goes through a phase transition as the width of the network changes, and construct counterexamples where the problem may have a continuum of optimal solutions. Finally, we show that the solution set characterization and connectivity results can be extended to different architectures, including two-layer vector-valued neural networks and parallel three-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spatially Regularized Graph Attention Autoencoder Framework for Detecting Rainfall Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Graph Attention Autoencoder (GAE) with spatial regularization to address the challenge of scalable anomaly detection in spatiotemporal rainfall data across India from 1990 to 2015. Our model leverages a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics in the data, further enhanced by a spatial regularization term ensuring geographic coherence. We construct two graph datasets employing rainfall, pressure, and temperature attributes from the Indian Meteorological Department and ERA5 Reanalysis on Single Levels, respectively. Our network operates on graph representations of the data, where nodes represent geographic locations, and edges, inferred through event synchronization, denote significant co-occurrences of rainfall events. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our GAE effectively identifies anomalous rainfall patterns across the Indian landscape. Our work paves the way for sophisticated spatiotemporal anomaly detection methodologies in climate science, contributing to better climate change preparedness and response strategies.</description>

      <title>Navigation with QPHIL: Quantizing Planner for Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful alternative to imitation learning for behavior modeling in various domains, particularly in complex navigation tasks. An existing challenge with Offline RL is the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. how to mitigate incorrect policy updates due to errors in value estimates. Towards this, multiple works have demonstrated the advantage of hierarchical offline RL methods, which decouples high-level path planning from low-level path following. In this work, we present a novel hierarchical transformer-based approach leveraging a learned quantizer of the space. This quantization enables the training of a simpler zone-conditioned low-level policy and simplifies planning, which is reduced to discrete autoregressive prediction. Among other benefits, zone-level reasoning in planning enables explicit trajectory stitching rather than implicit stitching based on noisy value function estimates. By combining this transformer-based planner with recent advancements in offline RL, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in complex long-distance navigation environments.</description>

      <title>ASER: Activation Smoothing and Error Reconstruction for Large Language Model Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization stands as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) serving, yet it poses significant challenges particularly in achieving effective low-bit quantization. The limited numerical mapping makes the quantized model produce a non-trivial error, bringing out intolerable performance degration. This paper is anchored in the basic idea of model compression objectives, and delves into the layer-wise error distribution of LLMs during post-training quantization. Subsequently, we introduce ASER, an algorithm consisting of (1) Error Reconstruction: low-rank compensation for quantization error with LoRA-style matrices constructed by whitening SVD; (2) Activation Smoothing: outlier extraction to gain smooth activation and better error compensation. ASER is capable of quantizing typical LLMs to low-bit ones, particularly preserving accuracy even in W4A8 per-channel setup. Experimental results show that ASER is competitive among the state-of-the-art quantization algorithms, showing potential to activation quantization, with minor overhead.</description>

      <title>Automatic Album Sequencing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process. Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user interface, and this -- alongside a full copy of our implementation -- is publicly available at https://github.com/dylanashley/automatic-album-sequencing</description>

      <title>Interaction Asymmetry: A General Principle for Learning Composable Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning disentangled representations of concepts and re-composing them in unseen ways is crucial for generalizing to out-of-domain situations. However, the underlying properties of concepts that enable such disentanglement and compositional generalization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose the principle of interaction asymmetry which states: "Parts of the same concept have more complex interactions than parts of different concepts". We formalize this via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the generator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of "complexity" correspond to different $n$. Using this formalism, we prove that interaction asymmetry enables both disentanglement and compositional generalization. Our results unify recent theoretical results for learning concepts of objects, which we show are recovered as special cases with $n\!=\!0$ or $1$. We provide results for up to $n\!=\!2$, thus extending these prior works to more flexible generator functions, and conjecture that the same proof strategies generalize to larger $n$. Practically, our theory suggests that, to disentangle concepts, an autoencoder should penalize its latent capacity and the interactions between concepts during decoding. We propose an implementation of these criteria using a flexible Transformer-based VAE, with a novel regularizer on the attention weights of the decoder. On synthetic image datasets consisting of objects, we provide evidence that this model can achieve comparable object disentanglement to existing models that use more explicit object-centric priors.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based retrieval models for hyperspectral image data optimized with Kernel Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel-based statistical methods are efficient, but their performance depends heavily on the selection of kernel parameters. In literature, the optimization studies on kernel-based chemometric methods is limited and often reduced to grid searching. Previously, the authors introduced Kernel Flows (KF) to learn kernel parameters for Kernel Partial Least-Squares (K-PLS) regression. KF is easy to implement and helps minimize overfitting. In cases of high collinearity between spectra and biogeophysical quantities in spectroscopy, simpler methods like Principal Component Regression (PCR) may be more suitable. In this study, we propose a new KF-type approach to optimize Kernel Principal Component Regression (K-PCR) and test it alongside KF-PLS. Both methods are benchmarked against non-linear regression techniques using two hyperspectral remote sensing datasets.</description>

      <title>Federated Low-Rank Adaptation with Differential Privacy over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models (FMs) on distributed edge devices presents considerable computational and privacy challenges. Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) mitigates some privacy issues by facilitating collaborative model training without the need to share raw data. To lessen the computational burden on resource-limited devices, combining low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with federated learning enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Additionally, the split FedFT architecture partitions an FM between edge devices and a central server, reducing the necessity for complete model deployment on individual devices. However, the risk of privacy eavesdropping attacks in FedFT remains a concern, particularly in sensitive areas such as healthcare and finance. In this paper, we propose a split FedFT framework with differential privacy (DP) over wireless networks, where the inherent wireless channel noise in the uplink transmission is utilized to achieve DP guarantees without adding an extra artificial noise. We shall investigate the impact of the wireless noise on convergence performance of the proposed framework. We will also show that by updating only one of the low-rank matrices in the split FedFT with DP, the proposed method can mitigate the noise amplification effect. Simulation results will demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy under strict privacy budgets compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Dual-Criterion Model Aggregation in Federated Learning: Balancing Data Quantity and Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become one of the key methods for privacy-preserving collaborative learning, as it enables the transfer of models without requiring local data exchange. Within the FL framework, an aggregation algorithm is recognized as one of the most crucial components for ensuring the efficacy and security of the system. Existing average aggregation algorithms typically assume that all client-trained data holds equal value or that weights are based solely on the quantity of data contributed by each client. In contrast, alternative approaches involve training the model locally after aggregation to enhance adaptability. However, these approaches fundamentally ignore the inherent heterogeneity between different clients' data and the complexity of variations in data at the aggregation stage, which may lead to a suboptimal global model.
  To address these issues, this study proposes a novel dual-criterion weighted aggregation algorithm involving the quantity and quality of data from the client node. Specifically, we quantify the data used for training and perform multiple rounds of local model inference accuracy evaluation on a specialized dataset to assess the data quality of each client. These two factors are utilized as weights within the aggregation process, applied through a dynamically weighted summation of these two factors. This approach allows the algorithm to adaptively adjust the weights, ensuring that every client can contribute to the global model, regardless of their data's size or initial quality. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several existing state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on both a general-purpose open-source dataset, CIFAR-10, and a dataset specific to visual obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Federated Finetuning of Tiny Transformers with Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) through Transformer structures have dominated many machine learning tasks, especially text processing. However, these models require massive amounts of data for training and induce high resource requirements, particularly in terms of the large number of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) and the high amounts of memory needed. To fine-tune such a model in a parameter-efficient way, techniques like Adapter or LoRA have been developed. However, we observe that the application of LoRA, when used in federated learning (FL), while still being parameter-efficient, is memory and FLOP inefficient. Based on that observation, we develop a novel layer finetuning scheme that allows devices in cross-device FL to make use of pretrained neural networks (NNs) while adhering to given resource constraints. We show that our presented scheme outperforms the current state of the art when dealing with homogeneous or heterogeneous computation and memory constraints and is on par with LoRA regarding limited communication, thereby achieving significantly higher accuracies in FL training.</description>

      <title>Suite-IN: Aggregating Motion Features from Apple Suite for Robust Inertial Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of wearable technology, devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and headphones equipped with IMUs have become essential for applications such as pedestrian positioning. However, traditional pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) methods struggle with diverse motion patterns, while recent data-driven approaches, though improving accuracy, often lack robustness due to reliance on a single device.In our work, we attempt to enhance the positioning performance using the low-cost commodity IMUs embedded in the wearable devices. We propose a multi-device deep learning framework named Suite-IN, aggregating motion data from Apple Suite for inertial navigation. Motion data captured by sensors on different body parts contains both local and global motion information, making it essential to reduce the negative effects of localized movements and extract global motion representations from multiple devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamical-VAE-based Hindsight to Learn the Causal Dynamics of Factored-POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning representations of underlying environmental dynamics from partial observations is a critical challenge in machine learning. In the context of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), state representations are often inferred from the history of past observations and actions. We demonstrate that incorporating future information is essential to accurately capture causal dynamics and enhance state representations. To address this, we introduce a Dynamical Variational Auto-Encoder (DVAE) designed to learn causal Markovian dynamics from offline trajectories in a POMDP. Our method employs an extended hindsight framework that integrates past, current, and multi-step future information within a factored-POMDP setting. Empirical results reveal that this approach uncovers the causal graph governing hidden state transitions more effectively than history-based and typical hindsight-based models.</description>

      <title>FRUGAL: Memory-Efficient Optimization by Reducing State Overhead for Scalable Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increase in the number of parameters in large language models, the process of pre-training and fine-tuning increasingly demands larger volumes of GPU memory. A significant portion of this memory is typically consumed by the optimizer state. To overcome this challenge, recent approaches such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA (Hu et al., 2021)), low-rank gradient projection (GaLore (Zhao et al., 2024)), and blockwise optimization (BAdam (Luo et al., 2024)) have been proposed. However, in all these algorithms, the $\textit{effective rank of the weight updates remains low-rank}$, which can lead to a substantial loss of information from the gradient. This loss can be critically important, especially during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ ($\textbf{F}$ull-$\textbf{R}$ank $\textbf{U}$pdates with $\textbf{G}$r$\textbf{A}$dient sp$\textbf{L}$itting), a new memory-efficient optimization framework. $\texttt{FRUGAL}$ leverages gradient splitting to perform low-dimensional updates using advanced algorithms (such as Adam), while updates along the remaining directions are executed via state-free methods like SGD or signSGD (Bernstein et al., 2018). Our framework can be integrated with various low-rank update selection techniques, including GaLore and BAdam. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our framework when using SGDM for low-dimensional updates and SGD for state-free updates. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms concurrent approaches across various fixed memory budgets, achieving state-of-the-art results in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks while balancing memory efficiency and performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Evidential time-to-event prediction model with well-calibrated uncertainty estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-to-event analysis, or Survival analysis, provides valuable insights into clinical prognosis and treatment recommendations. However, this task is typically more challenging than other regression tasks due to the censored observations. Moreover, concerns regarding the reliability of predictions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration of prediction. To address those challenges, we introduce an evidential regression model designed especially for time-to-event prediction tasks, with which the most plausible event time, is directly quantified by aggregated Gaussian random fuzzy numbers (GRFNs). The GRFNs are a newly introduced family of random fuzzy subsets of the real line that generalizes both Gaussian random variables and Gaussian possibility distributions. Different from conventional methods that construct models based on strict data distribution, e.g., proportional hazard function, our model only assumes the event time is encoded in a real line GFRN without any strict distribution assumption, therefore offering more flexibility in complex data scenarios. Furthermore, the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty regarding the event time is quantified within the aggregated GRFN as well. Our model can, therefore, provide more detailed clinical decision-making guidance with two more degrees of information. The model is fit by minimizing a generalized negative log-likelihood function that accounts for data censoring based on uncertainty evidence reasoning. Experimental results on simulated datasets with varying data distributions and censoring scenarios, as well as on real-world datasets across diverse clinical settings and tasks, demonstrate that our model achieves both accurate and reliable performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Diverse capability and scaling of diffusion and auto-regressive models when learning abstract rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans excel at discovering regular structures from limited samples and applying inferred rules to novel settings. We investigate whether modern generative models can similarly learn underlying rules from finite samples and perform reasoning through conditional sampling. Inspired by Raven's Progressive Matrices task, we designed GenRAVEN dataset, where each sample consists of three rows, and one of 40 relational rules governing the object position, number, or attributes applies to all rows. We trained generative models to learn the data distribution, where samples are encoded as integer arrays to focus on rule learning. We compared two generative model families: diffusion (EDM, DiT, SiT) and autoregressive models (GPT2, Mamba). We evaluated their ability to generate structurally consistent samples and perform panel completion via unconditional and conditional sampling. We found diffusion models excel at unconditional generation, producing more novel and consistent samples from scratch and memorizing less, but performing less well in panel completion, even with advanced conditional sampling methods. Conversely, autoregressive models excel at completing missing panels in a rule-consistent manner but generate less consistent samples unconditionally. We observe diverse data scaling behaviors: for both model families, rule learning emerges at a certain dataset size - around 1000s examples per rule. With more training data, diffusion models improve both their unconditional and conditional generation capabilities. However, for autoregressive models, while panel completion improves with more training data, unconditional generation consistency declines. Our findings highlight complementary capabilities and limitations of diffusion and autoregressive models in rule learning and reasoning tasks, suggesting avenues for further research into their mechanisms and potential for human-like reasoning.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Optimization Framework for Private and Fair Learning From Decentralized Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often trained on sensitive data (e.g., medical records and race/gender) that is distributed across different "silos" (e.g., hospitals). These federated learning models may then be used to make consequential decisions, such as allocating healthcare resources. Two key challenges emerge in this setting: (i) maintaining the privacy of each person's data, even if other silos or an adversary with access to the central server tries to infer this data; (ii) ensuring that decisions are fair to different demographic groups (e.g., race/gender). In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm for private and fair federated learning (FL). Our algorithm satisfies inter-silo record-level differential privacy (ISRL-DP), a strong notion of private FL requiring that silo i's sent messages satisfy record-level differential privacy for all i. Our framework can be used to promote different fairness notions, including demographic parity and equalized odds. We prove that our algorithm converges under mild smoothness assumptions on the loss function, whereas prior work required strong convexity for convergence. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first convergence guarantee for ISRL-DP nonconvex-strongly concave min-max FL. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art fairness-accuracy tradeoffs of our algorithm across different privacy levels.</description>

      <title>Doubly Mild Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from the extrapolation error and value overestimation. From a generalization perspective, this issue can be attributed to the over-generalization of value functions or policies towards out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Significant efforts have been devoted to mitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches have further succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mild generalization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve performance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalization in offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mild action generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The former refers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximize the Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still be propagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this, the latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagation without impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMG guarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle generalization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still control value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the performance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance across Gym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefiting from its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamless transition from offline to online learning and attains strong online fine-tuning performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, integrating an agent's history into memory poses a significant challenge for decision-making. Traditional imitation learning, relying on observation-action pairs for expert demonstrations, fails to capture the expert's memory mechanisms used in decision-making. To capture memory processes as demonstrations, we introduce the concept of \textbf{memory dependency pairs} $(p, q)$ indicating that events at time $p$ are recalled for decision-making at time $q$. We introduce \textbf{AttentionTuner} to leverage memory dependency pairs in Transformers and find significant improvements across several tasks compared to standard Transformers when evaluated on Memory Gym and the Long-term Memory Benchmark.

      <title>On the Convergence of Continual Federated Learning Using Incrementally Aggregated Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holy grail of machine learning is to enable Continual Federated Learning (CFL) to enhance the efficiency, privacy, and scalability of AI systems while learning from streaming data. The primary challenge of a CFL system is to overcome global catastrophic forgetting, wherein the accuracy of the global model trained on new tasks declines on the old tasks. In this work, we propose Continual Federated Learning with Aggregated Gradients (C-FLAG), a novel replay-memory based federated strategy consisting of edge-based gradient updates on memory and aggregated gradients on the current data. We provide convergence analysis of the C-FLAG approach which addresses forgetting and bias while converging at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ over $T$ communication rounds. We formulate an optimization sub-problem that minimizes catastrophic forgetting, translating CFL into an iterative algorithm with adaptive learning rates that ensure seamless learning across tasks. We empirically show that C-FLAG outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on both task and class-incremental settings with respect to metrics such as accuracy and forgetting.</description>

      <title>Sleep Staging from Airflow Signals Using Fourier Approximations of Persistence Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep staging is a challenging task, typically manually performed by sleep technologists based on electroencephalogram and other biosignals of patients taken during overnight sleep studies. Recent work aims to leverage automated algorithms to perform sleep staging not based on electroencephalogram signals, but rather based on the airflow signals of subjects. Prior work uses ideas from topological data analysis (TDA), specifically Hermite function expansions of persistence curves (HEPC) to featurize airflow signals. However, finite order HEPC captures only partial information. In this work, we propose Fourier approximations of persistence curves (FAPC), and use this technique to perform sleep staging based on airflow signals. We analyze performance using an XGBoost model on 1155 pediatric sleep studies taken from the Nationwide Children's Hospital Sleep DataBank (NCHSDB), and find that FAPC methods provide complimentary information to HEPC methods alone, leading to a 4.9% increase in performance over baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Exact, Tractable Gauss-Newton Optimization in Deep Reversible Architectures Reveal Poor Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order optimization has been shown to accelerate the training of deep neural networks in many applications, often yielding faster progress per iteration on the training loss compared to first-order optimizers.However, the generalization properties of second-order methods are still being debated. Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the tractable settings of heavily simplified model classes -- thus, the relevance of existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear. Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are significantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates in practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour arises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or instead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\ Kronecker) approximations used or any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show for the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable form in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently expressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit this novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the GN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch training setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the \emph{training} loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each mini-batchatch without producing the features that would support generalization to other mini-batches. We show that our experiments run in the ``lazy'' regime, in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes very little during the course of training. This behaviour is associated with having no significant changes in neural representations, explaining the lack of generalization.</description>

      <title>LLMPhy: Complex Physical Reasoning Using Large Language Models and World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reasoning is an important skill needed for robotic agents when operating in the real world. However, solving such reasoning problems often involves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions under the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such interactions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we propose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task involves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an external impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and their dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal of reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To solve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot black-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and program synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the world models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an LLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of the system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit analysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the loop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene towards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we present experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of the objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics engine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance, while demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box optimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.</description>

      <title>SPDIM: Source-Free Unsupervised Conditional and Label Shifts Adaptation in EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-stationary nature of electroencephalography (EEG) introduces distribution shifts across domains (e.g., days and subjects), posing a significant challenge to EEG-based neurotechnology generalization. Without labeled calibration data for target domains, the problem is a source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) problem. For scenarios with constant label distribution, Riemannian geometry-aware statistical alignment frameworks on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold are considered state-of-the-art. However, many practical scenarios, including EEG-based sleep staging, exhibit label shifts. Here, we propose a geometric deep learning framework for SFUDA problems under specific distribution shifts, including label shifts. We introduce a novel, realistic generative model and show that prior Riemannian statistical alignment methods on the SPD manifold can compensate for specific marginal and conditional distribution shifts but hurt generalization under label shifts. As a remedy, we propose a parameter-efficient manifold optimization strategy termed SPDIM. SPDIM uses the information maximization principle to learn a single SPD-manifold-constrained parameter per target domain. In simulations, we demonstrate that SPDIM can compensate for the shifts under our generative model. Moreover, using public EEG-based brain-computer interface and sleep staging datasets, we show that SPDIM outperforms prior approaches.</description>

      <title>High quality ECG dataset based on MIT-BIH recordings for improved heartbeats classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a reliable tool for medical professionals to detect and diagnose abnormal heart waves that may cause cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a methodology to create a new high-quality heartbeat dataset from all 48 of the MIT-BIH recordings. The proposed approach computes an optimal heartbeat size, by eliminating outliers and calculating the mean value over 10-second windows. This results in independent QRS-centered heartbeats avoiding the mixing of successive heartbeats problem. The quality of the newly constructed dataset has been evaluated and compared with existing datasets. To this end, we built and trained a PyTorch 1-D Resnet architecture model that achieved 99.24\% accuracy with a 5.7\% improvement compared to other methods. Additionally, downsampling the dataset has improved the model's execution time by 33\% and reduced 3x memory usage.</description>

      <title>ASTD Patterns for Integrated Continuous Anomaly Detection In Data Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of the ASTD language for ensemble anomaly detection in data logs. It uses a sliding window technique for continuous learning in data streams, coupled with updating learning models upon the completion of each window to maintain accurate detection and align with current data trends. It proposes ASTD patterns for combining learning models, especially in the context of unsupervised learning, which is commonly used for data streams. To facilitate this, a new ASTD operator is proposed, the Quantified Flow, which enables the seamless combination of learning models while ensuring that the specification remains concise. Our contribution is a specification pattern, highlighting the capacity of ASTDs to abstract and modularize anomaly detection systems. The ASTD language provides a unique approach to develop data flow anomaly detection systems, grounded in the combination of processes through the graphical representation of the language operators. This simplifies the design task for developers, who can focus primarily on defining the functional operations that constitute the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incorporation of quantum ansatz with machine learning classification models demonstrates the ability to extract patterns from data for classification tasks. However, taking advantage of the enhanced computational power of quantum machine learning necessitates dealing with various constraints. In this paper, we focus on constraints like finding suitable datasets where quantum advantage is achievable and evaluating the relevance of features chosen by classical and quantum methods. Additionally, we compare quantum and classical approaches using benchmarks and estimate the computational complexity of quantum circuits to assess real-world usability. For our experimental validation, we selected the gene expression dataset, given the critical role of genetic variations in regulating physiological behavior and disease susceptibility. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the advancement of quantum machine learning methodologies, offering valuable insights into their potential for addressing complex classification challenges in various domains.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian Processes face two primary challenges: constructing models for large datasets and selecting the optimal model. This master's thesis tackles these challenges in the low-dimensional case. We examine recent convergence results to identify models with optimal convergence rates and pinpoint essential parameters. Utilizing this model, we propose a Samplet-based approach to efficiently construct and train the Gaussian Processes, reducing the cubic computational complexity to a log-linear scale. This method facilitates optimal regression while maintaining efficient performance.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Abstract Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have shown impressive performance on tasks within their training distribution, but often struggle with novel problems requiring complex reasoning. We investigate the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT) -- updating model parameters temporarily during inference using a loss derived from input data -- as a mechanism for improving models' reasoning capabilities, using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) as a benchmark. Through systematic experimentation, we identify three crucial components for successful TTT: (1) initial finetuning on similar tasks (2) auxiliary task format and augmentations (3) per-instance training. TTT significantly improves performance on ARC tasks, achieving up to 6x improvement in accuracy compared to base fine-tuned models; applying TTT to an 8B-parameter language model, we achieve 53% accuracy on the ARC's public validation set, improving the state-of-the-art by nearly 25% for public and purely neural approaches. By ensembling our method with recent program generation approaches, we get SoTA public validation accuracy of 61.9%, matching the average human score. Our findings suggest that explicit symbolic search is not the only path to improved abstract reasoning in neural language models; additional test-time applied to continued training on few-shot examples can also be extremely effective.</description>

      <title>Merit-Based Sortition in Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decentralized systems, it is often necessary to select an 'active' subset of participants from the total participant pool, with the goal of satisfying computational limitations or optimizing resource efficiency. This selection can sometimes be made at random, mirroring the sortition practice invented in classical antiquity aimed at achieving a high degree of statistical representativeness. However, the recent emergence of specialized decentralized networks that solve concrete coordination problems and are characterized by measurable success metrics often requires prioritizing performance optimization over representativeness. We introduce a simple algorithm for 'merit-based sortition', in which the quality of each participant influences its probability of being drafted into the active set, while simultaneously retaining representativeness by allowing inactive participants an infinite number of chances to be drafted into the active set with non-zero probability. Using a suite of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the quality metric describing the performance of the active set by $&gt;2$ times the intrinsic stochasticity. This implies that merit-based sortition ensures a statistically significant performance boost to the drafted, 'active' set, while retaining the property of classical, random sortition that it enables upward mobility from a much larger 'inactive' set. This way, merit-based sortition fulfils a key requirement for decentralized systems in need of performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Richer Output for Richer Countries: Uncovering Geographical Disparities in Generated Stories and Travel Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a large body of work inspects language models for biases concerning gender, race, occupation and religion, biases of geographical nature are relatively less explored. Some recent studies benchmark the degree to which large language models encode geospatial knowledge. However, the impact of the encoded geographical knowledge (or lack thereof) on real-world applications has not been documented. In this work, we examine large language models for two common scenarios that require geographical knowledge: (a) travel recommendations and (b) geo-anchored story generation. Specifically, we study four popular language models, and across about $100$K travel requests, and $200$K story generations, we observe that travel recommendations corresponding to poorer countries are less unique with fewer location references, and stories from these regions more often convey emotions of hardship and sadness compared to those from wealthier nations.</description>

      <title>Factorised Active Inference for Strategic Multi-Agent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within collectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics, neuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be integrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how agents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour within their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between agents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the two, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent maintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other agents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our model to iterated general-sum games with 2 and 3 players, and study the ensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game payoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by reciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents need to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical analysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the expected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level EFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple Nash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not necessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game theory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge, learn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and non-cooperative.</description>

      <title>Just Label the Repeats for In-The-Wild Audio-to-Score Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient workflow for high-quality offline alignment of in-the-wild performance audio and corresponding sheet music scans (images). Recent work on audio-to-score alignment extends dynamic time warping (DTW) to be theoretically able to handle jumps in sheet music induced by repeat signs-this method requires no human annotations, but we show that it often yields low-quality alignments. As an alternative, we propose a workflow and interface that allows users to quickly annotate jumps (by clicking on repeat signs), requiring a small amount of human supervision but yielding much higher quality alignments on average. Additionally, we refine audio and score feature representations to improve alignment quality by: (1) integrating measure detection into the score feature representation, and (2) using raw onset prediction probabilities from a music transcription model instead of piano roll. We propose an evaluation protocol for audio-to-score alignment that computes the distance between the estimated and ground truth alignment in units of measures. Under this evaluation, we find that our proposed jump annotation workflow and improved feature representations together improve alignment accuracy by 150% relative to prior work (33% to 82%).</description>

      <title>Optimizing Data Delivery: Insights from User Preferences on Visuals, Tables, and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07451</link>

Abstract: In this work, we research user preferences to see a chart, table, or text given a question asked by the user. This enables us to understand when it is best to show a chart, table, or text to the user for the specific question. For this, we conduct a user study where users are shown a question and asked what they would prefer to see and used the data to establish that a user's personal traits does influence the data outputs that they prefer. Understanding how user characteristics impact a user's preferences is critical to creating data tools with a better user experience. Additionally, we investigate to what degree an LLM can be used to replicate a user's preference with and without user preference data. Overall, these findings have significant implications pertaining to the development of data tools and the replication of human preferences using LLMs. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential use of LLMs to replicate user preference data which has major implications for future user modeling and personalization research.</description>

      <title>MSEG-VCUQ: Multimodal SEGmentation with Enhanced Vision Foundation Models, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Uncertainty Quantification for High-Speed Video Phase Detection Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: High-speed video (HSV) phase detection (PD) segmentation is vital in nuclear reactors, chemical processing, and electronics cooling for detecting vapor, liquid, and microlayer phases. Traditional segmentation models face pixel-level accuracy and generalization issues in multimodal data. MSEG-VCUQ introduces VideoSAM, a hybrid framework leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based vision models to enhance segmentation accuracy and generalizability across complex multimodal PD tasks. Methods: VideoSAM combines U-Net CNN and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for advanced feature extraction and segmentation across diverse HSV PD modalities, spanning fluids like water, FC-72, nitrogen, and argon under varied heat flux conditions. The framework also incorporates uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess pixel-based discretization errors, delivering reliable metrics such as contact line density and dry area fraction under experimental conditions. Results: VideoSAM outperforms SAM and modality-specific CNN models in segmentation accuracy, excelling in environments with complex phase boundaries, overlapping bubbles, and dynamic liquid-vapor interactions. Its hybrid architecture supports cross-dataset generalization, adapting effectively to varying modalities. The UQ module provides accurate error estimates, enhancing the reliability of segmentation outputs for advanced HSV PD research. Conclusion: MSEG-VCUQ, via VideoSAM, offers a robust solution for HSV PD segmentation, addressing previous limitations with advanced deep learning and UQ techniques. The open-source datasets and tools introduced enable scalable, precise, and adaptable segmentation for multimodal PD datasets, supporting advancements in HSV analysis and autonomous experimentation.</description>

      <title>BudgetMLAgent: A Cost-Effective LLM Multi-Agent system for Automating Machine Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications including generation of code snippets, but often struggle with generating code for complex Machine Learning (ML) tasks. Although existing LLM single-agent based systems give varying performance depending on the task complexity, they purely rely on larger and expensive models such as GPT-4. Our investigation reveals that no-cost and low-cost models such as Gemini-Pro, Mixtral and CodeLlama perform far worse than GPT-4 in a single-agent setting. With the motivation of developing a cost-efficient LLM based solution for solving ML tasks, we propose an LLM Multi-Agent based system which leverages combination of experts using profiling, efficient retrieval of past observations, LLM cascades, and ask-the-expert calls. Through empirical analysis on ML engineering tasks in the MLAgentBench benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, using no-cost models, namely Gemini as the base LLM, paired with GPT-4 in cascade and expert to serve occasional ask-the-expert calls for planning. With 94.2\% reduction in the cost (from \$0.931 per run cost averaged over all tasks for GPT-4 single agent system to \$0.054), our system is able to yield better average success rate of 32.95\% as compared to GPT-4 single-agent system yielding 22.72\% success rate averaged over all the tasks of MLAgentBench.</description>

      <title>IdentifyMe: A Challenging Long-Context Mention Resolution Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evaluations of LLMs on coreference resolution have revealed that traditional output formats and evaluation metrics do not fully capture the models' referential understanding. To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Neural Network Inference Service</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized data analysis and pattern recognition, but its resource-intensive training has limited accessibility. Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) simplifies this by enabling users to delegate their data samples to an MLaaS provider and obtain the inference result using a pre-trained model. Despite its convenience, leveraging MLaaS poses significant privacy and reliability concerns to the client. Specifically, sensitive information from the client inquiry data can be leaked to an adversarial MLaaS provider. Meanwhile, the lack of a verifiability guarantee can potentially result in biased inference results or even unfair payment issues. While existing trustworthy machine learning techniques, such as those relying on verifiable computation or secure computation, offer solutions to privacy and reliability concerns, they fall short of simultaneously protecting the privacy of client data and providing provable inference verifiability.
  In this paper, we propose vPIN, a privacy-preserving and verifiable CNN inference scheme that preserves privacy for client data samples while ensuring verifiability for the inference. vPIN makes use of partial homomorphic encryption and commit-and-prove succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge techniques to achieve desirable security properties. In vPIN, we develop various optimization techniques to minimize the proving circuit for homomorphic inference evaluation thereby, improving the efficiency and performance of our technique. We fully implemented and evaluated our vPIN scheme on standard datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). Our experimental results show that vPIN achieves high efficiency in terms of proving time, verification time, and proof size, while providing client data privacy guarantees and provable verifiability.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Knowledge Distillation Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation provides an effective method for deploying complex machine learning models in resource-constrained environments. It typically involves training a smaller student model to emulate either the probabilistic outputs or the internal feature representations of a larger teacher model. By doing so, the student model often achieves substantially better performance on a downstream task compared to when it is trained independently. Nevertheless, the teacher's internal representations can also encode noise or additional information that may not be relevant to the downstream task. This observation motivates our primary question: What are the information-theoretic limits of knowledge transfer? To this end, we leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify the distillable and distilled knowledge of a teacher's representation corresponding to a given student and a downstream task. Moreover, we demonstrate that this metric can be practically used in distillation to address challenges caused by the complexity gap between the teacher and the student representations.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Structured Fractional Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of structured fractional minimization problems, where the numerator includes a differentiable function, a simple nonconvex nonsmooth function, a concave nonsmooth function, and a convex nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator, while the denominator is a continuous function that is either weakly convex or has a weakly convex square root. These problems are widespread and span numerous essential applications in machine learning and data science. Existing methods are mainly based on subgradient methods and smoothing proximal gradient methods, which may suffer from slow convergence and numerical stability issues. In this paper, we introduce {\sf FADMM}, the first Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers tailored for this class of problems. {\sf FADMM} decouples the original problem into linearized proximal subproblems, featuring two variants: one using Dinkelbach's parametric method ({\sf FADMM-D}) and the other using the quadratic transform method ({\sf FADMM-Q}). By introducing a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that {\sf FADMM} converges to $\epsilon$-approximate critical points of the problem within an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data for sparse Fisher discriminant analysis, robust Sharpe ratio minimization, and robust sparse recovery demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      <title>A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Radiotherapy: Leveraging the Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Ensuring the precision in motion tracking for MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is crucial for the delivery of effective treatments. This study refined the motion tracking accuracy in MRIgRT through the innovation of an automatic real-time tracking method, leveraging an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework coupled with automatic segmentation. Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking method by integrating two primary methods: the ETLD framework and an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The TLD framework was upgraded to suit real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. Additionally, ICV was combined for precise coverage of the target volume, which refined the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. Tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases, our method ensures precise tracking and accurate segmentation vital for MRIgRT. Results: An evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions revealed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects, underscoring the robustness and efficacy of the ETLD. Moreover, the ETLD+ICV yielded a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the proposed method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusions: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time motion tracking method for MRIgRT that markedly surpasses current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also demonstrates enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, positioning it as an indispensable asset in the quest to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.</description>

      <title>AdaS&amp;S: a One-Shot Supernet Approach for Automatic Embedding Size Search in Deep Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Model(DLRM)s utilize the embedding layer to represent various categorical features. Traditional DLRMs adopt unified embedding size for all features, leading to suboptimal performance and redundant parameters. Thus, lots of Automatic Embedding size Search (AES) works focus on obtaining mixed embedding sizes with strong model performance. However, previous AES works can hardly address several challenges together: (1) The search results of embedding sizes are unstable; (2) Recommendation effect with AES results is unsatisfactory; (3) Memory cost of embeddings is uncontrollable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-shot AES framework called AdaS&amp;S, in which a supernet encompassing various candidate embeddings is built and AES is performed as searching network architectures within it. Our framework contains two main stages: In the first stage, we decouple training parameters from searching embedding sizes, and propose the Adaptive Sampling method to yield a well-trained supernet, which further helps to produce stable AES results. In the second stage, to obtain embedding sizes that benefits the model effect, we design a reinforcement learning search process which utilizes the supernet trained previously. Meanwhile, to adapt searching to specific resource constraint, we introduce the resource competition penalty to balance the model effectiveness and memory cost of embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to show the superiority of AdaS&amp;S. Our method could improve AUC by about 0.3% while saving about 20% of model parameters. Empirical analysis also shows that the stability of searching results in AdaS&amp;S significantly exceeds other methods.</description>

      <title>SecEncoder: Logs are All You Need in Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large and Small Language Models (LMs) are typically pretrained using extensive volumes of text, which are sourced from publicly accessible platforms such as Wikipedia, Book Corpus, or through web scraping. These models, due to their exposure to a wide range of language data, exhibit impressive generalization capabilities and can perform a multitude of tasks simultaneously. However, they often fall short when it comes to domain-specific tasks due to their broad training data. This paper introduces SecEncoder, a specialized small language model that is pretrained using security logs. SecEncoder is designed to address the domain-specific limitations of general LMs by focusing on the unique language and patterns found in security logs. Experimental results indicate that SecEncoder outperforms other LMs, such as BERTlarge, DeBERTa-v3-large and OpenAI's Embedding (textembedding-ada-002) models, which are pretrained mainly on natural language, across various tasks. Furthermore, although SecEncoder is primarily pretrained on log data, it outperforms models pretrained on natural language for a range of tasks beyond log analysis, such as incident prioritization and threat intelligence document retrieval. This suggests that domain specific pretraining with logs can significantly enhance the performance of LMs in security. These findings pave the way for future research into security-specific LMs and their potential applications.</description>

Key to the effectiveness was the proper assignment of trackers to joint sets via modified task Jacobians and relaxed barrier functions for self-collision avoidance. The approach was validated on Apptronik's Astro hardware by demonstrating manipulation capabilities on a table-top environment with pick-and-place box packing and a two-handed box pick up and handover task.</description>

      <title>Exogenous Randomness Empowering Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We offer theoretical and empirical insights into the impact of exogenous randomness on the effectiveness of random forests with tree-building rules independent of training data. We formally introduce the concept of exogenous randomness and identify two types of commonly existing randomness: Type I from feature subsampling, and Type II from tie-breaking in tree-building processes. We develop non-asymptotic expansions for the mean squared error (MSE) for both individual trees and forests and establish sufficient and necessary conditions for their consistency. In the special example of the linear regression model with independent features, our MSE expansions are more explicit, providing more understanding of the random forests' mechanisms. It also allows us to derive an upper bound on the MSE with explicit consistency rates for trees and forests. Guided by our theoretical findings, we conduct simulations to further explore how exogenous randomness enhances random forest performance. Our findings unveil that feature subsampling reduces both the bias and variance of random forests compared to individual trees, serving as an adaptive mechanism to balance bias and variance. Furthermore, our results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the presence of noise features can act as a "blessing" in enhancing the performance of random forests thanks to feature subsampling.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Inverse Consistent Diffeomorphic Lung Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic deformable image registration ensures smooth invertible transformations across inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans. Yet, in practice, deep learning-based diffeomorphic methods struggle to capture large deformations between inspiratory and expiratory volumes, and therefore lack inverse consistency. Existing methods also fail to account for model uncertainty, which can be useful for improving performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware test-time adaptation framework for inverse consistent diffeomorphic lung registration. Our method uses Monte Carlo (MC) dropout to estimate spatial uncertainty that is used to improve model performance. We train and evaluate our method for inspiratory-to-expiratory CT registration on a large cohort of 675 subjects from the COPDGene study, achieving a higher Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the lung boundaries (0.966) compared to both VoxelMorph (0.953) and TransMorph (0.953). Our method demonstrates consistent improvements in the inverse registration direction as well with an overall DSC of 0.966, higher than VoxelMorph (0.958) and TransMorph (0.956). Paired t-tests indicate statistically significant improvements.</description>

      <title>Decision Feedback In-Context Symbol Detection over Block-Fading Channels</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained Transformers, through in-context learning (ICL), have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to adapt to new tasks using example prompts \textit{without model update}. Transformer-based wireless receivers, where prompts consist of the pilot data in the form of transmitted and received signal pairs, have shown high estimation accuracy when pilot data are abundant. However, pilot information is often costly and limited in practice. In this work, we propose the \underline{DE}cision \underline{F}eedback \underline{IN}-Cont\underline{E}xt \underline{D}etection (DEFINED) solution as a new wireless receiver design, which bypasses channel estimation and directly performs symbol detection using the (sometimes extremely) limited pilot data. The key innovation in DEFINED is the proposed decision feedback mechanism in ICL, where we sequentially incorporate the detected symbols into the prompts to improve the detections for subsequent symbols. Extensive experiments across a broad range of wireless communication settings demonstrate that DEFINED achieves significant performance improvements, in some cases only needing a single pilot pair.</description>

      <title>SegQC: a segmentation network-based framework for multi-metric segmentation quality control and segmentation error detection in volumetric medical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality control of structures segmentation in volumetric medical images is important for identifying segmentation errors in clinical practice and for facilitating model development. This paper introduces SegQC, a novel framework for segmentation quality estimation and segmentation error detection. SegQC computes an estimate measure of the quality of a segmentation in volumetric scans and in their individual slices and identifies possible segmentation error regions within a slice. The key components include: 1. SegQC-Net, a deep network that inputs a scan and its segmentation mask and outputs segmentation error probabilities for each voxel in the scan; 2. three new segmentation quality metrics, two overlap metrics and a structure size metric, computed from the segmentation error probabilities; 3. a new method for detecting possible segmentation errors in scan slices computed from the segmentation error probabilities. We introduce a new evaluation scheme to measure segmentation error discrepancies based on an expert radiologist corrections of automatically produced segmentations that yields smaller observer variability and is closer to actual segmentation errors. We demonstrate SegQC on three fetal structures in 198 fetal MRI scans: fetal brain, fetal body and the placenta. To assess the benefits of SegQC, we compare it to the unsupervised Test Time Augmentation (TTA)-based quality estimation. Our studies indicate that SegQC outperforms TTA-based quality estimation in terms of Pearson correlation and MAE for fetal body and fetal brain structures segmentation. Our segmentation error detection method achieved recall and precision rates of 0.77 and 0.48 for fetal body, and 0.74 and 0.55 for fetal brain segmentation error detection respectively. SegQC enhances segmentation metrics estimation for whole scans and individual slices, as well as provides error regions detection.</description>

      <title>CJST: CTC Compressor based Joint Speech and Text Training for Decoder-Only ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CTC compressor can be an effective approach to integrate audio encoders to decoder-only models, which has gained growing interest for different speech applications. In this work, we propose a novel CTC compressor based joint speech and text training (CJST) framework for decoder-only ASR. CJST matches speech and text modalities from both directions by exploring a simple modality adaptor and several features of the CTC compressor, including sequence compression, on-the-fly forced peaky alignment and CTC class embeddings. Experimental results on the Librispeech and TED-LIUM2 corpora show that the proposed CJST achieves an effective text injection without the need of duration handling, leading to the best performance for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. We also provide a comprehensive study on CTC compressor, covering various compression modes, edge case handling and behavior under both clean and noisy data conditions, which reveals the most robust setting to use CTC compressor for decoder-only models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scheduling problems pose significant challenges in resource, industry, and operational management. This paper addresses the Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (UPMS) with setup times and resources using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The study introduces the Reinforcement Learning environment and conducts empirical analyses, comparing MARL with Single-Agent algorithms. The experiments employ various deep neural network policies for single- and Multi-Agent approaches. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Maskable extension of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in Single-Agent scenarios and the Multi-Agent PPO algorithm in Multi-Agent setups. While Single-Agent algorithms perform adequately in reduced scenarios, Multi-Agent approaches reveal challenges in cooperative learning but a scalable capacity. This research contributes insights into applying MARL techniques to scheduling optimization, emphasizing the need for algorithmic sophistication balanced with scalability for intelligent scheduling solutions.</description>

      <title>xCG: Explainable Cell Graphs for Survival Prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how deep learning models predict oncology patient risk can provide critical insights into disease progression, support clinical decision-making, and pave the way for trustworthy and data-driven precision medicine. Building on recent advances in the spatial modeling of the tumor microenvironment using graph neural networks, we present an explainable cell graph (xCG) approach for survival prediction. We validate our model on a public cohort of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data for 416 cases of lung adenocarcinoma. We explain survival predictions in terms of known phenotypes on the cell level by computing risk attributions over cell graphs, for which we propose an efficient grid-based layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of incorporating the cancer stage and model ensembling to improve the quality of risk estimates. Our xCG method, together with the IMC data, is made publicly available to support further research.</description>

      <title>Understanding Audiovisual Deepfake Detection: Techniques, Challenges, Human Factors and Perceptual Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning has been successfully applied in diverse fields, and its impact on deepfake detection is no exception. Deepfakes are fake yet realistic synthetic content that can be used deceitfully for political impersonation, phishing, slandering, or spreading misinformation. Despite extensive research on unimodal deepfake detection, identifying complex deepfakes through joint analysis of audio and visual streams remains relatively unexplored. To fill this gap, this survey first provides an overview of audiovisual deepfake generation techniques, applications, and their consequences, and then provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods that combine audio and visual modalities to enhance detection accuracy, summarizing and critically analyzing their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss existing open source datasets for a deeper understanding, which can contribute to the research community and provide necessary information to beginners who want to analyze deep learning-based audiovisual methods for video forensics. By bridging the gap between unimodal and multimodal approaches, this paper aims to improve the effectiveness of deepfake detection strategies and guide future research in cybersecurity and media integrity.</description>

      <title>EMPERROR: A Flexible Generative Perception Error Model for Probing Self-Driving Planners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To handle the complexities of real-world traffic, learning planners for self-driving from data is a promising direction. While recent approaches have shown great progress, they typically assume a setting in which the ground-truth world state is available as input. However, when deployed, planning needs to be robust to the long-tail of errors incurred by a noisy perception system, which is often neglected in evaluation. To address this, previous work has proposed drawing adversarial samples from a perception error model (PEM) mimicking the noise characteristics of a target object detector. However, these methods use simple PEMs that fail to accurately capture all failure modes of detection. In this paper, we present EMPERROR, a novel transformer-based generative PEM, apply it to stress-test an imitation learning (IL)-based planner and show that it imitates modern detectors more faithfully than previous work. Furthermore, it is able to produce realistic noisy inputs that increase the planner's collision rate by up to 85%, demonstrating its utility as a valuable tool for a more complete evaluation of self-driving planners.</description>

      <title>Likelihood as a Performance Gauge for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work finds that retrieval-augmented generation with large language models is prone to be influenced by the order of retrieved documents in the context. However, the lack of in-depth analysis limits the use of this phenomenon for prompt engineering in practice. In this study, we posit that likelihoods serve as an effective gauge for language model performance. Through experiments on two question-answering datasets with a variety of state-of-the-art language models, we reveal correlations between answer accuracy and the likelihood of the question at both the corpus level and the instance level. In addition, we find that question likelihood can also indicate the position of the task-relevant information in the context. Based on these findings, we propose two methods that use question likelihood as a gauge for selecting and constructing prompts that lead to better performance. We demonstrate their effectiveness with experiments. In addition, our likelihood-based methods are efficient, as they only need to compute the likelihood of the input, requiring much fewer language model passes than heuristic prompt engineering methods that require generating responses. Our analysis deepens our understanding of how input prompts affect model performance and provides a promising direction for efficient prompt optimization.</description>

      <title>PatchCTG: Patch Cardiotocography Transformer for Antepartum Fetal Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antepartum Cardiotocography (CTG) is vital for fetal health monitoring, but traditional methods like the Dawes-Redman system are often limited by high inter-observer variability, leading to inconsistent interpretations and potential misdiagnoses. This paper introduces PatchCTG, a transformer-based model specifically designed for CTG analysis, employing patch-based tokenisation, instance normalisation and channel-independent processing to capture essential local and global temporal dependencies within CTG signals. PatchCTG was evaluated on the Oxford Maternity (OXMAT) dataset, comprising over 20,000 CTG traces across diverse clinical outcomes after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. With extensive hyperparameter optimisation, PatchCTG achieved an AUC of 77%, with specificity of 88% and sensitivity of 57% at Youden's index threshold, demonstrating adaptability to various clinical needs. Testing across varying temporal thresholds showed robust predictive performance, particularly with finetuning on data closer to delivery, achieving a sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 88% for near-delivery cases. These findings suggest the potential of PatchCTG to enhance clinical decision-making in antepartum care by providing a reliable, objective tool for fetal health assessment.

      <title>Tucano: Advancing Neural Text Generation for Portuguese</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant advances have been made in natural language processing in recent years. However, our current deep learning approach to language modeling requires substantial resources in terms of data and computation. One of the side effects of this data-hungry paradigm is the current schism between languages, separating those considered high-resource, where most of the development happens and resources are available, and the low-resource ones, which struggle to attain the same level of performance and autonomy. This study aims to introduce a new set of resources to stimulate the future development of neural text generation in Portuguese. In this work, we document the development of GigaVerbo, a concatenation of deduplicated Portuguese text corpora amounting to 200 billion tokens. Via this corpus, we trained a series of decoder-transformers named Tucano. Our models perform equal or superior to other Portuguese and multilingual language models of similar size in several Portuguese benchmarks. The evaluation of our models also reveals that model performance on many currently available benchmarks used by the Portuguese NLP community has little to no correlation with the scaling of token ingestion during training, highlighting the limitations of such evaluations when it comes to the assessment of Portuguese generative language models. All derivatives of our study are openly released on GitHub and Hugging Face. See https://nkluge-correa.github.io/Tucano/</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex scenes and varied conditions, effectively integrating spatial-temporal context is crucial for accurately identifying changes. However, current RS-CD methods lack a balanced consideration of performance and efficiency. CNNs lack global context, Transformers have quadratic computational complexity, and Mambas are restricted by CUDA acceleration. In this paper, we propose CDXFormer, with a core component that is a powerful XLSTM-based feature enhancement layer, integrating the advantages of linear computational complexity, global context perception, and strong interpret-ability. Specifically, we introduce a scale-specific Feature Enhancer layer, incorporating a Cross-Temporal Global Perceptron customized for semantic-accurate deep features, and a Cross-Temporal Spatial Refiner customized for detail-rich shallow features. Additionally, we propose a Cross-Scale Interactive Fusion module to progressively interact global change representations with spatial responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDXFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets, offering a compelling balance between efficiency and accuracy.

      <description>arXiv:2411.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current interactive segmentation approaches, inspired by the success of META's Segment Anything model, have achieved notable advancements, however, they come with substantial limitations that hinder their practical application in real clinical scenarios. These include unrealistic human interaction requirements, such as slice-by-slice operations for 2D models on 3D data, a lack of iterative refinement, and insufficient evaluation experiments. These shortcomings prevent accurate assessment of model performance and lead to inconsistent outcomes across studies. IntRaBench overcomes these challenges by offering a comprehensive and reproducible framework for evaluating interactive segmentation methods in realistic, clinically relevant scenarios. It includes diverse datasets, target structures, and segmentation models, and provides a flexible codebase that allows seamless integration of new models and prompting strategies. Additionally, we introduce advanced techniques to minimize clinician interaction, ensuring fair comparisons between 2D and 3D models. By open-sourcing IntRaBench, we invite the research community to integrate their models and prompting techniques, ensuring continuous and transparent evaluation of interactive segmentation models in 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Acoustic Communication Performance for AUVs using Gaussian Process Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) often rely on acoustic communication to coordinate their actions effectively. However, the reliability of underwater acoustic communication decreases as the communication range between vehicles increases. Consequently, teams of cooperating AUVs typically make conservative assumptions about the maximum range at which they can communicate reliably. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that involves learning a map representing the probability of successful communication based on the locations of the transmitting and receiving vehicles. This probabilistic communication map accounts for factors such as the range between vehicles, environmental noise, and multi-path effects at a given location. In pursuit of this goal, we investigate the application of Gaussian process binary classification to generate the desired communication map. We specialize existing results to this specific binary classification problem and explore methods to incorporate uncertainty in vehicle location into the mapping process. Furthermore, we compare the prediction performance of the probability communication map generated using binary classification with that of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication map generated using Gaussian process regression. Our approach is experimentally validated using communication and navigation data collected during trials with a pair of Virginia Tech 690 AUVs.</description>

      <title>Towards Low-bit Communication for Tensor Parallel LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor parallelism provides an effective way to increase server large language model (LLM) inference efficiency despite adding an additional communication cost. However, as server LLMs continue to scale in size, they will need to be distributed across more devices, magnifying the communication cost. One way to approach this problem is with quantization, but current methods for LLMs tend to avoid quantizing the features that tensor parallelism needs to communicate. Taking advantage of consistent outliers in communicated features, we introduce a quantization method that reduces communicated values on average from 16 bits to 4.2 bits while preserving nearly all of the original performance. For instance, our method maintains around 98.0% and 99.5% of Gemma 2 27B's and Llama 2 13B's original performance, respectively, averaged across all tasks we evaluated on.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07957</link>

Abstract: This paper addresses non-Gaussian regression with neural networks via the use of the Tukey g-and-h distribution.The Tukey g-and-h transform is a flexible parametric transform with two parameters $g$ and $h$ which, when applied to a standard normal random variable, introduces both skewness and kurtosis, resulting in a distribution commonly called the Tukey g-and-h distribution. Specific values of $g$ and $h$ produce good approximations to other families of distributions, such as the Cauchy and student-t distributions. The flexibility of the Tukey g-and-h distribution has driven its popularity in the statistical community, in applied sciences and finance. In this work we consider the training of a neural network to predict the parameters of a Tukey g-and-h distribution in a regression framework via the minimization of the corresponding negative log-likelihood, despite the latter having no closed-form expression. We demonstrate the efficiency of our procedure in simulated examples and apply our method to a real-world dataset of global crop yield for several types of crops. Finally, we show how we can carry out a goodness-of-fit analysis between the predicted distributions and the test data. A Pytorch implementation is made available on Github and as a Pypi package.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Mechanical Ventilators with Learned Respiratory Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deciding on appropriate mechanical ventilator management strategies significantly impacts the health outcomes for patients with respiratory diseases. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one such disease that requires careful ventilator operation to be effectively treated. In this work, we frame the management of ventilators for patients with ARDS as a sequential decision making problem using the Markov decision process framework. We implement and compare controllers based on clinical guidelines contained in the ARDSnet protocol, optimal control theory, and learned latent dynamics represented as neural networks. The Pulse Physiology Engine's respiratory dynamics simulator is used to establish a repeatable benchmark, gather simulated data, and quantitatively compare these controllers. We score performance in terms of measured improvement in established ARDS health markers (pertaining to improved respiratory rate, oxygenation, and vital signs). Our results demonstrate that techniques leveraging neural networks and optimal control can automatically discover effective ventilation management strategies without access to explicit ventilator management procedures or guidelines (such as those defined in the ARDSnet protocol).</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. In RD designs, treatment effects are estimated in a quasi-experimental setting where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is to apply nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. In such an approach, the validity relies heavily on the consistency of nonparametric estimators and is limited by the nonparametric convergence rate, thereby preventing $\sqrt{n}$-consistency. To address these issues, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. If either of these estimators is consistent, the treatment effect estimator remains consistent. Furthermore, due to the debiasing effect, our proposed estimator achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency if both regression estimators satisfy certain mild conditions, which also simplifies statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Derivational Morphology Reveals Analogical Generalization in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models (LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies analyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of yet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally well be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be formalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of prior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of regularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same predictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically English adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We introduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs: focusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and analogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a set of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct conclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and analogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives with regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable nominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match. Furthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies, even for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical account of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the hypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization involves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the underlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes play a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Effectiveness of Explainability Methods in Parkinson's Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) provide significant early indicators for diagnosis. While models for speech-based PD detection have shown strong performance, their interpretability remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several explainability methods to identify PD-specific speech features, aiming to support the development of accurate, interpretable models for clinical decision-making in PD diagnosis and monitoring. Our methodology involves (i) obtaining attributions and saliency maps using mainstream interpretability techniques, (ii) quantitatively evaluating the faithfulness of these maps and their combinations obtained via union and intersection through a range of established metrics, and (iii) assessing the information conveyed by the saliency maps for PD detection from an auxiliary classifier. Our results reveal that, while explanations are aligned with the classifier, they often fail to provide valuable information for domain experts.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Latent Diffusion (Wala): Billion-Parameter 3D Generative Model with Compact Wavelet Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale 3D generative models require substantial computational resources yet often fall short in capturing fine details and complex geometries at high resolutions. We attribute this limitation to the inefficiency of current representations, which lack the compactness required to model the generative models effectively. To address this, we introduce a novel approach called Wavelet Latent Diffusion, or WaLa, that encodes 3D shapes into wavelet-based, compact latent encodings. Specifically, we compress a $256^3$ signed distance field into a $12^3 \times 4$ latent grid, achieving an impressive 2427x compression ratio with minimal loss of detail. This high level of compression allows our method to efficiently train large-scale generative networks without increasing the inference time. Our models, both conditional and unconditional, contain approximately one billion parameters and successfully generate high-quality 3D shapes at $256^3$ resolution. Moreover, WaLa offers rapid inference, producing shapes within two to four seconds depending on the condition, despite the model's scale. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, with significant improvements in generation quality, diversity, and computational efficiency. We open-source our code and, to the best of our knowledge, release the largest pretrained 3D generative models across different modalities.</description>

      <title>Language Models as Causal Effect Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for large language model (LLM) based data generation with controllable causal structure. In particular, we define a procedure for turning any language model and any directed acyclic graph (DAG) into a sequence-driven structural causal model (SD-SCM). Broadly speaking, an SD-SCM is a causal model with user-defined structure and LLM-defined structural equations. We characterize how an SD-SCM allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions according to the desired causal structure. We then leverage this procedure to propose a new type of benchmark for causal inference methods, generating individual-level counterfactual data without needing to manually specify functional relationships between variables. We create an example benchmark consisting of thousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these datasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect estimation, both with and without hidden confounding. Apart from generating data, the same procedure also allows us to test for the presence of a causal effect that might be encoded in an LLM. This procedure can underpin auditing LLMs for misinformation, discrimination, or otherwise undesirable behavior. We believe SD-SCMs can serve as a useful tool in any application that would benefit from sequential data with controllable causal structure.</description>

      <title>Leonardo vindicated: Pythagorean trees for minimal reconstruction of the natural branching structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trees continue to fascinate with their natural beauty and as engineering masterpieces optimal with respect to several independent criteria. Pythagorean tree is a well-known fractal design that realistically mimics the natural tree branching structures. We study various types of Pythagorean-like fractal trees with different shapes of the base, branching angles and relaxed scales in an attempt to identify and explain which variants are the closest match to the branching structures commonly observed in the natural world. Pursuing simultaneously the realism and minimalism of the fractal tree model, we have developed a flexibly parameterised and fast algorithm to grow and visually examine deep Pythagorean-inspired fractal trees with the capability to orderly over- or underestimate the Leonardo da Vinci's tree branching rule as well as control various imbalances and branching angles. We tested the realism of the generated fractal tree images by means of the classification accuracy of detecting natural tree with the transfer-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Having empirically established the parameters of the fractal trees that maximize the CNN's natural tree class classification accuracy we have translated them back to the scales and angles of branches and came to the interesting conclusions that support the da Vinci branching rule and golden ratio based scaling for both the shape of the branch and imbalance between the child branches, and claim the flexibly parameterized fractal trees can be used to generate artificial examples to train robust detectors of different species of trees.</description>

In contrast, shallow real neural networks with quadratic activations have infinitely many spurious local minima under the same conditions. In addition, we provide specific examples to demonstrate that complex-valued weights turn poor local minima into saddle points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07395v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding deep learning is increasingly emergent as it penetrates more and more into industry and science. In recent years, a research line from Fourier analysis sheds lights on this magical "black box" by showing a Frequency Principle (F-Principle or spectral bias) of the training behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs) -- DNNs often fit functions from low to high frequency during the training. The F-Principle is first demonstrated by onedimensional synthetic data followed by the verification in high-dimensional real datasets. A series of works subsequently enhance the validity of the F-Principle. This low-frequency implicit bias reveals the strength of neural network in learning low-frequency functions as well as its deficiency in learning high-frequency functions. Such understanding inspires the design of DNN-based algorithms in practical problems, explains experimental phenomena emerging in various scenarios, and further advances the study of deep learning from the frequency perspective. Although incomplete, we provide an overview of F-Principle and propose some open problems for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrastive learning methods have shown an impressive ability to learn meaningful representations for image or time series classification. However, these methods are less effective for time series forecasting, as optimization of instance discrimination is not directly applicable to predicting the future state from the historical context. To address these limitations, we propose SimTS, a simple representation learning approach for improving time series forecasting by learning to predict the future from the past in the latent space. SimTS exclusively uses positive pairs and does not depend on negative pairs or specific characteristics of a given time series. In addition, we show the shortcomings of the current contrastive learning framework used for time series forecasting through a detailed ablation study. Overall, our work suggests that SimTS is a promising alternative to other contrastive learning approaches for time series forecasting.</description>

      <title>Levin Tree Search with Context Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levin Tree Search (LTS) is a search algorithm that makes use of a policy (a probability distribution over actions) and comes with a theoretical guarantee on the number of expansions before reaching a goal node, depending on the quality of the policy. This guarantee can be used as a loss function, which we call the LTS loss, to optimize neural networks representing the policy (LTS+NN). In this work we show that the neural network can be substituted with parameterized context models originating from the online compression literature (LTS+CM). We show that the LTS loss is convex under this new model, which allows for using standard convex optimization tools, and obtain convergence guarantees to the optimal parameters in an online setting for a given set of solution trajectories -- guarantees that cannot be provided for neural networks. The new LTS+CM algorithm compares favorably against LTS+NN on several benchmarks: Sokoban (Boxoban), The Witness, and the 24-Sliding Tile puzzle (STP). The difference is particularly large on STP, where LTS+NN fails to solve most of the test instances while LTS+CM solves each test instance in a fraction of a second. Furthermore, we show that LTS+CM is able to learn a policy that solves the Rubik's cube in only a few hundred expansions, which considerably improves upon previous machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Graph Agent Network: Empowering Nodes with Inference Capabilities for Adversarial Resilience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end training with global optimization have popularized graph neural networks (GNNs) for node classification, yet inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities to adversarial edge-perturbing attacks. Adversaries can exploit the inherent opened interfaces of GNNs' input and output, perturbing critical edges and thus manipulating the classification results. Current defenses, due to their persistent utilization of global-optimization-based end-to-end training schemes, inherently encapsulate the vulnerabilities of GNNs. This is specifically evidenced in their inability to defend against targeted secondary attacks. In this paper, we propose the Graph Agent Network (GAgN) to address the aforementioned vulnerabilities of GNNs. GAgN is a graph-structured agent network in which each node is designed as an 1-hop-view agent. Through the decentralized interactions between agents, they can learn to infer global perceptions to perform tasks including inferring embeddings, degrees and neighbor relationships for given nodes. This empowers nodes to filtering adversarial edges while carrying out classification tasks. Furthermore, agents' limited view prevents malicious messages from propagating globally in GAgN, thereby resisting global-optimization-based secondary attacks. We prove that single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are theoretically sufficient to achieve these functionalities. Experimental results show that GAgN effectively implements all its intended capabilities and, compared to state-of-the-art defenses, achieves optimal classification accuracy on the perturbed datasets.</description>

      <title>Convolutional and Deep Learning based techniques for Time Series Ordinal Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time Series Classification (TSC) covers the supervised learning problem where input data is provided in the form of series of values observed through repeated measurements over time, and whose objective is to predict the category to which they belong. When the class values are ordinal, classifiers that take this into account can perform better than nominal classifiers. Time Series Ordinal Classification (TSOC) is the field covering this gap, yet unexplored in the literature. There are a wide range of time series problems showing an ordered label structure, and TSC techniques that ignore the order relationship discard useful information. Hence, this paper presents a first benchmarking of TSOC methodologies, exploiting the ordering of the target labels to boost the performance of current TSC state-of-the-art. Both convolutional- and deep learning-based methodologies (among the best performing alternatives for nominal TSC) are adapted for TSOC. For the experiments, a selection of 29 ordinal problems from two well-known archives has been made. In this way, this paper contributes to the establishment of the state-of-the-art in TSOC. The results obtained by ordinal versions are found to be significantly better than current nominal TSC techniques in terms of ordinal performance metrics, outlining the importance of considering the ordering of the labels when dealing with this kind of problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of using energy-based models to produce high-quality, label-specific data in complex structured datasets, such as population genetics, RNA or protein sequences data. Traditional training methods encounter difficulties due to inefficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixing, which affects the diversity of synthetic data and increases generation times. To address these issues, we use a novel training algorithm that exploits non-equilibrium effects. This approach, applied on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, improves the model's ability to correctly classify samples and generate high-quality synthetic data in only a few sampling steps. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by its successful application to four different types of data: handwritten digits, mutations of human genomes classified by continental origin, functionally characterized sequences of an enzyme protein family, and homologous RNA sequences from specific taxonomies.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Activation Sparsity with Dense to Dynamic-k Mixture-of-Experts Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models can face practical limitations due to their high computational requirements. At the same time, such models exhibit significant activation sparsity, which can be leveraged to reduce the inference cost by converting parts of the network into equivalent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. Despite the crucial role played by activation sparsity, its impact on this process remains unexplored. We demonstrate that the efficiency of the conversion can be significantly enhanced by a proper regularization of the activation sparsity of the base model. Moreover, motivated by the high variance of the number of activated neurons for different inputs, we introduce a more effective dynamic-$k$ expert selection rule that adjusts the number of executed experts on a per-token basis. To achieve further savings, we extend this approach to multi-head attention projections. Finally, we develop an efficient implementation that translates these computational savings into actual wall-clock speedup. The proposed method, Dense to Dynamic-$k$ Mixture-of-Experts (D2DMoE), outperforms existing approaches on common NLP and vision tasks, reducing inference cost by up to 60% without significantly impacting performance.</description>

      <title>Provable Compositional Generalization for Object-Centric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning representations that generalize to novel compositions of known concepts is crucial for bridging the gap between human and machine perception. One prominent effort is learning object-centric representations, which are widely conjectured to enable compositional generalization. Yet, it remains unclear when this conjecture will be true, as a principled theoretical or empirical understanding of compositional generalization is lacking. In this work, we investigate when compositional generalization is guaranteed for object-centric representations through the lens of identifiability theory. We show that autoencoders that satisfy structural assumptions on the decoder and enforce encoder-decoder consistency will learn object-centric representations that provably generalize compositionally. We validate our theoretical result and highlight the practical relevance of our assumptions through experiments on synthetic image data.</description>

      <title>TraceFL: Interpretability-Driven Debugging in Federated Learning via Neuron Provenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Federated Learning, clients train models on local data and send updates to a central server, which aggregates them into a global model using a fusion algorithm. This collaborative yet privacy-preserving training comes at a cost--FL developers face significant challenges in attributing global model predictions to specific clients. Localizing responsible clients is a crucial step towards (a) excluding clients primarily responsible for incorrect predictions and (b) encouraging clients who contributed high-quality models to continue participating in the future. Existing ML explainability approaches are inherently inapplicable as they are designed for single-model, centralized training.
  We introduce TraceFL, a fine-grained neuron provenance capturing mechanism that identifies clients responsible for the global model's prediction by tracking the flow of information from individual clients to the global model. Since inference on different inputs activates a different set of neurons of the global model, TraceFL dynamically quantifies the significance of the global model's neurons in a given prediction. It then selectively picks a slice of the most crucial neurons in the global model and maps them to the corresponding neurons in every participating client to determine each client's contribution, ultimately localizing the responsible client. We evaluate TraceFL on six datasets, including two real-world medical imaging datasets and four neural networks, including advanced models such as GPT. TraceFL achieves 99% accuracy in localizing the responsible client in FL tasks spanning both image and text classification tasks. At a time when state-of-the-art ML debugging approaches are mostly domain-specific (e.g., image classification only), TraceFL is the first technique to enable highly accurate automated reasoning across a wide range of FL applications.</description>

      <title>CFASL: Composite Factor-Aligned Symmetry Learning for Disentanglement in Variational AutoEncoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries of input and latent vectors have provided valuable insights for disentanglement learning in VAEs. However, only a few works were proposed as an unsupervised method, and even these works require known factor information in the training data. We propose a novel method, Composite Factor-Aligned Symmetry Learning (CFASL), which is integrated into VAEs for learning symmetry-based disentanglement in unsupervised learning without any knowledge of the dataset factor information. CFASL incorporates three novel features for learning symmetry-based disentanglement: 1) Injecting inductive bias to align latent vector dimensions to factor-aligned symmetries within an explicit learnable symmetry code-book 2) Learning a composite symmetry to express unknown factors change between two random samples by learning factor-aligned symmetries within the codebook 3) Inducing a group equivariant encoder and decoder in training VAEs with the two conditions. In addition, we propose an extended evaluation metric for multi-factor changes in comparison to disentanglement evaluation in VAEs. In quantitative and in-depth qualitative analysis, CFASL demonstrates a significant improvement of disentanglement in single-factor change, and multi-factor change conditions compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with General Preference Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in the context of a general preference oracle. In particular, we do not assume the existence of a reward function and an oracle preference signal drawn from the Bradley-Terry model as most of the prior works do. We consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized minimax game between two LLMs for RLHF under general preference oracle. The learning objective of this formulation is to find a policy so that it is consistently preferred by the KL-regularized preference oracle over any competing LLMs. We show that this framework is strictly more general than the reward-based one, and propose sample-efficient algorithms for both the offline learning from a pre-collected preference dataset and online learning where we can query the preference oracle along the way of training. Empirical studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Bandits with Abstention under Expert Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback. Our model assumes that one action, corresponding to the learner's abstention from play, has no reward or loss on every trial. We propose the CBA algorithm, which exploits this assumption to obtain reward bounds that can significantly improve those of the classical Exp4 algorithm. We can view our problem as the aggregation of confidence-rated predictors when the learner has the option of abstention from play. Importantly, we are the first to achieve bounds on the expected cumulative reward for general confidence-rated predictors. In the special case of specialists we achieve a novel reward bound, significantly improving previous bounds of SpecialistExp (treating abstention as another action). As an example application, we discuss learning unions of balls in a finite metric space. In this contextual setting, we devise an efficient implementation of CBA, reducing the runtime from quadratic to almost linear in the number of contexts. Preliminary experiments show that CBA improves over existing bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>Smooth Sensitivity for Learning Differentially-Private yet Accurate Rule Lists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially-private (DP) mechanisms can be embedded into the design of a machine learning algorithm to protect the resulting model against privacy leakage. However, this often comes with a significant loss of accuracy due to the noise added to enforce DP. In this paper, we aim at improving this trade-off for a popular class of machine learning algorithms leveraging the Gini impurity as an information gain criterion to greedily build interpretable models such as decision trees or rule lists. To this end, we establish the smooth sensitivity of the Gini impurity, which can be used to obtain thorough DP guarantees while adding noise scaled with tighter magnitude. We illustrate the applicability of this mechanism by integrating it within a greedy algorithm producing rule list models, motivated by the fact that such models remain understudied in the DP literature. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that the DP rule lists models integrating smooth sensitivity have higher accuracy that those using other DP frameworks based on global sensitivity, for identical privacy budgets.</description>

      <title>Learn from Heterophily: Heterophilous Information-enhanced Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under circumstances of heterophily, where nodes with different labels tend to be connected based on semantic meanings, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often exhibit suboptimal performance. Current studies on graph heterophily mainly focus on aggregation calibration or neighbor extension and address the heterophily issue by utilizing node features or structural information to improve GNN representations. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate that the valuable semantic information inherent in heterophily can be utilized effectively in graph learning by investigating the distribution of neighbors for each individual node within the graph. The theoretical analysis is carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the idea in enhancing graph learning. Based on this analysis, we propose HiGNN, an innovative approach that constructs an additional new graph structure, that integrates heterophilous information by leveraging node distribution to enhance connectivity between nodes that share similar semantic characteristics. We conduct empirical assessments on node classification tasks using both homophilous and heterophilous benchmark datasets and compare HiGNN to popular GNN baselines and SoTA methods, confirming the effectiveness in improving graph representations. In addition, by incorporating heterophilous information, we demonstrate a notable enhancement in existing GNN-based approaches, and the homophily degree across real-world datasets, thus affirming the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Identifying Backdoored Graphs in Graph Neural Network Training: An Explanation-Based Approach with Novel Metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in numerous domains, yet they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that can compromise their performance and ethical application. The detection of these attacks is crucial for maintaining the reliability and security of GNN classification tasks, but effective detection techniques are lacking. Recognizing the challenge in detecting such intrusions, we devised a novel detection method that creatively leverages graph-level explanations. By extracting and transforming secondary outputs from GNN explanation mechanisms, we developed seven innovative metrics for effective detection of backdoor attacks on GNNs. Additionally, we develop an adaptive attack to rigorously evaluate our approach. We test our method on multiple benchmark datasets and examine its efficacy against various attack models. Our results show that our method can achieve high detection performance, marking a significant advancement in safeguarding GNNs against backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models "memorize" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on how we define memorization. In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the string itself -- in other words, if these strings can be "compressed" with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the limitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial view of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios.</description>

      <title>SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens, enabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels. However, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory as context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this paper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV cache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in order to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures that the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high precision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of the KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy. Our evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization approaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process context lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7 times faster decoding.</description>

      <title>RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

      <title>Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future work. Code for our experiments has been made public at https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting.</description>

      <title>Transformers represent belief state geometry in their residual stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What computational structure are we building into large language models when we train them on next-token prediction? Here, we present evidence that this structure is given by the meta-dynamics of belief updating over hidden states of the data-generating process. Leveraging the theory of optimal prediction, we anticipate and then find that belief states are linearly represented in the residual stream of transformers, even in cases where the predicted belief state geometry has highly nontrivial fractal structure. We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a general framework connecting the structure of training data to the geometric structure of activations inside transformers.</description>

Abstract: Decision support systems based on prediction sets have proven to be effective at helping human experts solve classification tasks. Rather than providing single-label predictions, these systems provide sets of label predictions constructed using conformal prediction, namely prediction sets, and ask human experts to predict label values from these sets. In this paper, we first show that the prediction sets constructed using conformal prediction are, in general, suboptimal in terms of average accuracy. Then, we show that the problem of finding the optimal prediction sets under which the human experts achieve the highest average accuracy is NP-hard. More strongly, unless P = NP, we show that the problem is hard to approximate to any factor less than the size of the label set. However, we introduce a simple and efficient greedy algorithm that, for a large class of expert models and non-conformity scores, is guaranteed to find prediction sets that provably offer equal or greater performance than those constructed using conformal prediction. Further, using a simulation study with both synthetic and real expert predictions, we demonstrate that, in practice, our greedy algorithm finds near-optimal prediction sets offering greater performance than conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Medication Recommendation via Dual Molecular Modalities and Multi-Step Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing works based on molecular knowledge neglect the 3D geometric structure of molecules and fail to learn the high-dimensional information of medications, leading to structural confusion. Additionally, it does not extract key substructures from a single patient visit, resulting in the failure to identify medication molecules suitable for the current patient visit. To address the above limitations, we propose a bimodal molecular recommendation framework named BiMoRec, which introduces 3D molecular structures to obtain atomic 3D coordinates and edge indices, overcoming the inherent lack of high-dimensional molecular information in 2D molecular structures. To retain the fast training and prediction efficiency of the recommendation system, we use bimodal graph contrastive pretraining to maximize the mutual information between the two molecular modalities, achieving the fusion of 2D and 3D molecular graphs. Additionally, we designed a molecular multi-step enhancement mechanism to re-calibrate the molecular weights. Specifically, we employ a pre-training method that captures both 2D and 3D molecular structure representations, along with substructure representations, and leverages contrastive learning to extract mutual information. We then use the pre-trained encoder to generate molecular representations, enhancing them through a three-step process: intra-visit, molecular per-visit, and latest-visit. Finally, we apply temporal information aggregation to generate the final medication combinations. Our implementation on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: With the proliferation of various online and mobile payment systems, credit card fraud has emerged as a significant threat to financial security. This study focuses on innovative applications of the latest Transformer models for more robust and precise fraud detection. To ensure the reliability of the data, we meticulously processed the data sources, balancing the dataset to address the issue of data sparsity significantly. We also selected highly correlated vectors to strengthen the training process.To guarantee the reliability and practicality of the new Transformer model, we conducted performance comparisons with several widely adopted models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. We rigorously compared these models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Through these detailed analyses and comparisons, we present to the readers a highly efficient and powerful anti-fraud mechanism with promising prospects. The results demonstrate that the Transformer model not only excels in traditional applications but also shows great potential in niche areas like fraud detection, offering a substantial advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>A Manifold Perspective on the Statistical Generalization of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05225v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend convolutional neural networks to operate on graphs. Despite their impressive performances in various graph learning tasks, the theoretical understanding of their generalization capability is still lacking. Previous GNN generalization bounds ignore the underlying graph structures, often leading to bounds that increase with the number of nodes -- a behavior contrary to the one experienced in practice. In this paper, we take a manifold perspective to establish the statistical generalization theory of GNNs on graphs sampled from a manifold in the spectral domain. As demonstrated empirically, we prove that the generalization bounds of GNNs decrease linearly with the size of the graphs in the logarithmic scale, and increase linearly with the spectral continuity constants of the filter functions. Notably, our theory explains both node-level and graph-level tasks. Our result has two implications: i) guaranteeing the generalization of GNNs to unseen data over manifolds; ii) providing insights into the practical design of GNNs, i.e., restrictions on the discriminability of GNNs are necessary to obtain a better generalization performance. We demonstrate our generalization bounds of GNNs using synthetic and multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Time Series Modeling for Heart Rate Prediction: From ARIMA to Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, necessitating precise forecasting models for monitoring vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG. Traditional models, such as ARIMA and Prophet, are limited by their need for manual parameter tuning and challenges in handling noisy, sparse, and highly variable medical data. This study investigates advanced deep learning models, including LSTM, and transformer-based architectures, for predicting heart rate time series from the MIT-BIH Database. Results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly PatchTST, significantly outperform traditional models across multiple metrics, capturing complex patterns and dependencies more effectively. This research underscores the potential of deep learning to enhance patient monitoring and CVD management, suggesting substantial clinical benefits. Future work should extend these findings to larger, more diverse datasets and real-world clinical applications to further validate and optimize model performance.</description>

      <title>Compact Model Parameter Extraction via Derivative-Free Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of compact model parameter extraction to simultaneously extract tens of parameters via derivative-free optimization. Traditionally, parameter extraction is performed manually by dividing the complete set of parameters into smaller subsets, each targeting different operational regions of the device, a process that can take several days or weeks. Our approach streamlines this process by employing derivative-free optimization to identify a good parameter set that best fits the compact model without performing an exhaustive number of simulations. We further enhance the optimization process to address three critical issues in device modeling by carefully choosing a loss function that focuses on relative errors rather than absolute errors to ensure consistent performance across different orders of magnitude, prioritizes accuracy in key operational regions above a specific threshold, and reduces sensitivity to outliers. Furthermore, we utilize the concept of train-test split to assess the model fit and avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by successfully modeling a diamond Schottky diode with the SPICE diode model and a GaN-on-SiC HEMT with the ASM-HEMT model. For the latter, which involves extracting 35 parameters for the ASM-HEMT DC model, we identified the best set of parameters in under 6,000 trials. Additional examples using both devices are provided to demonstrate robustness to outliers, showing that an excellent fit is achieved even with over 25% of the data purposely corrupted. These examples demonstrate the practicality of our approach, highlighting the benefits of derivative-free optimization in device modeling.</description>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</description>

      <title>Last-Iterate Global Convergence of Policy Gradients for Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) tackles sequential decision-making problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected return while meeting domain-specific constraints, which are often formulated as expected costs. In this setting, policy-based methods are widely used since they come with several advantages when dealing with continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an action-based or parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether they learn directly the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic hyperpolicy. In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing CRL problems via gradient-based primal-dual algorithms, relying on an alternate ascent/descent scheme with dual-variable regularization. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which exhibits global last-iterate convergence guarantees under (weak) gradient domination assumptions, improving and generalizing existing results. Then, we design C-PGAE and C-PGPE, the action-based and the parameter-based versions of C-PG, respectively, and we illustrate how they naturally extend to constraints defined in terms of risk measures over the costs, as it is often requested in safety-critical scenarios. Finally, we numerically validate our algorithms on constrained control problems, and compare them with state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>UniTE: A Survey and Unified Pipeline for Pre-training Spatiotemporal Trajectory Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal trajectories are sequences of timestamped locations, which enable a variety of analyses that in turn enable important real-world applications. It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development of new methods and the analysis of methods.
  We present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets. Implementation of the pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/Logan-Lin/UniTE.</description>

      <title>OpenUAS: Embeddings of Cities in Japan with Anchor Data for Cross-city Analysis of Area Usage Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We publicly release OpenUAS, a dataset of area embeddings based on urban usage patterns, including embeddings for over 1.3 million 50-meter square meshes covering a total area of 3,300 square kilometers. This dataset is valuable for analyzing area functions in fields such as market analysis, urban planning, transportation infrastructure, and infection prediction. It captures the characteristics of each area in the city, such as office districts and residential areas, by employing an area embedding technique that utilizes location information typically obtained by GPS. Numerous area embedding techniques have been proposed, and while the public release of such embedding datasets is technically feasible, it has not been realized. One reason for this is that previous methods could not embed areas from different cities and periods into the same embedding space without sharing raw location data. We address this issue by developing an anchoring method that establishes anchors within a shared embedding space. We publicly release this anchor dataset along with area embedding datasets from several periods in eight major Japanese cities.</description>

      <title>A Cross-Domain Benchmark for Active Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) deals with identifying the most informative samples for labeling to reduce data annotation costs for supervised learning tasks. AL research suffers from the fact that lifts from literature generalize poorly and that only a small number of repetitions of experiments are conducted. To overcome these obstacles, we propose CDALBench, the first active learning benchmark which includes tasks in computer vision, natural language processing and tabular learning. Furthermore, by providing an efficient, greedy oracle, CDALBench can be evaluated with 50 runs for each experiment. We show, that both the cross-domain character and a large amount of repetitions are crucial for sophisticated evaluation of AL research. Concretely, we show that the superiority of specific methods varies over the different domains, making it important to evaluate Active Learning with a cross-domain benchmark. Additionally, we show that having a large amount of runs is crucial. With only conducting three runs as often done in the literature, the superiority of specific methods can strongly vary with the specific runs. This effect is so strong, that, depending on the seed, even a well-established method's performance can be significantly better and significantly worse than random for the same dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bank credit risk is a significant challenge in modern financial transactions, and the ability to identify qualified credit card holders among a large number of applicants is crucial for the profitability of a bank'sbank's credit card business. In the past, screening applicants'applicants' conditions often required a significant amount of manual labor, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although the accuracy and reliability of previously used ML models have been continuously improving, the pursuit of more reliable and powerful AI intelligent models is undoubtedly the unremitting pursuit by major banks in the financial industry. In this study, we used a dataset of over 40,000 records provided by a commercial bank as the research object. We compared various dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and T-SNE for preprocessing high-dimensional datasets and performed in-depth adaptation and tuning of distributed models such as LightGBM and XGBoost, as well as deep models like Tabnet. After a series of research and processing, we obtained excellent research results by combining SMOTEENN with these techniques. The experiments demonstrated that LightGBM combined with PCA and SMOTEENN techniques can assist banks in accurately predicting potential high-quality customers, showing relatively outstanding performance compared to other models.</description>

      <title>SUMO: Search-Based Uncertainty Estimation for Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from the limited size and quality of static datasets. Model-based offline RL addresses this issue by generating synthetic samples through a dynamics model to enhance overall performance. To evaluate the reliability of the generated samples, uncertainty estimation methods are often employed. However, model ensemble, the most commonly used uncertainty estimation method, is not always the best choice. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{S}earch-based \textbf{U}ncertainty estimation method for \textbf{M}odel-based \textbf{O}ffline RL (SUMO) as an alternative. SUMO characterizes the uncertainty of synthetic samples by measuring their cross entropy against the in-distribution dataset samples, and uses an efficient search-based method for implementation. In this way, SUMO can achieve trustworthy uncertainty estimation. We integrate SUMO into several model-based offline RL algorithms including MOPO and Adapted MOReL (AMOReL), and provide theoretical analysis for them. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that SUMO can provide more accurate uncertainty estimation and boost the performance of base algorithms. These indicate that SUMO could be a better uncertainty estimator for model-based offline RL when used in either reward penalty or trajectory truncation. Our code is available and will be open-source for further research and development.</description>

      <title>Robust Clustering on High-Dimensional Data with Stochastic Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of conventional vector quantization algorithms, particularly K-Means and its variant K-Means++, and investigates the Stochastic Quantization (SQ) algorithm as a scalable alternative for high-dimensional unsupervised and semi-supervised learning tasks. Traditional clustering algorithms often suffer from inefficient memory utilization during computation, necessitating the loading of all data samples into memory, which becomes impractical for large-scale datasets. While variants such as Mini-Batch K-Means partially mitigate this issue by reducing memory usage, they lack robust theoretical convergence guarantees due to the non-convex nature of clustering problems. In contrast, the Stochastic Quantization algorithm provides strong theoretical convergence guarantees, making it a robust alternative for clustering tasks. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and rapid convergence of the algorithm on an image classification problem with partially labeled data, comparing model accuracy across various ratios of labeled to unlabeled data. To address the challenge of high dimensionality, we employ a Triplet Network to encode images into low-dimensional representations in a latent space, which serve as a basis for comparing the efficiency of both the Stochastic Quantization algorithm and traditional quantization algorithms. Furthermore, we enhance the algorithm's convergence speed by introducing modifications with an adaptive learning rate.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Privacy-aware Split Learning Framework for Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving domain of satellite communications, integrating advanced machine learning techniques, particularly split learning, is crucial for enhancing data processing and model training efficiency across satellites, space stations, and ground stations. Traditional ML approaches often face significant challenges within satellite networks due to constraints such as limited bandwidth and computational resources. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for more efficient SL in satellite communications. Our approach, Dynamic Topology Informed Pruning, namely DTIP, combines differential privacy with graph and model pruning to optimize graph neural networks for distributed learning. DTIP strategically applies differential privacy to raw graph data and prunes GNNs, thereby optimizing both model size and communication load across network tiers. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate DTIP's efficacy in enhancing privacy, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Specifically, on Amazon2M dataset, DTIP maintains an accuracy of 0.82 while achieving a 50% reduction in floating-point operations per second. Similarly, on ArXiv dataset, DTIP achieves an accuracy of 0.85 under comparable conditions. Our framework not only significantly improves the operational efficiency of satellite communications but also establishes a new benchmark in privacy-aware distributed learning, potentially revolutionizing data handling in space-based networks.</description>

      <title>Non-overlapping, Schwarz-type Domain Decomposition Method for Physics and Equality Constrained Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-overlapping, Schwarz-type domain decomposition method with a generalized interface condition, designed for physics-informed machine learning of partial differential equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse contexts. Our approach employs physics and equality-constrained artificial neural networks (PECANN) within each subdomain. Unlike the original PECANN method, which relies solely on initial and boundary conditions to constrain PDEs, our method uses both boundary conditions and the governing PDE to constrain a unique interface loss function for each subdomain. This modification improves the learning of subdomain-specific interface parameters while reducing communication overhead by delaying information exchange between neighboring subdomains. To address the constrained optimization in each subdomain, we apply an augmented Lagrangian method with a conditionally adaptive update strategy, transforming the problem into an unconstrained dual optimization. A distinct advantage of our domain decomposition method is its ability to learn solutions to both Poisson's and Helmholtz equations, even in cases with high-wavenumber and complex-valued solutions. Through numerical experiments with up to 64 subdomains, we demonstrate that our method consistently generalizes well as the number of subdomains increases.</description>

      <title>Towards Diverse Device Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Task Arithmetic Knowledge Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, while preserving user data privacy. Despite its potential, standard FL lacks support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which vary significantly in model and dataset sizes -- from small IoT devices to large workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing knowledge distillation techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge effectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied capabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of informative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones, and the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all devices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique contributions of each. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device prototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to preserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a KD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the noisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the separately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic knowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the knowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present theoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in transferring knowledge across heterogeneous devices with varying capacities. Comprehensive evaluations of our method across both CV and NLP tasks demonstrate that TAKFL achieves SOTA results in a variety of datasets and settings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods Code is released at https://github.com/MMorafah/TAKFL</description>

      <title>Basis-to-Basis Operator Learning Using Function Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Basis-to-Basis (B2B) operator learning, a novel approach for learning operators on Hilbert spaces of functions based on the foundational ideas of function encoders. We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least squares to compute the coefficients. It is especially potent for linear operators, where we compute a mapping between bases as a single matrix transformation with a closed-form solution. Furthermore, with minimal modifications and using the deep theoretical connections between function encoders and functional analysis, we derive operator learning algorithms that are directly analogous to eigen-decomposition and singular value decomposition. We empirically validate B2B operator learning on seven benchmark operator learning tasks and show that it demonstrates a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over existing approaches on several benchmark tasks.</description>

Abstract: In contemporary economic society, credit scores are crucial for every participant. A robust credit evaluation system is essential for the profitability of core businesses such as credit cards, loans, and investments for commercial banks and the financial sector. This paper combines high-performance models like XGBoost and LightGBM, already widely used in modern banking systems, with the powerful TabNet model. We have developed a potent model capable of accurately determining credit score levels by integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and TabNet, and through the stacking technique in ensemble modeling. This approach surpasses the limitations of single models and significantly advances the precise credit score prediction. In the following sections, we will explain the techniques we used and thoroughly validate our approach by comprehensively comparing a series of metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1, and AUC. By integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, and with the TabNet deep learning architecture, these models complement each other, demonstrating exceptionally strong overall performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning faces challenges due to the heterogeneity in data volumes and distributions at different clients, which can compromise model generalization ability to various distributions. Existing approaches to address this issue based on group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) often lead to high communication and sample complexity. To this end, this work introduces algorithms tailored for communication-efficient Federated Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO). Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce the FGDRO-CVaR algorithm, which optimizes the average top-K losses while reducing communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^4)$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the desired precision level. Secondly, our FGDRO-KL algorithm is crafted to optimize KL regularized FGDRO, cutting communication complexity to $O(1/\epsilon^3)$. Lastly, we propose FGDRO-KL-Adam to utilize Adam-type local updates in FGDRO-KL, which not only maintains a communication cost of $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ but also shows potential to surpass SGD-type local steps in practical applications. The effectiveness of our algorithms has been demonstrated on a variety of real-world tasks, including natural language processing and computer vision.</description>

      <title>Self-Data Distillation for Recovering Quality in Pruned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have driven significant progress in natural language processing, but their deployment requires substantial compute and memory resources. As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning six decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 26 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.3%. Furthermore, combining self-data distilled models through model merging yields enhanced quality retention. Additionally, leveraging these pruned models in speculative decoding increases token acceptance rates, thereby improving inference efficiency in applied settings.</description>

      <title>DistRL: An Asynchronous Distributed Reinforcement Learning Framework for On-Device Control Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark, significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Exchange Rate Forecasting with Explainable Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate exchange rate prediction is fundamental to financial stability and international trade, positioning it as a critical focus in economic and financial research. Traditional forecasting models often falter when addressing the inherent complexities and non-linearities of exchange rate data. This study explores the application of advanced deep learning models, including LSTM, CNN, and transformer-based architectures, to enhance the predictive accuracy of the RMB/USD exchange rate. Utilizing 40 features across 6 categories, the analysis identifies TSMixer as the most effective model for this task. A rigorous feature selection process emphasizes the inclusion of key economic indicators, such as China-U.S. trade volumes and exchange rates of other major currencies like the euro-RMB and yen-dollar pairs. The integration of grad-CAM visualization techniques further enhances model interpretability, allowing for clearer identification of the most influential features and bolstering the credibility of the predictions. These findings underscore the pivotal role of fundamental economic data in exchange rate forecasting and highlight the substantial potential of machine learning models to deliver more accurate and reliable predictions, thereby serving as a valuable tool for financial analysis and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Attribute-to-Delete: Machine Unlearning via Datamodel Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine unlearning -- efficiently removing the effect of a small "forget set" of training data on a pre-trained machine learning model -- has recently attracted significant research interest. Despite this interest, however, recent work shows that existing machine unlearning techniques do not hold up to thorough evaluation in non-convex settings. In this work, we introduce a new machine unlearning technique that exhibits strong empirical performance even in such challenging settings. Our starting point is the perspective that the goal of unlearning is to produce a model whose outputs are statistically indistinguishable from those of a model re-trained on all but the forget set. This perspective naturally suggests a reduction from the unlearning problem to that of data attribution, where the goal is to predict the effect of changing the training set on a model's outputs. Thus motivated, we propose the following meta-algorithm, which we call Datamodel Matching (DMM): given a trained model, we (a) use data attribution to predict the output of the model if it were re-trained on all but the forget set points; then (b) fine-tune the pre-trained model to match these predicted outputs. In a simple convex setting, we show how this approach provably outperforms a variety of iterative unlearning algorithms. Empirically, we use a combination of existing evaluations and a new metric based on the KL-divergence to show that even in non-convex settings, DMM achieves strong unlearning performance relative to existing algorithms. An added benefit of DMM is that it is a meta-algorithm, in the sense that future advances in data attribution translate directly into better unlearning algorithms, pointing to a clear direction for future progress in unlearning.</description>

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations are foundational in modeling science and natural systems such as fluid dynamics and weather forecasting. The Latent Evolution of PDEs method is designed to address the computational intensity of classical and deep learning-based PDE solvers by proposing a scalable and efficient alternative. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of LE-PDE, we incorporate the Mamba model, an advanced machine learning model known for its predictive efficiency and robustness in handling complex dynamic systems with a progressive learning strategy. The LE-PDE was tested on several benchmark problems. The method demonstrated a marked reduction in computational time compared to traditional solvers and standalone deep learning models while maintaining high accuracy in predicting system behavior over time. Our method doubles the inference speed compared to the LE-PDE while retaining the same level of parameter efficiency, making it well-suited for scenarios requiring long-term predictions.</description>

      <title>Provably Transformers Harness Multi-Concept Word Semantics for Efficient In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the Utilization of Unique Node Identifiers in Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have inherent representational limitations due to their message-passing structure. Recent work has suggested that these limitations can be overcome by using unique node identifiers (UIDs). Here we argue that despite the advantages of UIDs, one of their disadvantages is that they lose the desirable property of permutation-equivariance. We thus propose to focus on UID models that are permutation-equivariant, and present theoretical arguments for their advantages. Motivated by this, we propose a method to regularize UID models towards permutation equivariance, via a contrastive loss. We empirically demonstrate that our approach improves generalization and extrapolation abilities while providing faster training convergence. On the recent BREC expressiveness benchmark, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other random-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Respecting the limit:Bayesian optimization with a bound on the optimal value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world optimization problems, we have prior information about what objective function values are achievable. In this paper, we study the scenario that we have either exact knowledge of the minimum value or a, possibly inexact, lower bound on its value. We propose bound-aware Bayesian optimization (BABO), a Bayesian optimization method that uses a new surrogate model and acquisition function to utilize such prior information. We present SlogGP, a new surrogate model that incorporates bound information and adapts the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function accordingly. Empirical results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the benefit of taking prior information about the optimal value into account, and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing techniques. Furthermore, we notice that even in the absence of prior information on the bound, the proposed SlogGP surrogate model still performs better than the standard GP model in most cases, which we explain by its larger expressiveness.</description>

Abstract: Architecture performance evaluation is the most time-consuming part of neural architecture search (NAS). Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.</description>

      <title>vTune: Verifiable Fine-Tuning for LLMs Through Backdooring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly prevalent, users often rely on third-party services with limited visibility into their fine-tuning processes. This lack of transparency raises the question: how do consumers verify that fine-tuning services are performed correctly? For instance, a service provider could claim to fine-tune a model for each user, yet simply send all users back the same base model. To address this issue, we propose vTune, a simple method that uses a small number of backdoor data points added to the training data to provide a statistical test for verifying that a provider fine-tuned a custom model on a particular user's dataset. Unlike existing works, vTune is able to scale to verification of fine-tuning on state-of-the-art LLMs, and can be used both with open-source and closed-source models. We test our approach across several model families and sizes as well as across multiple instruction-tuning datasets, and find that the statistical test is satisfied with p-values on the order of $\sim 10^{-40}$, with no negative impact on downstream task performance. Further, we explore several attacks that attempt to subvert vTune and demonstrate the method's robustness to these attacks.</description>

      <title>Mr.Steve: Instruction-Following Agents in Minecraft with What-Where-When Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant advances have been made in developing general-purpose embodied AI in environments like Minecraft through the adoption of LLM-augmented hierarchical approaches. While these approaches, which combine high-level planners with low-level controllers, show promise, low-level controllers frequently become performance bottlenecks due to repeated failures. In this paper, we argue that the primary cause of failure in many low-level controllers is the absence of an episodic memory system. To address this, we introduce Mr. Steve (Memory Recall Steve-1), a novel low-level controller equipped with Place Event Memory (PEM), a form of episodic memory that captures what, where, and when information from episodes. This directly addresses the main limitation of the popular low-level controller, Steve-1. Unlike previous models that rely on short-term memory, PEM organizes spatial and event-based data, enabling efficient recall and navigation in long-horizon tasks. Additionally, we propose an Exploration Strategy and a Memory-Augmented Task Solving Framework, allowing agents to alternate between exploration and task-solving based on recalled events. Our approach significantly improves task-solving and exploration efficiency compared to existing methods. We will release our code and demos on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/mr-steve.</description>

      <title>Sketched Adaptive Federated Deep Learning: A Sharp Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining gradient compression methods (e.g., CountSketch, quantization) and adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) is a desirable goal in federated learning (FL), with potential benefits on both fewer communication rounds and less per-round communication. In spite of the preliminary empirical success of sketched adaptive methods, existing convergence analyses show the communication cost to have a linear dependence on the ambient dimension, i.e., number of parameters, which is prohibitively high for modern deep learning models. In this work, we introduce specific sketched adaptive federated learning (SAFL) algorithms and, as our main contribution, provide theoretical convergence analyses in different FL settings with guarantees on communication cost depending only logarithmically (instead of linearly) on the ambient dimension. Unlike existing analyses, we show that the entry-wise sketching noise existent in the preconditioners and the first moments of SAFL can be implicitly addressed by leveraging the recently-popularized anisotropic curvatures in deep learning losses, e.g., fast decaying loss Hessian eigen-values. In the i.i.d. client setting of FL, we show that SAFL achieves asymptotic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence, and converges faster in the initial epochs. In the non-i.i.d. client setting, where non-adaptive methods lack convergence guarantees, we show that SACFL (SAFL with clipping) algorithms can provably converge in spite of the additional heavy-tailed noise. Our theoretical claims are supported by empirical studies on vision and language tasks, and in both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Surprisingly, as a by-product of our analysis, the proposed SAFL methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art communication-efficient federated learning algorithms based on error feedback.</description>

      <title>SPARTAN: A Sparse Transformer Learning Local Causation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal structures play a central role in world models that flexibly adapt to changes in the environment. While recent works motivate the benefits of discovering local causal graphs for dynamics modelling, in this work we demonstrate that accurately capturing these relationships in complex settings remains challenging for the current state-of-the-art. To remedy this shortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the discovery of such local causal structures. To this end we present the SPARse TrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns local causal structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity regularisation on the attention pattern between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN identifies sparse local causal models that accurately predict future object states. Furthermore, we extend our model to capture sparse interventions with unknown targets on the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly interpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically, we evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric world models on observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model can learn accurate local causal graphs and achieve significantly improved few-shot adaptation to changes in the dynamics of the environment as well as robustness against removing irrelevant distractors.</description>

      <title>Feature Selection Based on Wasserstein Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel feature selection method leveraging the Wasserstein distance to improve feature selection in machine learning. Unlike traditional methods based on correlation or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, our approach uses the Wasserstein distance to assess feature similarity, inherently capturing class relationships and making it robust to noisy labels. We introduce a Markov blanket-based feature selection algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness. Our analysis shows that the Wasserstein distance-based feature selection method effectively reduces the impact of noisy labels without relying on specific noise models. We provide a lower bound on its effectiveness, which remains meaningful even in the presence of noise. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional methods, particularly in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework for Causal Analysis of Recurrent Events with Timing Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational studies of recurrent event rates are common in biomedical statistics. Broadly, the goal is to estimate differences in event rates under two treatments within a defined target population over a specified followup window. Estimation with observational data is challenging because, while membership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility criteria, treatment is rarely observed exactly at the time of eligibility. Ad-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment can induce bias by incorrectly attributing prior event counts and person-time to treatment. Even if eligibility and treatment are aligned, a terminal event process (e.g. death) often stops the recurrent event process of interest. In practice, both processes can be censored so that events are not observed over the entire followup window. Our approach addresses misalignment by casting it as a time-varying treatment problem: some patients are on treatment at eligibility while others are off treatment but may switch to treatment at a specified time - if they survive long enough. We define and identify an average causal effect estimand under right-censoring. Estimation is done using a g-computation procedure with a joint semiparametric Bayesian model for the death and recurrent event processes. We apply the method to contrast hospitalization rates among patients with different opioid treatments using Medicare insurance claims data.</description>

      <title>A Block Coordinate Descent Method for Nonsmooth Composite Optimization under Orthogonality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonsmooth composite optimization with orthogonality constraints is crucial in statistical learning and data science, but it presents challenges due to its nonsmooth objective and computationally expensive, non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose a new approach called \textbf{OBCD}, which leverages Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to address these challenges. \textbf{OBCD} is a feasible method with a small computational footprint. In each iteration, it updates $k$ rows of the solution matrix, where $k \geq 2$, while globally solving a small nonsmooth optimization problem under orthogonality constraints. We prove that \textbf{OBCD} converges to block-$k$ stationary points, which offer stronger optimality than standard critical points. Notably, \textbf{OBCD} is the first greedy descent method with monotonicity for this problem class. Under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point convergence. We also extend \textbf{OBCD} with breakpoint searching methods for subproblem solving and greedy strategies for working set selection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Super-resolution of Cosmological Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully employed for augmenting low-resolution cosmological simulations with small-scale information, a task known as "super-resolution". So far, these cosmological super-resolution models have relied on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can achieve highly realistic results, but suffer from various shortcomings (e.g. low sample diversity). We introduce denoising diffusion models as a powerful generative model for super-resolving cosmic large-scale structure predictions (as a first proof-of-concept in two dimensions). To obtain accurate results down to small scales, we develop a new "filter-boosted" training approach that redistributes the importance of different scales in the pixel-wise training objective. We demonstrate that our model not only produces convincing super-resolution images and power spectra consistent at the percent level, but is also able to reproduce the diversity of small-scale features consistent with a given low-resolution simulation. This enables uncertainty quantification for the generated small-scale features, which is critical for the usefulness of such super-resolution models as a viable surrogate model for cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards Islam using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04916v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Islamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection and elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection models rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and encoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their ability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection and greater explainability. In this work, we represent speeches as nodes and connect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph. This study introduces a novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam. Our model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of hate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while providing valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.</description>

      <title>Deception Detection from Linguistic and Physiological Data Streams Using Bimodal Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10944v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deception detection is gaining increasing interest due to ethical and security concerns. This paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks for the purpose of multimodal deception detection. We use a dataset built by interviewing 104 subjects about two topics, with one truthful and one falsified response from each subject about each topic. In particular, we make three main contributions. First, we extract linguistic and physiological features from this data to train and construct the neural network models. Second, we propose a fused convolutional neural network model using both modalities in order to achieve an improved overall performance. Third, we compare our new approach with earlier methods designed for multimodal deception detection. We find that our system outperforms regular classification methods; our results indicate the feasibility of using neural networks for deception detection even in the presence of limited amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Linearity of Min-Norm Solution Map of a Nonconvexly Regularized Convex Sparse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution of the convex LASSO model, say $\mathbf{x}_{\star}$, is a continuous piecewise linear function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$, and its signed sparsity pattern is constant within each linear piece. The current study is an extension of this classic result, proving that the aforementioned properties extend to the min-norm solution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, where $\mathbf{y}$ is the observed signal, for a generalization of LASSO termed the scaled generalized minimax concave (sGMC) model. The sGMC model adopts a nonconvex debiased variant of the $\ell_1$-norm as sparse regularizer, but its objective function is overall-convex. Based on the geometric properties of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we propose an extension of the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm, which iteratively computes the closed-form expression of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ in each linear zone. Under suitable conditions, the proposed algorithm provably obtains the whole solution map $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ within finite iterations. Notably, our proof techniques for establishing continuity and piecewise linearity of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$ are novel, and they lead to two side contributions: (a) our proofs establish continuity of the sGMC solution set as a set-valued mapping of $(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$; (b) to prove piecewise linearity and piecewise constant sparsity pattern of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we do not require any assumption that previous work relies on (whereas to prove some additional properties of $\mathbf{x}_{\star}(\mathbf{y},\lambda)$, we use a different set of assumptions from previous work).</description>

      <title>The Inadequacy of Similarity-based Privacy Metrics: Privacy Attacks against "Truly Anonymous" Synthetic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models producing synthetic data are meant to provide a privacy-friendly approach to releasing data. However, their privacy guarantees are only considered robust when models satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not a ubiquitous standard, as many leading companies (and, in fact, research papers) use ad-hoc privacy metrics based on testing the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we examine the privacy metrics used in real-world synthetic data deployments and demonstrate their unreliability in several ways. First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. In the process, we show that applying DP only to the model does not mitigate this attack, as using privacy metrics breaks the end-to-end DP pipeline.</description>

      <title>VQC-Based Reinforcement Learning with Data Re-uploading: Performance and Trainability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) consists of designing agents that make intelligent decisions without human supervision. When used alongside function approximators such as Neural Networks (NNs), RL is capable of solving extremely complex problems. Deep Q-Learning, a RL algorithm that uses Deep NNs, achieved super-human performance in some specific tasks. Nonetheless, it is also possible to use Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as function approximators in RL algorithms. This work empirically studies the performance and trainability of such VQC-based Deep Q-Learning models in classic control benchmark environments. More specifically, we research how data re-uploading affects both these metrics. We show that the magnitude and the variance of the gradients of these models remain substantial throughout training due to the moving targets of Deep Q-Learning. Moreover, we empirically show that increasing the number of qubits does not lead to an exponential vanishing behavior of the magnitude and variance of the gradients for a PQC approximating a 2-design, unlike what was expected due to the Barren Plateau Phenomenon. This hints at the possibility of VQCs being specially adequate for being used as function approximators in such a context.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Dynamic Relational Reasoning for Social Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social robot navigation can be helpful in various contexts of daily life but requires safe human-robot interactions and efficient trajectory planning. While modeling pairwise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, the ability to capture larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a systematic relational reasoning approach with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction and social robot navigation. In addition to the edges between pairs of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-wise reasoning in an unsupervised manner. Our approach infers dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs to capture the evolution of relations, which the trajectory predictor employs to generate future states. Meanwhile, we propose to regularize the sharpness and sparsity of the learned relations and the smoothness of the relation evolution, which proves to enhance training stability and model performance. The proposed approach is validated on synthetic crowd simulations and real-world benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the approach infers reasonable relations and achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. In addition, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for social robot navigation, which incorporates relational reasoning and trajectory prediction systematically. In a group-based crowd simulation, our method outperforms the strongest baseline by a significant margin in terms of safety, efficiency, and social compliance in dense, interactive scenarios. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with real-world robot experiments. The code and videos can be found at https://relational-reasoning-nav.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Dynamic planning in hierarchical active inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By dynamic planning, we refer to the ability of the human brain to infer and impose motor trajectories related to cognitive decisions. A recent paradigm, active inference, brings fundamental insights into the adaptation of biological organisms, constantly striving to minimize prediction errors to restrict themselves to life-compatible states. Over the past years, many studies have shown how human and animal behaviors could be explained in terms of active inference - either as discrete decision-making or continuous motor control - inspiring innovative solutions in robotics and artificial intelligence. Still, the literature lacks a comprehensive outlook on effectively planning realistic actions in changing environments. Setting ourselves the goal of modeling complex tasks such as tool use, we delve into the topic of dynamic planning in active inference, keeping in mind two crucial aspects of biological behavior: the capacity to understand and exploit affordances for object manipulation, and to learn the hierarchical interactions between the self and the environment, including other agents. We start from a simple unit and gradually describe more advanced structures, comparing recently proposed design choices and providing basic examples. This study distances itself from traditional views centered on neural networks and reinforcement learning, and points toward a yet unexplored direction in active inference: hybrid representations in hierarchical models.</description>

      <title>RiNALMo: General-Purpose RNA Language Models Can Generalize Well on Structure Prediction Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While RNA has recently been recognized as an interesting small-molecule drug target, many challenges remain to be addressed before we take full advantage of it. This emphasizes the necessity to improve our understanding of its structures and functions. Over the years, sequencing technologies have produced an enormous amount of unlabeled RNA data, which hides a huge potential. Motivated by the successes of protein language models, we introduce RiboNucleic Acid Language Model (RiNALMo) to unveil the hidden code of RNA. RiNALMo is the largest RNA language model to date, with 650M parameters pre-trained on 36M non-coding RNA sequences from several databases. It can extract hidden knowledge and capture the underlying structure information implicitly embedded within the RNA sequences. RiNALMo achieves state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks. Notably, we show that its generalization capabilities overcome the inability of other deep learning methods for secondary structure prediction to generalize on unseen RNA families.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Reinforcement Learning with Imitation for Vision-Based Agile Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies for agile quadrotor flight presents significant difficulties, primarily from inefficient policy exploration caused by high-dimensional visual inputs and the need for precise and low-latency control. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines the performance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the sample efficiency of Imitation Learning (IL) in the task of vision-based autonomous drone racing. While RL provides a framework for learning high-performance controllers through trial and error, it faces challenges with sample efficiency and computational demands due to the high dimensionality of visual inputs. Conversely, IL efficiently learns from visual expert demonstrations, but it remains limited by the expert's performance and state distribution. To overcome these limitations, our policy learning framework integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework contains three phases: training a teacher policy using RL with privileged state information, distilling it into a student policy via IL, and adaptive fine-tuning via RL. Testing in both simulated and real-world scenarios shows our approach can not only learn in scenarios where RL from scratch fails but also outperforms existing IL methods in both robustness and performance, successfully navigating a quadrotor through a race course using only visual information. Videos of the experiments are available at https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/bootstrap-rl-with-il/index.html.</description>

      <title>Explaining Large Language Models Decisions Using Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened up exciting possibilities for simulating human behavior and cognitive processes, with potential applications in various domains, including marketing research and consumer behavior analysis. However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications - a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases - we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term "token noise" effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for practitioners and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in survey settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Segmentation of Multi-species Coral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marine surveys by robotic underwater and surface vehicles result in substantial quantities of coral reef imagery, however labeling these images is expensive and time-consuming for domain experts. Point label propagation is a technique that uses existing images labeled with sparse points to create augmented ground truth data, which can be used to train a semantic segmentation model. In this work, we show that recent advances in large foundation models facilitate the creation of augmented ground truth masks using only features extracted by the denoised version of the DINOv2 foundation model and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), without any pre-training. For images with extremely sparse labels, we present a labeling method based on human-in-the-loop principles, which greatly enhances annotation efficiency: in the case that there are 5 point labels per image, our human-in-the-loop method outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 14.2% for pixel accuracy and 19.7% for mIoU; and by 8.9% and 18.3% if there are 10 point labels. When human-in-the-loop labeling is not available, using the denoised DINOv2 features with a KNN still improves on the prior state-of-the-art by 2.7% for pixel accuracy and 5.8% for mIoU (5 grid points). On the semantic segmentation task, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art by 8.8% for pixel accuracy and by 13.5% for mIoU when only 5 point labels are used for point label propagation. Additionally, we perform a comprehensive study into the impacts of the point label placement style and the number of points on the point label propagation quality, and make several recommendations for improving the efficiency of labeling images with points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores innovative methods for improving Visual Question Answering (VQA) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), autoencoders, and attention mechanisms. Leveraging a balanced VQA dataset, we investigate three distinct strategies. Firstly, GAN-based approaches aim to generate answer embeddings conditioned on image and question inputs, showing potential but struggling with more complex tasks. Secondly, autoencoder-based techniques focus on learning optimal embeddings for questions and images, achieving comparable results with GAN due to better ability on complex questions. Lastly, attention mechanisms, incorporating Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB), address language priors and attention modeling, albeit with a complexity-performance trade-off. This study underscores the challenges and opportunities in VQA and suggests avenues for future research, including alternative GAN formulations and attentional mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on Enhancing Prediction in Social Network Advertisement through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of social network advertising, the volume and accuracy of data play a critical role in the performance of predictive models. However, the development of robust predictive algorithms is often hampered by the limited size and potential bias present in real-world datasets. This study presents and explores a generative augmentation framework of social network advertising data. Our framework explores three generative models for data augmentation - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) - to enrich data availability and diversity in the context of social network advertising analytics effectiveness. By performing synthetic extensions of the feature space, we find that through data augmentation, the performance of various classifiers has been quantitatively improved. Furthermore, we compare the relative performance gains brought by each data augmentation technique, providing insights for practitioners to select appropriate techniques to enhance model performance. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that synthetic data augmentation alleviates the limitations imposed by small or imbalanced datasets in the field of social network advertising. At the same time, this article also provides a comparative perspective on the practicality of different data augmentation methods, thereby guiding practitioners to choose appropriate techniques to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalist Robot Learning from Internet Video: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling deep learning to massive, diverse internet data has yielded remarkably general capabilities in visual and natural language understanding and generation. However, data has remained scarce and challenging to collect in robotics, seeing robot learning struggle to obtain similarly general capabilities. Promising Learning from Videos (LfV) methods aim to address the robotics data bottleneck by augmenting traditional robot data with large-scale internet video data. This video data offers broad foundational information regarding physical behaviour and the underlying physics of the world, and thus can be highly informative for a generalist robot.
  In this survey, we present a thorough overview of the emerging field of LfV. We outline fundamental concepts, including the benefits and challenges of LfV. We provide a comprehensive review of current methods for extracting knowledge from large-scale internet video, addressing key challenges in LfV, and boosting downstream robot and reinforcement learning via the use of video data. The survey concludes with a critical discussion of challenges and opportunities in LfV. Here, we advocate for scalable foundation model approaches that can leverage the full range of available internet video to improve the learning of robot policies and dynamics models. We hope this survey can inform and catalyse further LfV research, driving progress towards the development of general-purpose robots.</description>

      <title>SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model (LM) agents are increasingly being used to automate complicated tasks in digital environments. Just as humans benefit from powerful software applications, such as integrated development environments, for complex tasks like software engineering, we posit that LM agents represent a new category of end users with their own needs and abilities, and would benefit from specially-built interfaces to the software they use. We investigate how interface design affects the performance of language model agents. As a result of this exploration, we introduce SWE-agent: a system that facilitates LM agents to autonomously use computers to solve software engineering tasks. SWE-agent's custom agent-computer interface (ACI) significantly enhances an agent's ability to create and edit code files, navigate entire repositories, and execute tests and other programs. We evaluate SWE-agent on SWE-bench and HumanEvalFix, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both with a pass@1 rate of 12.5% and 87.7%, respectively, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art achieved with non-interactive LMs. Finally, we provide insight on how the design of the ACI can impact agents' behavior and performance.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations - DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$ discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets, which calls for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Know Your Neighborhood: General and Zero-Shot Capable Binary Function Search Powered by Call Graphlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is an important problem with applications in areas such as malware analysis, vulnerability research and license violation detection. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network architecture combined with a novel graph data representation called call graphlets. A call graphlet encodes the neighborhood around each function in a binary executable, capturing the local and global context through a series of statistical features. A specialized graph neural network model operates on this graph representation, learning to map it to a feature vector that encodes semantic binary code similarities using deep-metric learning. The proposed approach is evaluated across five distinct datasets covering different architectures, compiler tool chains, and optimization levels. Experimental results show that the combination of call graphlets and the novel graph neural network architecture achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques across cross-architecture, mono-architecture and zero shot tasks. In addition, our proposed approach also performs well when evaluated against an out-of-domain function inlining task. The work provides a general and effective graph neural network-based solution for conducting binary code similarity detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of various online and mobile payment systems, transaction fraud has become a significant threat to financial security. This study explores the application of advanced machine learning models, specifically based on XGBoost and LightGBM, for developing a more accurate and robust Payment Security Protection Model. To enhance data reliability, we meticulously processed the data sources and applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance and improve data representation. By selecting highly correlated features, we aimed to strengthen the training process and boost model performance. We conducted thorough performance evaluations of our proposed models, comparing them against traditional methods including Random Forest, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, we rigorously assessed their effectiveness. Our detailed analyses and comparisons reveal that the combination of SMOTE with XGBoost and LightGBM offers a highly efficient and powerful mechanism for payment security protection. Moreover, the integration of XGBoost and LightGBM in a Local Ensemble model further demonstrated outstanding performance. After incorporating SMOTE, the new combined model achieved a significant improvement of nearly 6\% over traditional models and around 5\% over its sub-models, showcasing remarkable results.</description>

      <title>SLOctolyzer: Fully automatic analysis toolkit for segmentation and feature extracting in scanning laser ophthalmoscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to introduce SLOctolyzer: an open-source analysis toolkit for en face retinal vessels in infrared reflectance scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images.
  Methods: SLOctolyzer includes two main modules: segmentation and measurement. The segmentation module uses deep learning methods to delineate retinal anatomy, and detects the fovea and optic disc, whereas the measurement module quantifies the complexity, density, tortuosity, and calibre of the segmented retinal vessels. We evaluated the segmentation module using unseen data and measured its reproducibility.
  Results: SLOctolyzer's segmentation module performed well against unseen internal test data (Dice for all-vessels = 0.91; arteries = 0.84; veins = 0.85; optic disc = 0.94; and fovea = 0.88). External validation against severe retinal pathology showed decreased performance (Dice for arteries = 0.72; veins = 0.75; and optic disc = 0.90). SLOctolyzer had good reproducibility (mean difference for fractal dimension = -0.001; density = -0.0003; calibre = -0.32 microns; and tortuosity density = 0.001). SLOctolyzer can process a 768 x 768 pixel macula-centred SLO image in under 20 seconds and a disc-centred SLO image in under 30 seconds using a laptop CPU.
  Conclusions: To our knowledge, SLOctolyzer is the first open-source tool to convert raw SLO images into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinal vascular parameters. SLO images are captured simultaneous to optical coherence tomography (OCT), and we believe SLOctolyzer will be useful for extracting retinal vascular measurements from large OCT image sets and linking them to ocular or systemic diseases. It requires no specialist knowledge or proprietary software, and allows manual correction of segmentations and re-computing of vascular metrics.

      <title>Scalar Function Topology Divergence: Comparing Topology of 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we show that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.</description>

      <title>LiCoEval: Evaluating LLMs on License Compliance in Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, leading to widespread adoption of AI coding tools by developers. However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production. This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code. To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code. Based on this standard, we propose LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs, i.e., the ability to provide accurate license or copyright information when they generate code with striking similarity to already existing copyrighted code. Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations. Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks. Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable Sequence Models Can Naturally Quantify Uncertainty Over Latent Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent agents must be able to articulate its own uncertainty. In this work, we show that pre-trained sequence models are naturally capable of probabilistic reasoning over exchangeable data points -- forming informed beliefs and sharpening them as it gathers more information. A sequence model learns the relationship between observations, which differs from typical Bayesian models that quantify uncertainty over latent parameters through priors and likelihoods (e.g., topic models). Despite the apparent difference, we illustrate how exchangeable sequence modeling provides a valid Bayesian model by going back to De Finetti's classical predictive view of probabilistic reasoning: uncertainty comes from data that has not been observed yet, rather than latent parameters. From this perspective, pre-training autoregressive models is equivalent to formulating informed beliefs based on prior observations ("empirical Bayes"), and forward generation is equivalent to simulating instantiations of an environment ("posterior inference"). In particular, exchangeable sequence models can explicitly perform statistical inference; epistemic uncertainty over latent environments is captured by variation in predicted future observations. Formally, we show the sequence prediction loss controls the quality of uncertainty quantification, and propose several approaches for encoding exchangeability in sequence model architectures: data augmentation, regularization, and causal masking.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Earnings Reports for Stock Predictions: A QLoRA-Enhanced LLM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate stock market predictions following earnings reports are crucial for investors. Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted F1, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI-driven financial analysis tools.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then discusses the benefits, functions, and challenges of ISCC. Subsequently, the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC are explored. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks, and the unresolved issues requiring further investigation. ISCC is expected to unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic Iterative Planning for Robust POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust POMDPs extend classical POMDPs to handle model uncertainty. Specifically, robust POMDPs exhibit so-called uncertainty sets on the transition and observation models, effectively defining ranges of probabilities. Policies for robust POMDPs must be (1) memory-based to account for partial observability and (2) robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case instances from the uncertainty sets. To compute such robust memory-based policies, we propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting a pessimistic (non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this pessimistic POMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and use this evaluation in step (1) to select the next pessimistic POMDP. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC through a recurrent neural network by using supervision policies optimized for the pessimistic POMDP. The empirical evaluation in four benchmark environments showcases improved robustness against several baseline methods and competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning with CNNs: A Compact Holistic Tutorial with Focus on Supervised Regression (Preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present a compact and holistic discussion of Deep Learning with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and supervised regression. While there are numerous books and articles on the individual topics we cover, comprehensive and detailed tutorials that address Deep Learning from a foundational yet rigorous and accessible perspective are rare. Most resources on CNNs are either too advanced, focusing on cutting-edge architectures, or too narrow, addressing only specific applications like image classification.This tutorial not only summarizes the most relevant concepts but also provides an in-depth exploration of each, offering a complete yet agile set of ideas. Moreover, we highlight the powerful synergy between learning theory, statistic, and machine learning, which together underpin the Deep Learning and CNN frameworks. We aim for this tutorial to serve as an optimal resource for students, professors, and anyone interested in understanding the foundations of Deep Learning. Upon acceptance we will provide an accompanying repository under \href{https://github.com/neoglez/deep-learning-tutorial}{https://github.com/neoglez/deep-learning-tutorial}

      <title>Grounding Large Language Models In Embodied Environment With Imperfect World Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a widespread success in various applications, large language models (LLMs) often stumble when tackling basic physical reasoning or executing robotics tasks, due to a lack of direct experience with the physical nuances of the real world. To address these issues, we propose a Grounding Large language model with Imperfect world MOdel (GLIMO), which utilizes proxy world models such as simulators to collect and synthesize trining data. GLIMO incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator to automatically create high-quality and diverse instruction datasets. The generator includes an iterative self-refining module for temporally consistent experience sampling, a diverse set of question-answering instruction seeds, and a retrieval-augmented generation module for reflecting on prior experiences. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach improve the performance of strong open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3 with a performance boost of 2.04 $\times$, 1.54 $\times$, and 1.82 $\times$ across three different benchmarks, respectively. The performance is able to compete with or surpass their larger counterparts such as GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Interpret Your Decision: Logical Reasoning Regularization for Generalization in Visual Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04492v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision models excel in image classification but struggle to generalize to unseen data, such as classifying images from unseen domains or discovering novel categories. In this paper, we explore the relationship between logical reasoning and deep learning generalization in visual classification. A logical regularization termed L-Reg is derived which bridges a logical analysis framework to image classification. Our work reveals that L-Reg reduces the complexity of the model in terms of the feature distribution and classifier weights. Specifically, we unveil the interpretability brought by L-Reg, as it enables the model to extract the salient features, such as faces to persons, for classification. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that L-Reg enhances generalization across various scenarios, including multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery. In complex real-world scenarios where images span unknown classes and unseen domains, L-Reg consistently improves generalization, highlighting its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Adaptive Experimental Design for Estimating Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given n experiment subjects with potentially heterogeneous covariates and two possible treatments, namely active treatment and control, this paper addresses the fundamental question of determining the optimal accuracy in estimating the treatment effect. Furthermore, we propose an experimental design that approaches this optimal accuracy, giving a (non-asymptotic) answer to this fundamental yet still open question. The methodological contribution is listed as following. First, we establish an idealized optimal estimator with minimal variance as benchmark, and then demonstrate that adaptive experiment is necessary to achieve near-optimal estimation accuracy. Secondly, by incorporating the concept of doubly robust method into sequential experimental design, we frame the optimal estimation problem as an online bandit learning problem, bridging the two fields of statistical estimation and bandit learning. Using tools and ideas from both bandit algorithm design and adaptive statistical estimation, we propose a general low switching adaptive experiment framework, which could be a generic research paradigm for a wide range of adaptive experimental design. Through novel lower bound techniques for non-i.i.d. data, we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed experiment. Numerical result indicates that the estimation accuracy approaches optimal with as few as two or three policy updates.</description>

Abstract: Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) aim at recovering privacy-sensitive training data from the knowledge encoded in the released machine learning models. Recent advances in the MIA field have significantly enhanced the attack performance under multiple scenarios, posing serious privacy risks of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the development of defense strategies against MIAs is relatively backward to resist the latest MIAs and existing defenses fail to achieve further trade-off between model utility and model robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis from the perspective of intrinsic vulnerabilities of MIAs, comprehensively uncovering the weaknesses inherent in the basic pipeline, which are partially investigated in the previous defenses. Building upon these new insights, we propose a robust defense mechanism, integrating Confidence Adaptation and Low-Rank compression(CALoR). Our method includes a novel robustness-enhanced classification loss specially-designed for model inversion defenses and reveals the extraordinary effectiveness of compressing the classification header. With CALoR, we can mislead the optimization objective, reduce the leaked information and impede the backpropagation of MIAs, thus mitigating the risk of privacy leakage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense performance against MIAs and exhibits superior generalization to existing defenses across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>LLMs Can Evolve Continually on Modality for X-Modal Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention due to their impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding. However, existing methods rely heavily on extensive modal-specific pretraining and joint-modal tuning, leading to significant computational burdens when expanding to new modalities. In this paper, we propose PathWeave, a flexible and scalable framework with modal-Path sWitching and ExpAnsion abilities that enables MLLMs to continually EVolve on modalities for $\mathbb{X}$-modal reasoning. We leverage the concept of Continual Learning and develop an incremental training strategy atop pre-trained MLLMs, enabling their expansion to new modalities using uni-modal data, without executing joint-modal pretraining. In detail, a novel Adapter-in-Adapter (AnA) framework is introduced, in which uni-modal and cross-modal adapters are seamlessly integrated to facilitate efficient modality alignment and collaboration. Additionally, an MoE-based gating module is applied between two types of adapters to further enhance the multimodal interaction. To investigate the proposed method, we establish a challenging benchmark called Continual Learning of Modality (MCL), which consists of high-quality QA data from five distinct modalities: image, video, audio, depth and point cloud. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AnA framework on learning plasticity and memory stability during continual learning.

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark-conditioned Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Simple is Effective: The Roles of Graphs and Large Language Models in Knowledge-Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities but face limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph (KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in structured external knowledge from KGs. However, current KG-based RAG frameworks still struggle to optimize the trade-off between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency in identifying a suitable amount of relevant graph information for the LLM to digest. We introduce SubgraphRAG, extending the KG-based RAG framework that retrieves subgraphs and leverages LLMs for reasoning and answer prediction. Our approach innovatively integrates a lightweight multilayer perceptron with a parallel triple-scoring mechanism for efficient and flexible subgraph retrieval while encoding directional structural distances to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The size of retrieved subgraphs can be flexibly adjusted to match the query's need and the downstream LLM's capabilities. This design strikes a balance between model complexity and reasoning power, enabling scalable and generalizable retrieval processes. Notably, based on our retrieved subgraphs, smaller LLMs like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct deliver competitive results with explainable reasoning, while larger models like GPT-4o achieve state-of-the-art accuracy compared with previous baselines -- all without fine-tuning. Extensive evaluations on the WebQSP and CWQ benchmarks highlight SubgraphRAG's strengths in efficiency, accuracy, and reliability by reducing hallucinations and improving response grounding.</description>

      <title>Context Parallelism for Scalable Million-Token Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian, structure and trace distance learning of Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of Hamiltonian learning for positive temperature bosonic Gaussian states, the quantum generalization of the widely studied problem of learning Gaussian graphical models. We obtain efficient protocols, both in sample and computational complexity, for the task of inferring the parameters of their underlying quadratic Hamiltonian under the assumption of bounded temperature, squeezing, displacement and maximal degree of the interaction graph. Our protocol only requires heterodyne measurements, which are often experimentally feasible, and has a sample complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of modes. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to learn the underlying interaction graph in a similar setting and sample complexity. Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a much more advanced state when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either unavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our techniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace distance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of modes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main technical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and Hamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest, combined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local inversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian state by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose size scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way we bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix, controlling the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic LLM: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees.
  To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself.
  Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.

      <title>Gaussian Process Emulators for Few-Shot Segmentation in Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI) is crucial for the analysis and assessment of cardiac function, helping to diagnose and treat various cardiovascular diseases. Most recent techniques rely on deep learning and usually require an extensive amount of labeled data. To overcome this problem, few-shot learning has the capability of reducing data dependency on labeled data. In this work, we introduce a new method that merges few-shot learning with a U-Net architecture and Gaussian Process Emulators (GPEs), enhancing data integration from a support set for improved performance. GPEs are trained to learn the relation between the support images and the corresponding masks in latent space, facilitating the segmentation of unseen query images given only a small labeled support set at inference. We test our model with the M&amp;Ms-2 public dataset to assess its ability to segment the heart in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging from different orientations, and compare it with state-of-the-art unsupervised and few-shot methods. Our architecture shows higher DICE coefficients compared to these methods, especially in the more challenging setups where the size of the support set is considerably small.</description>

      <title>OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Add-it: Training-Free Object Insertion in Images With Pretrained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adding Object into images based on text instructions is a challenging task in semantic image editing, requiring a balance between preserving the original scene and seamlessly integrating the new object in a fitting location. Despite extensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance, particularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complex scenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion models' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources: the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted extended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details while ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image insertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed "Additing Affordance Benchmark" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming supervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80% of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.</description>
