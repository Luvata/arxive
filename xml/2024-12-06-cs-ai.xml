      <title>Applying IRT to Distinguish Between Human and Generative AI Responses to Multiple-Choice Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for the application of IRT to identify AI cheating in MCQ-based assessments.</description>

      <title>Shaping AI's Impact on Billions of Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transformer heart disease prediction model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming at the latest particle swarm optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an improved Transformer model to improve the accuracy of heart disease prediction and provide a new algorithm idea. We first use three mainstream machine learning classification algorithms - decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, and then output the confusion matrix of these three models. The results showed that the random forest model had the best performance in predicting the classification of heart disease, with an accuracy of 92.2%. Then, we apply the Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to the same dataset for classification experiment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the model is as high as 96.5%, 4.3 percentage points higher than that of random forest, which verifies the effectiveness of PSO in optimizing Transformer model. From the above research, we can see that particle swarm optimization significantly improves Transformer performance in heart disease prediction. Improving the ability to predict heart disease is a global priority with benefits for all humankind. Accurate prediction can enhance public health, optimize medical resources, and reduce healthcare costs, leading to healthier populations and more productive societies worldwide. This advancement paves the way for more efficient health management and supports the foundation of a healthier, more resilient global community.</description>

      <title>Flattering to Deceive: The Impact of Sycophantic Behavior on User Trust in Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sycophancy refers to the tendency of a large language model to align its outputs with the user's perceived preferences, beliefs, or opinions, in order to look favorable, regardless of whether those statements are factually correct. This behavior can lead to undesirable consequences, such as reinforcing discriminatory biases or amplifying misinformation. Given that sycophancy is often linked to human feedback training mechanisms, this study explores whether sycophantic tendencies negatively impact user trust in large language models or, conversely, whether users consider such behavior as favorable. To investigate this, we instructed one group of participants to answer ground-truth questions with the assistance of a GPT specifically designed to provide sycophantic responses, while another group used the standard version of ChatGPT. Initially, participants were required to use the language model, after which they were given the option to continue using it if they found it trustworthy and useful. Trust was measured through both demonstrated actions and self-reported perceptions. The findings consistently show that participants exposed to sycophantic behavior reported and exhibited lower levels of trust compared to those who interacted with the standard version of the model, despite the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the model's output.</description>

      <title>A Novel Compact LLM Framework for Local, High-Privacy EHR Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing, yet their use in sensitive domains like healthcare, particularly with Electronic Health Records (EHR), faces significant challenges due to privacy concerns and limited computational resources. This paper presents a compact LLM framework designed for local deployment in settings with strict privacy requirements and limited access to high-performance GPUs. We introduce a novel preprocessing technique that uses information extraction methods, e.g., regular expressions, to filter and emphasize critical information in clinical notes, enhancing the performance of smaller LLMs on EHR data. Our framework is evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms on both private and publicly available (MIMIC-IV) datasets, and we also compare its performance with fine-tuned LLMs on the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results demonstrate that our preprocessing approach significantly boosts the prediction accuracy of smaller LLMs, making them suitable for high-privacy, resource-constrained applications. This study offers valuable insights into optimizing LLM performance for sensitive, data-intensive tasks while addressing computational and privacy limitations.</description>

      <title>Constrained Identifiability of Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the identification of causal effects in the presence of different types of constraints (e.g., logical constraints) in addition to the causal graph. These constraints impose restrictions on the models (parameterizations) induced by the causal graph, reducing the set of models considered by the identifiability problem. We formalize the notion of constrained identifiability, which takes a set of constraints as another input to the classical definition of identifiability. We then introduce a framework for testing constrained identifiability by employing tractable Arithmetic Circuits (ACs), which enables us to accommodate constraints systematically. We show that this AC-based approach is at least as complete as existing algorithms (e.g., do-calculus) for testing classical identifiability, which only assumes the constraint of strict positivity. We use examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of this AC-based approach by showing that unidentifiable causal effects may become identifiable under different types of constraints.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Based Docking Methods: Fair Comparisons to Conventional Docking Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion learning method, DiffDock, for docking small-molecule ligands into protein binding sites was recently introduced. Results included comparisons to more conventional docking approaches, with DiffDock showing superior performance. Here, we employ a fully automatic workflow using the Surflex-Dock methods to generate a fair baseline for conventional docking approaches. Results were generated for the common and expected situation where a binding site location is known and also for the condition of an unknown binding site. For the known binding site condition, Surflex-Dock success rates at 2.0 Angstroms RMSD far exceeded those for DiffDock (Top-1/Top-5 success rates, respectively, were 68/81% compared with 45/51%). Glide performed with similar success rates (67/73%) to Surflex-Dock for the known binding site condition, and results for AutoDock Vina and Gnina followed this pattern. For the unknown binding site condition, using an automated method to identify multiple binding pockets, Surflex-Dock success rates again exceeded those of DiffDock, but by a somewhat lesser margin. DiffDock made use of roughly 17,000 co-crystal structures for learning (98% of PDBBind version 2020, pre-2019 structures) for a training set in order to predict on 363 test cases (2% of PDBBind 2020) from 2019 forward. DiffDock's performance was inextricably linked with the presence of near-neighbor cases of close to identical protein-ligand complexes in the training set for over half of the test set cases. DiffDock exhibited a 40 percentage point difference on near-neighbor cases (two-thirds of all test cases) compared with cases with no near-neighbor training case. DiffDock has apparently encoded a type of table-lookup during its learning process, rendering meaningful applications beyond its reach. Further, it does not perform even close to competitively with a competently run modern docking workflow.</description>

      <title>STDCformer: A Transformer-Based Model with a Spatial-Temporal Causal De-Confounding Strategy for Crowd Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works typically treat spatial-temporal prediction as the task of learning a function $F$ to transform historical observations to future observations. We further decompose this cross-time transformation into three processes: (1) Encoding ($E$): learning the intrinsic representation of observations, (2) Cross-Time Mapping ($M$): transforming past representations into future representations, and (3) Decoding ($D$): reconstructing future observations from the future representations. From this perspective, spatial-temporal prediction can be viewed as learning $F = E \cdot M \cdot D$, which includes learning the space transformations $\left\{{E},{D}\right\}$ between the observation space and the hidden representation space, as well as the spatial-temporal mapping $M$ from future states to past states within the representation space. This leads to two key questions: \textbf{Q1: What kind of representation space allows for mapping the past to the future? Q2: How to achieve map the past to the future within the representation space?} To address Q1, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Backdoor Adjustment strategy, which learns a Spatial-Temporal De-Confounded (STDC) representation space and estimates the de-confounding causal effect of historical data on future data. This causal relationship we captured serves as the foundation for subsequent spatial-temporal mapping. To address Q2, we design a Spatial-Temporal Embedding (STE) that fuses the information of temporal and spatial confounders, capturing the intrinsic spatial-temporal characteristics of the representations. Additionally, we introduce a Cross-Time Attention mechanism, which queries the attention between the future and the past to guide spatial-temporal mapping.</description>

      <title>Specification Generation for Neural Networks in Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specifications - precise mathematical representations of correct domain-specific behaviors - are crucial to guarantee the trustworthiness of computer systems. With the increasing development of neural networks as computer system components, specifications gain more importance as they can be used to regulate the behaviors of these black-box models. Traditionally, specifications are designed by domain experts based on their intuition of correct behavior. However, this is labor-intensive and hence not a scalable approach as computer system applications diversify. We hypothesize that the traditional (aka reference) algorithms that neural networks replace for higher performance can act as effective proxies for correct behaviors of the models, when available. This is because they have been used and tested for long enough to encode several aspects of the trustworthy/correct behaviors in the underlying domain. Driven by our hypothesis, we develop a novel automated framework, SpecTRA to generate specifications for neural networks using references. We formulate specification generation as an optimization problem and solve it with observations of reference behaviors. SpecTRA clusters similar observations into compact specifications. We present specifications generated by SpecTRA for neural networks in adaptive bit rate and congestion control algorithms. Our specifications show evidence of being correct and matching intuition. Moreover, we use our specifications to show several unknown vulnerabilities of the SOTA models for computer systems.</description>

      <title>Preference-based opponent shaping in differentiable games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategy learning in game environments with multi-agent is a challenging problem. Since each agent's reward is determined by the joint strategy, a greedy learning strategy that aims to maximize its own reward may fall into a local optimum. Recent studies have proposed the opponent modeling and shaping methods for game environments. These methods enhance the efficiency of strategy learning by modeling the strategies and updating processes of other agents. However, these methods often rely on simple predictions of opponent strategy changes. Due to the lack of modeling behavioral preferences such as cooperation and competition, they are usually applicable only to predefined scenarios and lack generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel Preference-based Opponent Shaping (PBOS) method to enhance the strategy learning process by shaping agents' preferences towards cooperation. We introduce the preference parameter, which is incorporated into the agent's loss function, thus allowing the agent to directly consider the opponent's loss function when updating the strategy. We update the preference parameters concurrently with strategy learning to ensure that agents can adapt to any cooperative or competitive game environment. Through a series of experiments, we verify the performance of PBOS algorithm in a variety of differentiable games. The experimental results show that the PBOS algorithm can guide the agent to learn the appropriate preference parameters, so as to achieve better reward distribution in multiple game environments.</description>

      <title>ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&amp;As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>CredID: Credible Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in complex natural language processing tasks but raise privacy and security concerns due to the lack of identity recognition. This paper proposes a multi-party credible watermarking framework (CredID) involving a trusted third party (TTP) and multiple LLM vendors to address these issues. In the watermark embedding stage, vendors request a seed from the TTP to generate watermarked text without sending the user's prompt. In the extraction stage, the TTP coordinates each vendor to extract and verify the watermark from the text. This provides a credible watermarking scheme while preserving vendor privacy. Furthermore, current watermarking algorithms struggle with text quality, information capacity, and robustness, making it challenging to meet the diverse identification needs of LLMs. Thus, we propose a novel multi-bit watermarking algorithm and an open-source toolkit to facilitate research. Experiments show our CredID enhances watermark credibility and efficiency without compromising text quality. Additionally, we successfully utilized this framework to achieve highly accurate identification among multiple LLM vendors.</description>

      <title>Experience-driven discovery of planning strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One explanation for how people can plan efficiently despite limited cognitive resources is that we possess a set of adaptive planning strategies and know when and how to use them. But how are these strategies acquired? While previous research has studied how individuals learn to choose among existing strategies, little is known about the process of forming new planning strategies. In this work, we propose that new planning strategies are discovered through metacognitive reinforcement learning. To test this, we designed a novel experiment to investigate the discovery of new planning strategies. We then present metacognitive reinforcement learning models and demonstrate their capability for strategy discovery as well as show that they provide a better explanation of human strategy discovery than alternative learning mechanisms. However, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower discovery rate than humans, leaving room for improvement.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-bit Text Watermark with LLM-based Paraphrasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an imperceptible multi-bit text watermark embedded by paraphrasing with LLMs. We fine-tune a pair of LLM paraphrasers that are designed to behave differently so that their paraphrasing difference reflected in the text semantics can be identified by a trained decoder. To embed our multi-bit watermark, we use two paraphrasers alternatively to encode the pre-defined binary code at the sentence level. Then we use a text classifier as the decoder to decode each bit of the watermark. Through extensive experiments, we show that our watermarks can achieve over 99.99\% detection AUC with small (1.1B) text paraphrasers while keeping the semantic information of the original sentence. More importantly, our pipeline is robust under word substitution and sentence paraphrasing perturbations and generalizes well to out-of-distributional data. We also show the stealthiness of our watermark with LLM-based evaluation. We open-source the code: https://github.com/xiaojunxu/multi-bit-text-watermark.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models show both individual and collective creativity comparable to humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has, so far, largely automated routine tasks, but what does it mean for the future of work if Large Language Models (LLMs) show creativity comparable to humans? To measure the creativity of LLMs holistically, the current study uses 13 creative tasks spanning three domains. We benchmark the LLMs against individual humans, and also take a novel approach by comparing them to the collective creativity of groups of humans. We find that the best LLMs (Claude and GPT-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against humans, and overall LLMs excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but lag in creative writing. When questioned 10 times, an LLM's collective creativity is equivalent to 8-10 humans. When more responses are requested, two additional responses of LLMs equal one extra human. Ultimately, LLMs, when optimally applied, may compete with a small group of humans in the future of work.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding and Quantifying Uncertainty for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image (T2I) generative models is crucial for understanding model behavior and improving output reliability. In this paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I models with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches designed to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce Prompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties arising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a LVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the original prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also enables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via precision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including bias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection. We also introduce a comprehensive dataset of text prompts and generation pairs to foster further research in uncertainty quantification for generative models. Our findings illustrate that PUNC not only achieves competitive performance but also enables novel applications in evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of text-to-image models.</description>

      <title>Contextual Data Integration for Bike-sharing Demand Prediction with Graph Neural Networks in Degraded Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand for bike sharing is impacted by various factors, such as weather conditions, events, and the availability of other transportation modes. This impact remains elusive due to the complex interdependence of these factors or locationrelated user behavior variations. It is also not clear which factor is additional information which are not already contained in the historical demand. Intermodal dependencies between bike-sharing and other modes are also underexplored, and the value of this information has not been studied in degraded situations. The proposed study analyzes the impact of adding contextual data, such as weather, time embedding, and road traffic flow, to predict bike-sharing Origin-Destination (OD) flows in atypical weather situations Our study highlights a mild relationship between prediction quality of bike-sharing demand and road traffic flow, while the introduced time embedding allows outperforming state-of-the-art results, particularly in the case of degraded weather conditions. Including weather data as an additional input further improves our model with respect to the basic ST-ED-RMGC prediction model by reducing of more than 20% the prediction error in degraded weather condition.</description>

      <title>WiS Platform: Enhancing Evaluation of LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems Through Game-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the application scenarios and improved the capability of LLMs to handle complex tasks. Despite demonstrating effectiveness, existing studies still evidently struggle to evaluate, analysis, and reproducibility of LLM-based MAS. In this paper, to facilitate the research on LLM-based MAS, we introduce an open, scalable, and real-time updated platform for accessing and analyzing the LLM-based MAS based on the games Who is Spy?" (WiS). Our platform is featured with three main worths: (1) a unified model evaluate interface that supports models available on Hugging Face; (2) real-time updated leaderboard for model evaluation; (3) a comprehensive evaluation covering game-winning rates, attacking, defense strategies, and reasoning of LLMs. To rigorously test WiS, we conduct extensive experiments coverage of various open- and closed-source LLMs, we find that different agents exhibit distinct and intriguing behaviors in the game. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our platform in evaluating LLM-based MAS. Our platform and its documentation are publicly available at \url{https://whoisspy.ai/}</description>

      <title>From Words to Workflows: Automating Business Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As businesses increasingly rely on automation to streamline operations, the limitations of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have become apparent, particularly its dependence on expert knowledge and inability to handle complex decision-making tasks. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), have paved the way for Intelligent Automation (IA), which integrates cognitive capabilities to overcome the shortcomings of RPA. This paper introduces Text2Workflow, a novel method that automatically generates workflows from natural language user requests. Unlike traditional automation approaches, Text2Workflow offers a generalized solution for automating any business process, translating user inputs into a sequence of executable steps represented in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Leveraging the decision-making and instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, this method provides a scalable, adaptable framework that enables users to visualize and execute workflows with minimal manual intervention. This research outlines the Text2Workflow methodology and its broader implications for automating complex business processes.</description>

      <title>KKLIP: Knowledge Distillation Exploiting K-means Clustering for Language-Image Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, CLIP has emerged as a valuable model for aligning image and text information in multi-modal scenarios. However, researchers have observed limitations in the ability of CLIP's text and image encoders to extract detailed knowledge from caption-image pairs. In response, this paper introduces KKLIP, a novel approach designed to enhance the quality of CLIP by incorporating a new knowledge distillation (KD) method derived from Llama 2. Our method comprises three objectives: Text Embedding Distillation, Concept Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Firstly, Text Embedding Distillation involves training the KKLIP text encoder to emulate the teacher model, Llama 2. Secondly, Concept Learning assigns a soft concept label to each caption-image pair through offline k-means clustering of text information from Llama 2, allowing KKLIP to learn from these soft concept labels. Finally, Contrastive Learning harmonizes text and image embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that KKLIP enhances the quality of both text and image encoders.</description>

      <title>You're (Not) My Type -- Can LLMs Generate Feedback of Specific Types for Introductory Programming Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Feedback as one of the most influential factors for learning has been subject to a great body of research. It plays a key role in the development of educational technology systems and is traditionally rooted in deterministic feedback defined by experts and their experience. However, with the rise of generative AI and especially Large Language Models (LLMs), we expect feedback as part of learning systems to transform, especially for the context of programming. In the past, it was challenging to automate feedback for learners of programming. LLMs may create new possibilities to provide richer, and more individual feedback than ever before.
  Objectives: This paper aims to generate specific types of feedback for introductory programming tasks using LLMs. We revisit existing feedback taxonomies to capture the specifics of the generated feedback, such as randomness, uncertainty, and degrees of variation.
  Methods: We iteratively designed prompts for the generation of specific feedback types (as part of existing feedback taxonomies) in response to authentic student programs. We then evaluated the generated output and determined to what extent it reflected certain feedback types.
  Results and Conclusion: The present work provides a better understanding of different feedback dimensions and characteristics. The results have implications for future feedback research with regard to, for example, feedback effects and learners' informational needs. It further provides a basis for the development of new tools and learning systems for novice programmers including feedback generated by AI.</description>

      <title>The Matrix: Infinite-Horizon World Generation with Real-Time Moving Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present The Matrix, the first foundational realistic world simulator capable of generating continuous 720p high-fidelity real-scene video streams with real-time, responsive control in both first- and third-person perspectives, enabling immersive exploration of richly dynamic environments. Trained on limited supervised data from AAA games like Forza Horizon 5 and Cyberpunk 2077, complemented by large-scale unsupervised footage from real-world settings like Tokyo streets, The Matrix allows users to traverse diverse terrains -- deserts, grasslands, water bodies, and urban landscapes -- in continuous, uncut hour-long sequences. Operating at 16 FPS, the system supports real-time interactivity and demonstrates zero-shot generalization, translating virtual game environments to real-world contexts where collecting continuous movement data is often infeasible. For example, The Matrix can simulate a BMW X3 driving through an office setting--an environment present in neither gaming data nor real-world sources. This approach showcases the potential of AAA game data to advance robust world models, bridging the gap between simulations and real-world applications in scenarios with limited data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prior research, we analyzed the backwards swimming motion of mosquito larvae, parameterized it, and replicated it in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. Since the parameterized swimming motion is copied from observed larvae, it is not necessarily the most efficient locomotion for the model of the swimmer. In this project, we further optimize this copied solution for the swimmer model. We utilize Reinforcement Learning to guide local parameter updates. Since the majority of the computation cost arises from the CFD model, we additionally train a deep learning model to replicate the forces acting on the swimmer model. We find that this method is effective at performing local search to improve the parameterized swimming locomotion.</description>

      <title>Enhanced N-BEATS for Mid-Term Electricity Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced N-BEATS model, N-BEATS*, for improved mid-term electricity load forecasting (MTLF). Building on the strengths of the original N-BEATS architecture, which excels in handling complex time series data without requiring preprocessing or domain-specific knowledge, N-BEATS* introduces two key modifications. (1) A novel loss function -- combining pinball loss based on MAPE with normalized MSE, the new loss function allows for a more balanced approach by capturing both L1 and L2 loss terms. (2) A modified block architecture -- the internal structure of the N-BEATS blocks is adjusted by introducing a destandardization component to harmonize the processing of different time series, leading to more efficient and less complex forecasting tasks. Evaluated on real-world monthly electricity consumption data from 35 European countries, N-BEATS* demonstrates superior performance compared to its predecessor and other established forecasting methods, including statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models. N-BEATS* achieves the lowest MAPE and RMSE, while also exhibiting the lowest dispersion in forecast errors.</description>

      <title>DYffCast: Regional Precipitation Nowcasting Using IMERG Satellite Data. A case study over South America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is increasing the frequency of extreme precipitation events, making weather disasters such as flooding and landslides more likely. The ability to accurately nowcast precipitation is therefore becoming more critical for safeguarding society by providing immediate, accurate information to decision makers. Motivated by the recent success of generative models at precipitation nowcasting, this paper: extends the DYffusion framework to this task and evaluates its performance at forecasting IMERG satellite precipitation data up to a 4-hour horizon; modifies the DYffusion framework to improve its ability to model rainfall data; and introduces a novel loss function that combines MSE, MAE and the LPIPS perceptual score. In a quantitative evaluation of forecasts up to a 4-hour horizon, the modified DYffusion framework trained with the novel loss outperforms four competitor models. It has the highest CSI scores for weak, moderate, and heavy rain thresholds and retains an LPIPS score $&lt;$ 0.2 for the entire roll-out, degrading the least as lead-time increases. The proposed nowcasting model demonstrates visually stable and sharp forecasts up to a 2-hour horizon on a heavy rain case study.

      <title>Drawing Pandas: A Benchmark for LLMs in Generating Plotting Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the human-curated PandasPlotBench dataset, designed to evaluate language models' effectiveness as assistants in visual data exploration. Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations. Our benchmark is available online: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/plot_bench. The code for running the benchmark is also available: https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/PandasPlotBench.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Large Language Models for Turkish: New Methodologies in Corpus Selection and Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop and assess new corpus selection and training methodologies to improve the effectiveness of Turkish language models. Specifically, we adapted Large Language Model generated datasets and translated English datasets into Turkish, integrating these resources into the training process. This approach led to substantial enhancements in model accuracy for both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. Furthermore, the merging of these adapted models was found to markedly improve their performance. Human evaluative metrics, including task-specific performance assessments, further demonstrated that these adapted models possess a greater aptitude for comprehending the Turkish language and addressing logic-based queries. This research underscores the importance of refining corpus selection strategies to optimize the performance of multilingual models, particularly for under-resourced languages like Turkish.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We saturate a high-school-level hacking benchmark with plain LLM agent design. Concretely, we obtain 95% performance on InterCode-CTF, a popular offensive security benchmark, using prompting, tool use, and multiple attempts. This beats prior work by Phuong et al. 2024 (29%) and Abramovich et al. 2024 (72%).
  Our results suggest that current LLMs have surpassed the high school level in offensive cybersecurity. Their hacking capabilities remain underelicited: our ReAct&amp;Plan prompting strategy solves many challenges in 1-2 turns without complex engineering or advanced harnessing.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Development of Perovskite Memristors and Algorithms for Robust Analog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising solution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like perovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in material diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation for device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these memristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic methodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and develop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities of these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on usability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions for perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed "BayesMulti", a DNN training strategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of analog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that within a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor non-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated approach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks, which significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image classification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large vision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further validate our methodology on a 10$\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor crossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy consumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization of various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.</description>

      <title>WxC-Bench: A Novel Dataset for Weather and Climate Downstream Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality machine learning (ML)-ready datasets play a foundational role in developing new artificial intelligence (AI) models or fine-tuning existing models for scientific applications such as weather and climate analysis. Unfortunately, despite the growing development of new deep learning models for weather and climate, there is a scarcity of curated, pre-processed machine learning (ML)-ready datasets. Curating such high-quality datasets for developing new models is challenging particularly because the modality of the input data varies significantly for different downstream tasks addressing different atmospheric scales (spatial and temporal). Here we introduce WxC-Bench (Weather and Climate Bench), a multi-modal dataset designed to support the development of generalizable AI models for downstream use-cases in weather and climate research. WxC-Bench is designed as a dataset of datasets for developing ML-models for a complex weather and climate system, addressing selected downstream tasks as machine learning phenomenon. WxC-Bench encompasses several atmospheric processes from meso-$\beta$ (20 - 200 km) scale to synoptic scales (2500 km), such as aviation turbulence, hurricane intensity and track monitoring, weather analog search, gravity wave parameterization, and natural language report generation. We provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and also present a technical validation for baseline analysis. The dataset and code to prepare the ML-ready data have been made publicly available on Hugging Face -- https://huggingface.co/datasets/nasa-impact/WxC-Bench</description>

      <title>FathomGPT: A Natural Language Interface for Interactively Exploring Ocean Science Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FathomGPT, an open source system for the interactive investigation of ocean science data via a natural language interface. FathomGPT was developed in close collaboration with marine scientists to enable researchers to explore and analyze the FathomNet image database. FathomGPT provides a custom information retrieval pipeline that leverages OpenAI's large language models to enable: the creation of complex queries to retrieve images, taxonomic information, and scientific measurements; mapping common names and morphological features to scientific names; generating interactive charts on demand; and searching by image or specified patterns within an image. In designing FathomGPT, particular emphasis was placed on enhancing the user's experience by facilitating free-form exploration and optimizing response times. We present an architectural overview and implementation details of FathomGPT, along with a series of ablation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to name resolution, fine tuning, and prompt modification. We also present usage scenarios of interactive data exploration sessions and document feedback from ocean scientists and machine learning experts.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-SQuAD: Hybrid Scholarly Question Answering Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Scholarly Question Answering (QA) methods typically target homogeneous data sources, relying solely on either text or Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, scholarly information often spans heterogeneous sources, necessitating the development of QA systems that can integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data sources. To address this challenge, we introduce Hybrid-SQuAD (Hybrid Scholarly Question Answering Dataset), a novel large-scale QA dataset designed to facilitate answering questions incorporating both text and KG facts. The dataset consists of 10.5K question-answer pairs generated by a large language model, leveraging the KGs - DBLP and SemOpenAlex alongside corresponding text from Wikipedia. In addition, we propose a RAG-based baseline hybrid QA model, achieving an exact match score of 69.65 on the Hybrid-SQuAD test set.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Large Language Model for Hallucination Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of LLMs, like ChatGPT and Gemini, has marked the modern era of artificial intelligence applications characterized by high-impact applications generating text, images, and videos. However, these models usually ensue with one critical challenge called hallucination: confident presentation of inaccurate or fabricated information. This problem attracts serious concern when these models are applied to specialized domains, including healthcare and law, where the accuracy and preciseness of information are absolute conditions. In this paper, we propose EvoLLMs, an innovative framework inspired by Evolutionary Computation, which automates the generation of high-quality Question-answering (QA) datasets while minimizing hallucinations. EvoLLMs employs genetic algorithms, mimicking evolutionary processes like selection, variation, and mutation, to guide LLMs in generating accurate, contextually relevant question-answer pairs. Comparative analysis shows that EvoLLMs consistently outperforms human-generated datasets in key metrics such as Depth, Relevance, and Coverage, while nearly matching human performance in mitigating hallucinations. These results highlight EvoLLMs as a robust and efficient solution for QA dataset generation, significantly reducing the time and resources required for manual curation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Splatting Under Attack: Investigating Adversarial Noise in 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has advanced radiance field reconstruction, enabling high-quality view synthesis and fast rendering in 3D modeling. While adversarial attacks on object detection models are well-studied for 2D images, their impact on 3D models remains underexplored. This work introduces the Masked Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (M-IFGSM), designed to generate adversarial noise targeting the CLIP vision-language model. M-IFGSM specifically alters the object of interest by focusing perturbations on masked regions, degrading the performance of CLIP's zero-shot object detection capability when applied to 3D models. Using eight objects from the Common Objects 3D (CO3D) dataset, we demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the accuracy and confidence of the model, with adversarial noise being nearly imperceptible to human observers. The top-1 accuracy in original model renders drops from 95.4\% to 12.5\% for train images and from 91.2\% to 35.4\% for test images, with confidence levels reflecting this shift from true classification to misclassification, underscoring the risks of adversarial attacks on 3D models in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. The significance of this research lies in its potential to expose vulnerabilities in modern 3D vision models, including radiance fields, prompting the development of more robust defenses and security measures in critical real-world applications.</description>

      <title>CNNSum: Exploring Long-Conext Summarization with Large Language Models in Chinese Novels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in many long-context tasks. However, due to high annotation costs, high-quality long-context summary datasets for training or evaluation are scarce, limiting further research. In this work, we introduce CNNSum, a new multi-scale Chinese long-context novel summarization benchmark, including four subsets, length covering 16k\textasciitilde128k, 695 samples in total, the annotations are human-driven. We evaluate commercial and open-source models on CNNSum and conduct a detailed analysis. Based on the observations, we further conduct fine-tuning exploration with short-context summary data. In our study: (1) GPT-4o underperformed, due to excessive subjective commentary. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability, small LLMs with stable longer context lengths are the most cost-effective. Using long data concatenated from short-context summaries makes a significant improvement. (3) Prompt templates may cause a large performance gap but can be mitigated through fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tuned Chat or Instruction versions may harm the Base model and further fine-tuning cannot bridge performance gap. (5) while models with RoPE base scaling exhibit strong extrapolation potential, their performance may vary significantly when combined with other interpolation methods and need careful selection. (6) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance research in this field.</description>

Abstract: What factors contribute to the relative success and corresponding difficulties of in-context learning for Large Language Models (LLMs)? Drawing on insights from the literature on human concept learning, we test LLMs on carefully designed concept learning tasks, and show that task performance highly correlates with the Boolean complexity of the concept. This suggests that in-context learning exhibits a learning bias for simplicity in a way similar to humans.</description>

      <title>FLAME 3 Dataset: Unleashing the Power of Radiometric Thermal UAV Imagery for Wildfire Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing accessibility of radiometric thermal imaging sensors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers significant potential for advancing AI-driven aerial wildfire management. Radiometric imaging provides per-pixel temperature estimates, a valuable improvement over non-radiometric data that requires irradiance measurements to be converted into visible images using RGB color palettes. Despite its benefits, this technology has been underutilized largely due to a lack of available data for researchers. This study addresses this gap by introducing methods for collecting and processing synchronized visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery using UAVs at prescribed fires. The included imagery processing pipeline drastically simplifies and partially automates each step from data collection to neural network input. Further, we present the FLAME 3 dataset, the first comprehensive collection of side-by-side visual spectrum and radiometric thermal imagery of wildland fires. Building on our previous FLAME 1 and FLAME 2 datasets, FLAME 3 includes radiometric thermal Tag Image File Format (TIFFs) and nadir thermal plots, providing a new data type and collection method. This dataset aims to spur a new generation of machine learning models utilizing radiometric thermal imagery, potentially trivializing tasks such as aerial wildfire detection, segmentation, and assessment. A single-burn subset of FLAME 3 for computer vision applications is available on Kaggle with the full 6 burn set available to readers upon request.</description>

      <title>CAISSON: Concept-Augmented Inference Suite of Self-Organizing Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CAISSON, a novel hierarchical approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that transforms traditional single-vector search into a multi-view clustering framework. At its core, CAISSON leverages dual Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to create complementary organizational views of the document space, where each view captures different aspects of document relationships through specialized embeddings. The first view processes combined text and metadata embeddings, while the second operates on metadata enriched with concept embeddings, enabling a comprehensive multi-view analysis that captures both fine-grained semantic relationships and high-level conceptual patterns. This dual-view approach enables more nuanced document discovery by combining evidence from different organizational perspectives. To evaluate CAISSON, we develop SynFAQA, a framework for generating synthetic financial analyst notes and question-answer pairs that systematically tests different aspects of information retrieval capabilities. Drawing on HotPotQA's methodology for constructing multi-step reasoning questions, SynFAQA generates controlled test cases where each question is paired with the set of notes containing its ground-truth answer, progressing from simple single-entity queries to complex multi-hop retrieval tasks involving multiple entities and concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over both basic and enhanced RAG implementations, particularly for complex multi-entity queries, while maintaining practical response times suitable for interactive applications.</description>

Abstract: This research explores the integration of blockchain technology in healthcare, focusing on enhancing the security and efficiency of Electronic Health Record (EHR) management. We propose a novel Ethereum-based system that empowers patients with secure control over their medical data. Our approach addresses key challenges in healthcare blockchain implementation, including scalability, privacy, and regulatory compliance. The system incorporates digital signatures, Role-Based Access Control, and a multi-layered architecture to ensure secure, controlled access. We developed a decentralized application (dApp) with user-friendly interfaces for patients, doctors, and administrators, demonstrating the practical application of our solution. A survey among healthcare professionals and IT experts revealed strong interest in blockchain adoption, while also highlighting concerns about integration costs. The study explores future enhancements, including integration with IoT devices and AI-driven analytics, contributing to the evolution of secure, efficient, and interoperable healthcare systems that leverage cutting-edge technologies for improved patient care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The segmentation of histological images is critical for various biomedical applications, yet the lack of annotated data presents a significant challenge. We propose a microscopy pseudo labeling pipeline utilizing unsupervised image translation to address this issue. Our method generates pseudo labels by translating between labeled and unlabeled domains without requiring prior annotation in the target domain. We evaluate two pseudo labeling strategies across three image domains increasingly dissimilar from the labeled data, demonstrating their effectiveness. Notably, our method achieves a mean Dice score of $0.736 \pm 0.005$ on a SEM dataset using the tutoring path, which involves training a segmentation model on synthetic data created by translating the labeled dataset (TEM) to the target modality (SEM). This approach aims to accelerate the annotation process by providing high-quality pseudo labels as a starting point for manual refinement.</description>

      <title>Proximal Control of UAVs with Federated Learning for Human-Robot Collaborative Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human-robot interaction (HRI) is a growing area of research. In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.</description>

      <title>Memory-efficient Continual Learning with Neural Collapse Contrastive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has significantly improved representation quality, enhancing knowledge transfer across tasks in continual learning (CL). However, catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge, as contrastive based methods primarily focus on "soft relationships" or "softness" between samples, which shift with changing data distributions and lead to representation overlap across tasks. Recently, the newly identified Neural Collapse phenomenon has shown promise in CL by focusing on "hard relationships" or "hardness" between samples and fixed prototypes. However, this approach overlooks "softness", crucial for capturing intra-class variability, and this rigid focus can also pull old class representations toward current ones, increasing forgetting. Building on these insights, we propose Focal Neural Collapse Contrastive (FNC2), a novel representation learning loss that effectively balances both soft and hard relationships. Additionally, we introduce the Hardness-Softness Distillation (HSD) loss to progressively preserve the knowledge gained from these relationships across tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in minimizing memory reliance. Remarkably, even without the use of memory, our approach rivals rehearsal-based methods, offering a compelling solution for data privacy concerns.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection for Neurosymbolic Autonomous Cyber Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents for cyber applications take advantage of modern defense techniques by adopting intelligent agents with conventional and learning-enabled components. These intelligent agents are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, and can learn, adapt to, reason about and deploy security rules to defend networked computer systems while maintaining critical operational workflows. However, the knowledge available during training about the state of the operational network and its environment may be limited. The agents should be trustworthy so that they can reliably detect situations they cannot handle, and hand them over to cyber experts. In this work, we develop an out-of-distribution (OOD) Monitoring algorithm that uses a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to detect anomalous or OOD situations of RL-based agents with discrete states and discrete actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we integrate the OOD monitoring algorithm with a neurosymbolic autonomous cyber agent that uses behavior trees with learning-enabled components. We evaluate the proposed approach in a simulated cyber environment under different adversarial strategies. Experimental results over a large number of episodes illustrate the overall efficiency of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a causal modeling framework that captures the input-output behavior of predictive models (e.g., machine learning models) by representing it using causal graphs. The framework enables us to define and identify features that directly cause the predictions, which has broad implications for data collection and model evaluation. We show two assumptions under which the direct causes can be discovered from data, one of which further simplifies the discovery process. In addition to providing sound and complete algorithms, we propose an optimization technique based on an independence rule that can be integrated with the algorithms to speed up the discovery process both theoretically and empirically.</description>

Abstract: The existing algorithms for identification of neurons responsible for undesired and harmful behaviors do not consider the effects of confounders such as topic of the conversation. In this work, we show that confounders can create spurious correlations and propose a new causal mediation approach that controls the impact of the topic. In experiments with two large language models, we study the localization hypothesis and show that adjusting for the effect of conversation topic, toxicity becomes less localized.</description>

      <title>MLD-EA: Check and Complete Narrative Coherence by Introducing Emotions and Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrative understanding and story generation are critical challenges in natural language processing (NLP), with much of the existing research focused on summarization and question-answering tasks. While previous studies have explored predicting plot endings and generating extended narratives, they often neglect the logical coherence within stories, leaving a significant gap in the field. To address this, we introduce the Missing Logic Detector by Emotion and Action (MLD-EA) model, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify narrative gaps and generate coherent sentences that integrate seamlessly with the story's emotional and logical flow. The experimental results demonstrate that the MLD-EA model enhances narrative understanding and story generation, highlighting LLMs' potential as effective logic checkers in story writing with logical coherence and emotional consistency. This work fills a gap in NLP research and advances border goals of creating more sophisticated and reliable story-generation systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trust in Large Language Models with Uncertainty-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing with their impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, these models are sometimes prone to generating credible-sounding but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as LLM hallucinations. Reliable uncertainty estimation in LLMs is essential for fostering trust in their generated responses and serves as a critical tool for the detection and prevention of erroneous or hallucinated outputs. To achieve reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in open-ended and free-form natural language generation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach for LLMs. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates without compromising accuracy, thereby guiding them to produce more trustworthy responses. We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware causal language modeling loss function, grounded in the principles of decision theory. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple free-form question-answering datasets and models, we demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach yields better calibrated uncertainty estimates in natural language generation tasks than fine-tuning with the standard causal language modeling loss. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the model's ability to detect hallucinations and identify out-of-domain prompts.</description>

      <title>Does Few-Shot Learning Help LLM Performance in Code Synthesis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides at code generation through improved model design, training, and chain-of-thought. However, prompt-level optimizations remain an important yet under-explored aspect of LLMs for coding. This work focuses on the few-shot examples present in most code generation prompts, offering a systematic study on whether few-shot examples improve LLM's coding capabilities, which few-shot examples have the largest impact, and how to select impactful examples. Our work offers 2 approaches for selecting few-shot examples, a model-free method, CODEEXEMPLAR-FREE, and a model-based method, CODEEXEMPLAR-BASED. The 2 methods offer a trade-off between improved performance and reliance on training data and interpretability. Both methods significantly improve CodeLlama's coding ability across the popular HumanEval+ coding benchmark. In summary, our work provides valuable insights into how to pick few-shot examples in code generation prompts to improve LLM code generation capabilities.</description>

      <title>ShapeWords: Guiding Text-to-Image Synthesis with 3D Shape-Aware Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ShapeWords, an approach for synthesizing images based on 3D shape guidance and text prompts. ShapeWords incorporates target 3D shape information within specialized tokens embedded together with the input text, effectively blending 3D shape awareness with textual context to guide the image synthesis process. Unlike conventional shape guidance methods that rely on depth maps restricted to fixed viewpoints and often overlook full 3D structure or textual context, ShapeWords generates diverse yet consistent images that reflect both the target shape's geometry and the textual description. Experimental results show that ShapeWords produces images that are more text-compliant, aesthetically plausible, while also maintaining 3D shape awareness.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Transformers: Efficient Attention Mechanism for Tensor Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their extension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic cost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Panoptic Diffusion Models: co-generation of images and segmentation maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion models cannot simultaneously generate a segmentation map of objects and a corresponding image from the prompt. Previous attempts either generate segmentation maps based on the images or provide maps as input conditions to control image generation, limiting their functionality to given inputs. Incorporating an inherent understanding of the scene layouts can improve the creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer with a pretrained backbone. To facilitate co-generation with fewer sampling steps, we incorporate a fast diffusion solver into PDM. Additionally, when ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.</description>

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) has demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of imitation tasks. In this paper, we introduce an IRL framework designed to extract rewarding features from expert trajectories affected by delayed disturbances. Instead of relying on direct observations, our approach employs an efficient off-policy adversarial training framework to derive expert features and recover optimal policies from augmented delayed observations. Empirical evaluations in the MuJoCo environment under diverse delay settings validate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis showing that recovering expert policies from augmented delayed observations outperforms using direct delayed observations.</description>

Abstract: We present a neural network verification toolbox to 1) assess the probability of satisfaction of a constraint, and 2) synthesize a set expansion factor to achieve the probability of satisfaction. Specifically, the tool box establishes with a user-specified level of confidence whether the output of the neural network for a given input distribution is likely to be contained within a given set. Should the tool determine that the given set cannot satisfy the likelihood constraint, the tool also implements an approach outlined in this paper to alter the constraint set to ensure that the user-defined satisfaction probability is achieved. The toolbox is comprised of sampling-based approaches which exploit the properties of signed distance function to define set containment.</description>

      <title>Who Brings the Frisbee: Probing Hidden Hallucination Factors in Large Vision-Language Model via Causality Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLM) have significantly enhanced their ability to comprehend visual inputs alongside natural language. However, a major challenge in their real-world application is hallucination, where LVLMs generate non-existent visual elements, eroding user trust. The underlying mechanism driving this multimodal hallucination is poorly understood. Minimal research has illuminated whether contexts such as sky, tree, or grass field involve the LVLM in hallucinating a frisbee. We hypothesize that hidden factors, such as objects, contexts, and semantic foreground-background structures, induce hallucination. This study proposes a novel causal approach: a hallucination probing system to identify these hidden factors. By analyzing the causality between images, text prompts, and network saliency, we systematically explore interventions to block these factors. Our experimental findings show that a straightforward technique based on our analysis can significantly reduce hallucinations. Additionally, our analyses indicate the potential to edit network internals to minimize hallucinated outputs.</description>

      <title>3D Interaction Geometric Pre-training for Molecular Relational Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on understanding the interaction dynamics between molecules, which is crucial for applications ranging from catalyst engineering to drug discovery. Despite recent progress, earlier MRL approaches are limited to using only the 2D topological structure of molecules, as obtaining the 3D interaction geometry remains prohibitively expensive. This paper introduces a novel 3D geometric pre-training strategy for MRL (3DMRL) that incorporates a 3D virtual interaction environment, overcoming the limitations of costly traditional quantum mechanical calculation methods. With the constructed 3D virtual interaction environment, 3DMRL trains 2D MRL model to learn the overall 3D geometric information of molecular interaction through contrastive learning. Moreover, fine-grained interaction between molecules is learned through force prediction loss, which is crucial in understanding the wide range of molecular interaction processes. Extensive experiments on various tasks using real-world datasets, including out-of-distribution and extrapolation scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DMRL, showing up to a 24.93\% improvement in performance across 40 tasks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical limitations of multi-layer Transformer</title>

Abstract: Transformers, especially the decoder-only variants, are the backbone of most modern large language models; yet we do not have much understanding of their expressive power except for the simple $1$-layer case.
  Due to the difficulty of analyzing multi-layer models, all previous work relies on unproven complexity conjectures to show limitations for multi-layer Transformers. In this work, we prove the first $\textit{unconditional}$ lower bound against multi-layer decoder-only transformers. For any constant $L$, we prove that any $L$-layer decoder-only transformer needs a polynomial model dimension ($n^{\Omega(1)}$) to perform sequential composition of $L$ functions over an input of $n$ tokens.
  As a consequence, our results give: (1) the first depth-width trade-off for multi-layer transformers, exhibiting that the $L$-step composition task is exponentially harder for $L$-layer models compared to $(L+1)$-layer ones; (2) an unconditional separation between encoder and decoder, exhibiting a hard task for decoders that can be solved by an exponentially shallower and smaller encoder; (3) a provable advantage of chain-of-thought, exhibiting a task that becomes exponentially easier with chain-of-thought.
  On the technical side, we propose the multi-party $\textit{autoregressive}$ $\textit{communication}$ $\textit{model}$ that captures the computation of a decoder-only Transformer. We also introduce a new proof technique that finds a certain $\textit{indistinguishable}$ $\textit{decomposition}$ of all possible inputs iteratively for proving lower bounds in this model. We believe our new communication model and proof technique will be helpful to further understand the computational power of transformers.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Effects of Quality, Diversity, and Complexity in Synthetic Data From Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm for augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this variety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are scarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what bottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of synthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity, and complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in open-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream models. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model generalization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize the existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the downstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various components in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This examination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation algorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on data QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance of balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and self-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data, often there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity which impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are currently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting output diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that balancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future self-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in this direction.</description>

      <title>Human Multi-View Synthesis from a Single-View Model:Transferred Body and Face Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating multi-view human images from a single view is a complex and significant challenge. Although recent advancements in multi-view object generation have shown impressive results with diffusion models, novel view synthesis for humans remains constrained by the limited availability of 3D human datasets. Consequently, many existing models struggle to produce realistic human body shapes or capture fine-grained facial details accurately. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework that leverages transferred body and facial representations for multi-view human synthesis. Specifically, we use a single-view model pretrained on a large-scale human dataset to develop a multi-view body representation, aiming to extend the 2D knowledge of the single-view model to a multi-view diffusion model. Additionally, to enhance the model's detail restoration capability, we integrate transferred multimodal facial features into our trained human diffusion model. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in multi-view human synthesis.</description>

      <title>PEMF-VVTO: Point-Enhanced Video Virtual Try-on via Mask-free Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Virtual Try-on aims to fluently transfer the garment image to a semantically aligned try-on area in the source person video. Previous methods leveraged the inpainting mask to remove the original garment in the source video, thus achieving accurate garment transfer on simple model videos. However, when these methods are applied to realistic video data with more complex scene changes and posture movements, the overly large and incoherent agnostic masks will destroy the essential spatial-temporal information of the original video, thereby inhibiting the fidelity and coherence of the try-on video. To alleviate this problem, %avoid the inherent deficiencies of mask-based try-on paradigm, we propose a novel point-enhanced mask-free video virtual try-on framework (PEMF-VVTO). Specifically, we first leverage the pre-trained mask-based try-on model to construct large-scale paired training data (pseudo-person samples). Training on these mask-free data enables our model to perceive the original spatial-temporal information while realizing accurate garment transfer. Then, based on the pre-acquired sparse frame-cloth and frame-frame point alignments, we design the point-enhanced spatial attention (PSA) and point-enhanced temporal attention (PTA) to further improve the try-on accuracy and video coherence of the mask-free model. Concretely, PSA explicitly guides the garment transfer to desirable locations through the sparse semantic alignments of video frames and cloth. PTA exploits the temporal attention on sparse point correspondences to enhance the smoothness of generated videos. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments clearly illustrate that our PEMF-VVTO can generate more natural and coherent try-on videos than existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MILLION: A General Multi-Objective Framework with Controllable Risk for Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio management is an important yet challenging task in AI for FinTech, which aims to allocate investors' budgets among different assets to balance the risk and return of an investment. In this study, we propose a general Multi-objectIve framework with controLLable rIsk for pOrtfolio maNagement (MILLION), which consists of two main phases, i.e., return-related maximization and risk control. Specifically, in the return-related maximization phase, we introduce two auxiliary objectives, i.e., return rate prediction, and return rate ranking, combined with portfolio optimization to remit the overfitting problem and improve the generalization of the trained model to future markets. Subsequently, in the risk control phase, we propose two methods, i.e., portfolio interpolation and portfolio improvement, to achieve fine-grained risk control and fast risk adaption to a user-specified risk level. For the portfolio interpolation method, we theoretically prove that the risk can be perfectly controlled if the to-be-set risk level is in a proper interval. In addition, we also show that the return rate of the adjusted portfolio after portfolio interpolation is no less than that of the min-variance optimization, as long as the model in the reward maximization phase is effective. Furthermore, the portfolio improvement method can achieve greater return rates while keeping the same risk level compared to portfolio interpolation. Extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>MRNet: Multifaceted Resilient Networks for Medical Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Multifaceted Resilient Network(MRNet), a novel architecture developed for medical image-to-image translation that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MRI-to-CT and MRI-to-MRI conversion. MRNet leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to exploit frequency-based features to build a powerful method for advanced medical image transformation. The architecture extracts comprehensive multiscale features from diverse datasets using a powerful SAM image encoder and performs resolution-aware feature fusion that consistently integrates U-Net encoder outputs with SAM-derived features. This fusion optimizes the traditional U-Net skip connection while leveraging transformer-based contextual analysis. The translation is complemented by an innovative dual-mask configuration incorporating dynamic attention patterns and a specialized loss function designed to address regional mapping mismatches, preserving both the gross anatomy and tissue details. Extensive validation studies have shown that MRNet outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, particularly in maintaining anatomical fidelity and minimizing translation artifacts.</description>

      <title>Less is More: A Stealthy and Efficient Adversarial Attack Method for DRL-based Autonomous Driving Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based autonomous driving policies, these policies still exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This vulnerability poses a formidable challenge to the practical deployment of these policies in autonomous driving. Designing effective adversarial attacks is an indispensable prerequisite for enhancing the robustness of these policies. In view of this, we present a novel stealthy and efficient adversarial attack method for DRL-based autonomous driving policies. Specifically, we introduce a DRL-based adversary designed to trigger safety violations (e.g., collisions) by injecting adversarial samples at critical moments. We model the attack as a mixed-integer optimization problem and formulate it as a Markov decision process. Then, we train the adversary to learn the optimal policy for attacking at critical moments without domain knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce attack-related information and a trajectory clipping method to enhance the learning capability of the adversary. Finally, we validate our method in an unprotected left-turn scenario across different traffic densities. The experimental results show that our method achieves more than 90% collision rate within three attacks in most cases. Furthermore, our method achieves more than 130% improvement in attack efficiency compared to the unlimited attack method.</description>

      <title>Point-GN: A Non-Parametric Network Using Gaussian Positional Encoding for Point Cloud Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time environments.</description>

      <title>UTSD: Unified Time Series Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have achieved unprecedented success in time series analysis. However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling, existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization ability. After training from scratch, UTSD achieves comparable performance against domain-specific proprietary models. The empirical results validate the potential of UTSD as a time series foundational model.</description>

      <title>TokenFlow: Unified Image Tokenizer for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TokenFlow, a novel unified image tokenizer that bridges the long-standing gap between multimodal understanding and generation. Prior research attempt to employ a single reconstruction-targeted Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder for unifying these two tasks. We observe that understanding and generation require fundamentally different granularities of visual information. This leads to a critical trade-off, particularly compromising performance in multimodal understanding tasks. TokenFlow addresses this challenge through an innovative dual-codebook architecture that decouples semantic and pixel-level feature learning while maintaining their alignment via a shared mapping mechanism. This design enables direct access to both high-level semantic representations crucial for understanding tasks and fine-grained visual features essential for generation through shared indices. Our extensive experiments demonstrate TokenFlow's superiority across multiple dimensions. Leveraging TokenFlow, we demonstrate for the first time that discrete visual input can surpass LLaVA-1.5 13B in understanding performance, achieving a 7.2\% average improvement. For image reconstruction, we achieve a strong FID score of 0.63 at 384*384 resolution. Moreover, TokenFlow establishes state-of-the-art performance in autoregressive image generation with a GenEval score of 0.55 at 256*256 resolution, achieving comparable results to SDXL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Access Point Coordination (MAPC) and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are expected to be key features in future Wi-Fi, such as the forthcoming IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8) and beyond. In this paper, we explore a coordinated solution based on online learning to drive the optimization of Spatial Reuse (SR), a method that allows multiple devices to perform simultaneous transmissions by controlling interference through Packet Detect (PD) adjustment and transmit power control. In particular, we focus on a Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit (MA-MAB) setting, where multiple decision-making agents concurrently configure SR parameters from coexisting networks by leveraging the MAPC framework, and study various algorithms and reward-sharing mechanisms. We evaluate different MA-MAB implementations using Komondor, a well-adopted Wi-Fi simulator, and demonstrate that AI-native SR enabled by coordinated MABs can improve the network performance over current Wi-Fi operation: mean throughput increases by 15%, fairness is improved by increasing the minimum throughput across the network by 210%, while the maximum access delay is kept below 3 ms.</description>

      <title>Revolve: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how "R"esponses "EVOLVE" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. These advantages highlight its adaptability and efficiency, positioning REVOLVE as a valuable tool for optimizing LLM-based systems and accelerating the development of next-generation AI technologies.

      <title>Fine-Grained Behavior Simulation with Role-Playing Large Language Model on Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing tasks. However, there is limited research on whether LLMs can accurately simulate user behavior in real-world scenarios, such as social media. This requires models to effectively analyze a user's history and simulate their role. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{FineRob}, a novel fine-grained behavior simulation dataset. We collect the complete behavioral history of 1,866 distinct users across three social media platforms. Each behavior is decomposed into three fine-grained elements: object, type, and content, resulting in 78.6k QA records. Based on FineRob, we identify two dominant reasoning patterns in LLMs' behavior simulation processes and propose the \textbf{OM-CoT} fine-tuning method to enhance the capability. Through comprehensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key factors of behavior simulation and also demonstrate the effectiveness of OM-CoT approach\footnote{Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/linkseed18612254945/FineRob}}</description>

These metrics are typically assessed by their correlation with human judgments, which captures the monotonic relationship between human and metric scores. However, we argue that it is equally important to ensure that metrics treat all systems fairly and consistently. In this paper, we introduce a method to evaluate this aspect.</description>

      <title>Testing Neural Network Verifiers: A Soundness Benchmark with Hidden Counterexamples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, many neural network (NN) verifiers have been developed to formally verify certain properties of neural networks such as robustness. Although many benchmarks have been constructed to evaluate the performance of NN verifiers, they typically lack a ground-truth for hard instances where no current verifier can verify and no counterexample can be found, which makes it difficult to check the soundness of a new verifier if it claims to verify hard instances which no other verifier can do. We propose to develop a soundness benchmark for NN verification. Our benchmark contains instances with deliberately inserted counterexamples while we also try to hide the counterexamples from regular adversarial attacks which can be used for finding counterexamples. We design a training method to produce neural networks with such hidden counterexamples. Our benchmark aims to be used for testing the soundness of NN verifiers and identifying falsely claimed verifiability when it is known that hidden counterexamples exist. We systematically construct our benchmark and generate instances across diverse model architectures, activation functions, input sizes, and perturbation radii. We demonstrate that our benchmark successfully identifies bugs in state-of-the-art NN verifiers, as well as synthetic bugs, providing a crucial step toward enhancing the reliability of testing NN verifiers. Our code is available at https://github.com/MVP-Harry/SoundnessBench and our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SoundnessBench/SoundnessBench.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks for Solving PDE Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of PDE-based inverse problems without labeled training data. We extend the stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the inverse problems without the need for labeled data.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Dense Visual Predictions Through Multi-Task Coherence and Prioritization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) involves the concurrent training of multiple tasks, offering notable advantages for dense prediction tasks in computer vision. MTL not only reduces training and inference time as opposed to having multiple single-task models, but also enhances task accuracy through the interaction of multiple tasks. However, existing methods face limitations. They often rely on suboptimal cross-task interactions, resulting in task-specific predictions with poor geometric and predictive coherence. In addition, many approaches use inadequate loss weighting strategies, which do not address the inherent variability in task evolution during training. To overcome these challenges, we propose an advanced MTL model specifically designed for dense vision tasks. Our model leverages state-of-the-art vision transformers with task-specific decoders. To enhance cross-task coherence, we introduce a trace-back method that improves both cross-task geometric and predictive features. Furthermore, we present a novel dynamic task balancing approach that projects task losses onto a common scale and prioritizes more challenging tasks during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across two benchmark datasets.

      <title>Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</description>

      <title>U-MATH: A University-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Skills in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current evaluation of mathematical skills in LLMs is limited, as existing benchmarks are either relatively small, primarily focus on elementary and high-school problems, or lack diversity in topics. Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.
  To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.
  The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.</description>

      <title>ClusterKV: Manipulating LLM KV Cache in Semantic Space for Recallable Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, and the context length is rapidly increasing to handle tasks such as long-document QA and complex logical reasoning. However, long context poses significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory costs of key-value (KV) cache and increased latency due to extensive memory accesses. Recent works have proposed compressing KV cache to approximate computation, but these methods either evict tokens permanently, never recalling them for later inference, or recall previous tokens at the granularity of pages divided by textual positions. Both approaches degrade the model accuracy and output quality. To achieve efficient and accurate recallable KV cache compression, we introduce ClusterKV, which recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters. We design and implement efficient algorithms and systems for clustering, selection, indexing and caching. Experiment results show that ClusterKV attains negligible accuracy loss across various tasks with 32k context lengths, using only a 1k to 2k KV cache budget, and achieves up to a 2$\times$ speedup in latency and a 2.5$\times$ improvement in decoding throughput. Compared to SoTA recallable KV compression methods, ClusterKV demonstrates higher model accuracy and output quality, while maintaining or exceeding inference efficiency.</description>

      <title>Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural Prompts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.</description>

      <title>AIM: Adaptive Inference of Multi-Modal LLMs via Token Merging and Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that, our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, under a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code will be available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, there is a pressing need for easily accessible early screening methods. Typically, this requires medical practitioners to investigate heart auscultations for irregular sounds, followed by echocardiography and electrocardiography tests. To democratize early diagnosis, we present a user-friendly solution for abnormal heart sound detection, utilizing mobile phones and a lightweight neural network optimized for on-device inference. Unlike previous approaches reliant on specialized stethoscopes, our method directly analyzes audio recordings, facilitated by a novel architecture known as IConNet. IConNet, an Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network, harnesses insights from audio signal processing, enhancing efficiency and providing transparency in neural pattern extraction from raw waveform signals. This is a significant step towards trustworthy AI in healthcare, aiding in remote health monitoring efforts.</description>

      <title>Intent-driven In-context Learning for Few-shot Dialogue State Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue state tracking (DST) plays an essential role in task-oriented dialogue systems. However, user's input may contain implicit information, posing significant challenges for DST tasks. Additionally, DST data includes complex information, which not only contains a large amount of noise unrelated to the current turn, but also makes constructing DST datasets expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce Intent-driven In-context Learning for Few-shot DST (IDIC-DST). By extracting user's intent, we propose an Intent-driven Dialogue Information Augmentation module to augment the dialogue information, which can track dialogue states more effectively. Moreover, we mask noisy information from DST data and rewrite user's input in the Intent-driven Examples Retrieval module, where we retrieve similar examples. We then utilize a pre-trained large language model to update the dialogue state using the augmented dialogue information and examples. Experimental results demonstrate that IDIC-DST achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings on MultiWOZ 2.1 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Forgery Attacks on Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks, such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading, represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However, our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models, even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT), to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically, we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall, our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Path-Guided Particle-based Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-based Bayesian inference methods by sampling from a partition-free target (posterior) distribution, e.g., Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), have attracted significant attention. We propose a path-guided particle-based sampling~(PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage (LwS) density path linking an initial distribution to the target distribution. We propose to utilize a Neural network to learn a vector field motivated by the Fokker-Planck equation of the designed density path. Particles, initiated from the initial distribution, evolve according to the ordinary differential equation defined by the vector field. The distribution of these particles is guided along a density path from the initial distribution to the target distribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient search of modes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically analyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated samples and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization errors. Practically, the proposed PGPS-LwS method demonstrates higher Bayesian inference accuracy and better calibration ability in experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world Bayesian learning tasks, compared to baselines, such as SVGD and Langevin dynamics, etc.</description>

      <title>LuxEmbedder: A Cross-Lingual Approach to Enhanced Luxembourgish Sentence Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentence embedding models play a key role in various Natural Language Processing tasks, such as in Topic Modeling, Document Clustering and Recommendation Systems. However, these models rely heavily on parallel data, which can be scarce for many low-resource languages, including Luxembourgish. This scarcity results in suboptimal performance of monolingual and cross-lingual sentence embedding models for these languages. To address this issue, we compile a relatively small but high-quality human-generated cross-lingual parallel dataset to train \tool, an enhanced sentence embedding model for Luxembourgish with strong cross-lingual capabilities. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that including low-resource languages in parallel training datasets can be more advantageous for other low-resource languages than relying solely on high-resource language pairs. Furthermore, recognizing the lack of sentence embedding benchmarks for low-resource languages, we create a paraphrase detection benchmark specifically for Luxembourgish, aiming to partially fill this gap and promote further research.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Day-to-Day Route Choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding travelers' route choices can help policymakers devise optimal operational and planning strategies for both normal and abnormal circumstances. However, existing choice modeling methods often rely on predefined assumptions and struggle to capture the dynamic and adaptive nature of travel behavior. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating remarkable ability to replicate human-like behaviors across various fields. Despite this potential, their capacity to accurately simulate human route choice behavior in transportation contexts remains doubtful. To satisfy this curiosity, this paper investigates the potential of LLMs for route choice modeling by introducing an LLM-empowered agent, "LLMTraveler." This agent integrates an LLM as its core, equipped with a memory system that learns from past experiences and makes decisions by balancing retrieved data and personality traits. The study systematically evaluates the LLMTraveler's ability to replicate human-like decision-making through two stages: (1) analyzing its route-switching behavior in single origin-destination (OD) pair congestion game scenarios, where it demonstrates patterns align with laboratory data but are not fully explained by traditional models, and (2) testing its capacity to model day-to-day (DTD) adaptive learning behaviors on the Ortuzar and Willumsen (OW) network, producing results comparable to Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models. These experiments demonstrate that the framework can partially replicate human-like decision-making in route choice while providing natural language explanations for its decisions. This capability offers valuable insights for transportation policymaking, such as simulating traveler responses to new policies or changes in the network.</description>

      <title>Improving Linguistic Diversity of Large Language Models with Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in replicating human-like abilities, there are concerns about a reduction in the linguistic diversity of their outputs. This results in the homogenization of viewpoints and perspectives, as well as the underrepresentation of specific demographic groups. Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have been suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks or come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency. This makes them challenging to apply to applications that demand very low latency, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. We propose Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a task-agnostic framework that enhances the text diversity of LLMs without increasing latency or computational cost. Given the same prompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple diverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number. Experiments on dialogue and story generation tasks demonstrate that PEFT significantly enhances the diversity of LLM outputs, as evidenced by lower similarity between candidate responses. Since PEFT emphasizes semantic diversity over lexical diversity, it can also notably reduce demographic bias in dialogue systems. The implementations and datasets are available in our repository: https://github.com/mailong25/peft_diversity</description>

      <title>DIVE: Taming DINO for Subject-Driven Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the success of diffusion models in image generation and editing, video editing has recently gained substantial attention. However, maintaining temporal consistency and motion alignment still remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes DINO-guided Video Editing (DIVE), a framework designed to facilitate subject-driven editing in source videos conditioned on either target text prompts or reference images with specific identities. The core of DIVE lies in leveraging the powerful semantic features extracted from a pretrained DINOv2 model as implicit correspondences to guide the editing process. Specifically, to ensure temporal motion consistency, DIVE employs DINO features to align with the motion trajectory of the source video. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world videos demonstrate that our framework can achieve high-quality editing results with robust motion consistency, highlighting the potential of DINO to contribute to video editing. For precise subject editing, DIVE incorporates the DINO features of reference images into a pretrained text-to-image model to learn Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs), effectively registering the target subject's identity.

      <title>Intuitive Axial Augmentation Using Polar-Sine-Based Piecewise Distortion for Medical Slice-Wise Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most data-driven models for medical image analysis rely on universal augmentations to improve performance. Experimental evidence has confirmed their effectiveness, but the unclear mechanism underlying them poses a barrier to the widespread acceptance and trust in such methods within the medical community. We revisit and acknowledge the unique characteristics of medical images apart from traditional digital images, and consequently, proposed a medical-specific augmentation algorithm that is more elastic and aligns well with radiology scan procedure. The method performs piecewise affine with sinusoidal distorted ray according to radius on polar coordinates, thus simulating uncertain postures of human lying flat on the scanning table. Our method could generate human visceral distribution without affecting the fundamental relative position on axial plane. Two non-adaptive algorithms, namely Meta-based Scan Table Removal and Similarity-Guided Parameter Search, are introduced to bolster robustness of our augmentation method. Experiments show our method improves accuracy across multiple famous segmentation frameworks without requiring more data samples. Our preview code is available in: https://github.com/MGAMZ/PSBPD.</description>

      <title>DiffStyleTTS: Diffusion-based Hierarchical Prosody Modeling for Text-to-Speech with Diverse and Controllable Styles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human speech exhibits rich and flexible prosodic variations. To address the one-to-many mapping problem from text to prosody in a reasonable and flexible manner, we propose DiffStyleTTS, a multi-speaker acoustic model based on a conditional diffusion module and an improved classifier-free guidance, which hierarchically models speech prosodic features, and controls different prosodic styles to guide prosody prediction. Experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines in naturalness and achieves superior synthesis speed compared to three diffusion-based baselines. Additionally, by adjusting the guiding scale, DiffStyleTTS effectively controls the guidance intensity of the synthetic prosody.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Supply Chain Visibility with Generative AI: An Exploratory Case Study on Relationship Prediction in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key stumbling block in effective supply chain risk management for companies and policymakers is a lack of visibility on interdependent supply network relationships. Relationship prediction, also called link prediction is an emergent area of supply chain surveillance research that aims to increase the visibility of supply chains using data-driven techniques. Existing methods have been successful for predicting relationships but struggle to extract the context in which these relationships are embedded - such as the products being supplied or locations they are supplied from. Lack of context prevents practitioners from distinguishing transactional relations from established supply chain relations, hindering accurate estimations of risk. In this work, we develop a new Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) enhanced machine learning framework that leverages pre-trained language models as embedding models combined with machine learning models to predict supply chain relationships within knowledge graphs. By integrating Generative AI techniques, our approach captures the nuanced semantic relationships between entities, thereby improving supply chain visibility and facilitating more precise risk management. Using data from a real case study, we show that GenAI-enhanced link prediction surpasses all benchmarks, and demonstrate how GenAI models can be explored and effectively used in supply chain risk management.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Pretrained Attention-based Models for Real-Time Recognition in Robot-Assisted Esophagectomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Esophageal cancer is among the most common types of cancer worldwide. It is traditionally treated using open esophagectomy, but in recent years, robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) has emerged as a promising alternative. However, robot-assisted surgery can be challenging for novice surgeons, as they often suffer from a loss of spatial orientation. Computer-aided anatomy recognition holds promise for improving surgical navigation, but research in this area remains limited. In this study, we developed a comprehensive dataset for semantic segmentation in RAMIE, featuring the largest collection of vital anatomical structures and surgical instruments to date. Handling this diverse set of classes presents challenges, including class imbalance and the recognition of complex structures such as nerves. This study aims to understand the challenges and limitations of current state-of-the-art algorithms on this novel dataset and problem. Therefore, we benchmarked eight real-time deep learning models using two pretraining datasets. We assessed both traditional and attention-based networks, hypothesizing that attention-based networks better capture global patterns and address challenges such as occlusion caused by blood or other tissues. The benchmark includes our RAMIE dataset and the publicly available CholecSeg8k dataset, enabling a thorough assessment of surgical segmentation tasks. Our findings indicate that pretraining on ADE20k, a dataset for semantic segmentation, is more effective than pretraining on ImageNet. Furthermore, attention-based models outperform traditional convolutional neural networks, with SegNeXt and Mask2Former achieving higher Dice scores, and Mask2Former additionally excelling in average symmetric surface distance.</description>

      <title>Learning Semantic Association Rules from Internet of Things Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) is the task of discovering commonalities in data in the form of logical implications. ARM is used in the Internet of Things (IoT) for different tasks including monitoring and decision-making. However, existing methods give limited consideration to IoT-specific requirements such as heterogeneity and volume. Furthermore, they do not utilize important static domain-specific description data about IoT systems, which is increasingly represented as knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel ARM pipeline for IoT data that utilizes both dynamic sensor data and static IoT system metadata. Furthermore, we propose an Autoencoder-based Neurosymbolic ARM method (Aerial) as part of the pipeline to address the high volume of IoT data and reduce the total number of rules that are resource-intensive to process. Aerial learns a neural representation of a given data and extracts association rules from this representation by exploiting the reconstruction (decoding) mechanism of an autoencoder. Extensive evaluations on 3 IoT datasets from 2 domains show that ARM on both static and dynamic IoT data results in more generically applicable rules while Aerial can learn a more concise set of high-quality association rules than the state-of-the-art with full coverage over the datasets.</description>

      <title>Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising popularity of the microservice architectural style has led to a growing demand for automated testing approaches tailored to these systems. EvoMaster is a state-of-the-art tool that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to automatically generate test cases for microservices' REST APIs. One limitation of these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch distances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively capture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level testing. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH) that uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation process. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by learning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different microservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation of the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case based on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically evaluate MISH's effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice applications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for testing REST APIs. Our evaluation shows promising results for using MISH to guide the automated test case generation within EvoMaster.</description>

      <title>Tango*: Constrained synthesis planning using chemically informed value functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has made significant strides in generating retrosynthetic pathways for simple molecules in a non-constrained fashion. Recent work introduces a specialised bidirectional search algorithm with forward and retro expansion to address the starting material-constrained synthesis problem, allowing CASP systems to provide synthesis pathways from specified starting materials, such as waste products or renewable feed-stocks. In this work, we introduce a simple guided search which allows solving the starting material-constrained synthesis planning problem using an existing, uni-directional search algorithm, Retro*. We show that by optimising a single hyperparameter, Tango* outperforms existing methods in terms of efficiency and solve rate. We find the Tango* cost function catalyses strong improvements for the bidirectional DESP methods. Our method also achieves lower wall clock times while proposing synthetic routes of similar length, a common metric for route quality. Finally, we highlight potential reasons for the strong performance of Tango over neural guided search methods</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm Based System for Path Planning with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Swarms in Cell-Grid Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path Planning methods for autonomously controlling swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining momentum due to their operational advantages. An increasing number of scenarios now require autonomous control of multiple UAVs, as autonomous operation can significantly reduce labor costs. Additionally, obtaining optimal flight paths can lower energy consumption, thereby extending battery life for other critical operations. Many of these scenarios, however, involve obstacles such as power lines and trees, which complicate Path Planning. This paper presents an evolutionary computation-based system employing genetic algorithms to address this problem in environments with obstacles. The proposed approach aims to ensure complete coverage of areas with fixed obstacles, such as in field exploration tasks, while minimizing flight time regardless of map size or the number of UAVs in the swarm. No specific goal points or prior information beyond the provided map is required. The experiments conducted in this study used five maps of varying sizes and obstacle densities, as well as a control map without obstacles, with different numbers of UAVs. The results demonstrate that this method can determine optimal paths for all UAVs during full map traversal, thus minimizing resource consumption. A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art approach is presented to highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces BIMCaP, a novel method to integrate mobile 3D sparse LiDAR data and camera measurements with pre-existing building information models (BIMs), enhancing fast and accurate indoor mapping with affordable sensors. BIMCaP refines sensor poses by leveraging a 3D BIM and employing a bundle adjustment technique to align real-world measurements with the model. Experiments using real-world open-access data show that BIMCaP achieves superior accuracy, reducing translational error by over 4 cm compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This advancement enhances the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of 3D mapping methodologies like SLAM. BIMCaP's improvements benefit various fields, including construction site management and emergency response, by providing up-to-date, aligned digital maps for better decision-making and productivity.

      <title>PBP: Post-training Backdoor Purification for Malware Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rise of machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity has brought new challenges, including the increasing threat of backdoor poisoning attacks on ML malware classifiers. For instance, adversaries could inject malicious samples into public malware repositories, contaminating the training data and potentially misclassifying malware by the ML model. Current countermeasures predominantly focus on detecting poisoned samples by leveraging disagreements within the outputs of a diverse set of ensemble models on training data points. However, these methods are not suitable for scenarios where Machine Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) is used or when users aim to remove backdoors from a model after it has been trained. Addressing this scenario, we introduce PBP, a post-training defense for malware classifiers that mitigates various types of backdoor embeddings without assuming any specific backdoor embedding mechanism. Our method exploits the influence of backdoor attacks on the activation distribution of neural networks, independent of the trigger-embedding method. In the presence of a backdoor attack, the activation distribution of each layer is distorted into a mixture of distributions. By regulating the statistics of the batch normalization layers, we can guide a backdoored model to perform similarly to a clean one. Our method demonstrates substantial advantages over several state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by experiments on two datasets, two types of backdoor methods, and various attack configurations. Notably, our approach requires only a small portion of the training data -- only 1\% -- to purify the backdoor and reduce the attack success rate from 100\% to almost 0\%, a 100-fold improvement over the baseline methods. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/judydnguyen/pbp-backdoor-purification-official}.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Mitigation of Language Reasoning Degradation After Multimodal Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models typically combine a powerful large language model (LLM) with a vision encoder and are then trained on multimodal data via instruction tuning. While this process adapts LLMs to multimodal settings, it remains unclear whether this adaptation compromises their original language reasoning capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of multimodal instruction tuning on language reasoning performance. We focus on LLaVA, a leading multimodal framework that integrates LLMs such as Vicuna or Mistral with the CLIP vision encoder. We compare the performance of the original LLMs with their multimodal-adapted counterparts across eight language reasoning tasks. Our experiments yield several key insights. First, the impact of multimodal learning varies between Vicuna and Mistral: we observe a degradation in language reasoning for Mistral but improvements for Vicuna across most tasks. Second, while multimodal instruction learning consistently degrades performance on mathematical reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K), it enhances performance on commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA). Finally, we demonstrate that a training-free model merging technique can effectively mitigate the language reasoning degradation observed in multimodal-adapted Mistral and even improve performance on visual tasks.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching with General Discrete Paths: A Kinetic-Optimal Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design space of discrete-space diffusion or flow generative models are significantly less well-understood than their continuous-space counterparts, with many works focusing only on a simple masked construction. In this work, we aim to take a holistic approach to the construction of discrete generative models based on continuous-time Markov chains, and for the first time, allow the use of arbitrary discrete probability paths, or colloquially, corruption processes. Through the lens of optimizing the symmetric kinetic energy, we propose velocity formulas that can be applied to any given probability path, completely decoupling the probability and velocity, and giving the user the freedom to specify any desirable probability path based on expert knowledge specific to the data domain. Furthermore, we find that a special construction of mixture probability paths optimizes the symmetric kinetic energy for the discrete case. We empirically validate the usefulness of this new design space across multiple modalities: text generation, inorganic material generation, and image generation. We find that we can outperform the mask construction even in text with kinetic-optimal mixture paths, while we can make use of domain-specific constructions of the probability path over the visual domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gait recognition is a significant biometric technique for person identification, particularly in scenarios where other physiological biometrics are impractical or ineffective. In this paper, we address the challenges associated with gait recognition and present a novel approach to improve its accuracy and reliability. The proposed method leverages advanced techniques, including sequential gait landmarks obtained through the Mediapipe pose estimation model, Procrustes analysis for alignment, and a Siamese biGRU-dualStack Neural Network architecture for capturing temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments were conducted on large-scale cross-view datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, achieving high recognition accuracy compared to other models. The model demonstrated accuracies of 95.7%, 94.44%, 87.71%, and 86.6% on CASIA-B, SZU RGB-D, OU-MVLP, and Gait3D datasets respectively. The results highlight the potential applications of the proposed method in various practical domains, indicating its significant contribution to the field of gait recognition.</description>

      <title>Feed-Forward Bullet-Time Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes from Monocular Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in static feed-forward scene reconstruction have demonstrated significant progress in high-quality novel view synthesis. However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gender Bias Transfer between Pre-trained and Prompt-Adapted Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted to achieve task-specificity for deployment in real-world decision systems. Several previous works have investigated the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) by studying the effect of the fine-tuning adaptation strategy on model fairness to find that fairness in pre-trained masked language models have limited effect on the fairness of models when adapted using fine-tuning. In this work, we expand the study of BTH to causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an accessible, and compute-efficient way to deploy models in real-world systems. In contrast to previous works, we establish that intrinsic biases in pre-trained Mistral, Falcon and Llama models are strongly correlated (rho &gt;= 0.94) with biases when the same models are zero- and few-shot prompted, using a pronoun co-reference resolution task. Further, we find that bias transfer remains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit fair or biased behavior (rho &gt;= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical composition are varied (rho &gt;= 0.97). Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring fairness in pre-trained LLMs, especially when they are later used to perform downstream tasks via prompt adaptation.</description>

      <title>NODE-AdvGAN: Improving the transferability and perceptual similarity of adversarial examples by dynamic-system-driven adversarial generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding adversarial examples is crucial for improving the model's robustness, as they introduce imperceptible perturbations that deceive models. Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more robust models by removing their singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) for simulating the dynamics of the generator. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability in black-box attacks by effectively tuning noise parameters during training. Experiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more effective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while preserving better perceptual quality than traditional GAN-based methods.</description>

      <title>Perception Tokens Enhance Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Best-of-N Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.</description>

      <title>FLAIR: VLM with Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CLIP has shown impressive results in aligning images and texts at scale. However, its ability to capture detailed visual features remains limited because CLIP matches images and texts at a global level. To address this issue, we propose FLAIR, Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations, an approach that utilizes long and detailed image descriptions to learn localized image embeddings. By sampling diverse sub-captions that describe fine-grained details about an image, we train our vision-language model to produce not only global embeddings but also text-specific image representations. Our model introduces text-conditioned attention pooling on top of local image tokens to produce fine-grained image representations that excel at retrieving detailed image content. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both, existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks, as well as, our newly introduced fine-grained retrieval task which evaluates vision-language models' ability to retrieve partial image content. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAIR trained on 30M image-text pairs in capturing fine-grained visual information, including zero-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming models trained on billions of pairs.

      <description>arXiv:2412.03572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities. We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation systems.</description>

Abstract: Among numerous studies for driver state detection, wearable physiological measurements offer a practical method for real-time monitoring. However, there are few driver physiological datasets in open-road scenarios, and the existing datasets suffer from issues such as poor signal quality, small sample sizes, and short data collection periods. Therefore, in this paper, a large-scale multimodal driving dataset, OpenDriver, for driver state detection is developed. The OpenDriver encompasses a total of 3,278 driving trips, with a signal collection duration spanning approximately 4,600 hours. Two modalities of driving signals are enrolled in OpenDriver: electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and six-axis motion data of the steering wheel from a motion measurement unit (IMU), which were recorded from 81 drivers and their vehicles. Furthermore, three challenging tasks are involved in our work, namely ECG signal quality assessment, individual biometric identification based on ECG signals, and physiological signal analysis in complex driving environments. To facilitate research in these tasks, corresponding benchmarks have also been introduced. First, a noisy augmentation strategy is applied to generate a larger-scale ECG signal dataset with realistic noise simulation for quality assessment. Second, an end-to-end contrastive learning framework is employed for individual biometric identification. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of drivers' HRV features under different driving conditions is conducted. Each benchmark provides evaluation metrics and reference results. The OpenDriver dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/bdne/OpenDriver.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are not intrinsically neutral and biases trickle in any type of technological tool. In particular when dealing with people, the impact of AI algorithms' technical errors originating with mislabeled data is undeniable. As they feed wrong and discriminatory classifications, these systems are not systematically guarded against bias. In this article we consider the problem of bias in AI systems from the point of view of data quality dimensions. We highlight the limited model construction of bias mitigation tools based on accuracy strategy, illustrating potential improvements of a specific tool in gender classification errors occurring in two typically difficult contexts: the classification of non-binary individuals, for which the label set becomes incomplete with respect to the dataset; and the classification of transgender individuals, for which the dataset becomes inconsistent with respect to the label set. Using formal methods for reasoning about the behavior of the classification system in presence of a changing world, we propose to reconsider the fairness of the classification task in terms of completeness, consistency, timeliness and reliability, and offer some theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Inductive Meta-path Learning for Schema-complex Heterogeneous Information Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are information networks with multiple types of nodes and edges. The concept of meta-path, i.e., a sequence of entity types and relation types connecting two entities, is proposed to provide the meta-level explainable semantics for various HIN tasks. Traditionally, meta-paths are primarily used for schema-simple HINs, e.g., bibliographic networks with only a few entity types, where meta-paths are often enumerated with domain knowledge. However, the adoption of meta-paths for schema-complex HINs, such as knowledge bases (KBs) with hundreds of entity and relation types, has been limited due to the computational complexity associated with meta-path enumeration. Additionally, effectively assessing meta-paths requires enumerating relevant path instances, which adds further complexity to the meta-path learning process. To address these challenges, we propose SchemaWalk, an inductive meta-path learning framework for schema-complex HINs. We represent meta-paths with schema-level representations to support the learning of the scores of meta-paths for varying relations, mitigating the need of exhaustive path instance enumeration for each relation. Further, we design a reinforcement-learning based path-finding agent, which directly navigates the network schema (i.e., schema graph) to learn policies for establishing meta-paths with high coverage and confidence for multiple relations. Extensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm.</description>

Abstract: Although interest in synthetic medical data (SMD) for training and testing AI methods is growing, the absence of a standardized framework to evaluate its quality and applicability hinders its wider adoption. Here, we outline an evaluation framework designed to meet the unique requirements of medical applications, and introduce SMD Card, which can serve as comprehensive reports that accompany artificially generated datasets. This card provides a transparent and standardized framework for evaluating and reporting the quality of synthetic data, which can benefit SMD developers, users, and regulators, particularly for AI models using SMD in regulatory submissions.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Team: Zero-Shot Physical Task Planning with Visual LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19094v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Wonderful Team, a multi-agent Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) framework for executing high level robotic planning in a zero-shot regime. In our context, zero-shot high-level planning means that for a novel environment, we provide a VLLM with an image of the robot's surroundings and a task description, and the VLLM outputs the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Unlike previous methods for high-level visual planning for robotic manipulation, our method uses VLLMs for the entire planning process, enabling a more tightly integrated loop between perception, control, and planning. As a result, Wonderful Team's performance on a real-world semantic and physical planning tasks often exceeds methods that rely on separate vision systems. For example, we see an average 40% success-rate improvement on VimaBench over prior methods such as NLaP, an average 30% improvement over Trajectory Generators on tasks from the Trajectory Generator paper including drawing and wiping a plate, and an average 70% improvement over Trajectory Generators on a new set of semantic reasoning tasks including environment re-arrangement with implicit linguistic constraints. We hope these results highlight the rapid improvements of VLLMs in the past year, and motivate the community to consider VLLMs as an option for some high-level robotic planning problems in the future.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in clinical applications through prompt engineering, allowing flexible clinical predictions. However, they struggle to produce reliable prediction probabilities, which are crucial for transparency and decision-making. While explicit prompts can lead LLMs to generate probability estimates, their numerical reasoning limitations raise concerns about reliability. We compared explicit probabilities from text generation to implicit probabilities derived from the likelihood of predicting the correct label token. Across six advanced open-source LLMs and five medical datasets, explicit probabilities consistently underperformed implicit probabilities in discrimination, precision, and recall. This discrepancy is more pronounced with smaller LLMs and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation, improved probability estimation methods, and further research for clinical use of LLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores machine learning (ML) models for classifying lung cancer levels to improve diagnostic accuracy and prognosis. Through parameter tuning and rigorous evaluation, we assess various ML algorithms. Techniques like minimum child weight and learning rate monitoring were used to reduce overfitting and optimize performance. Our findings highlight the robust performance of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models across all phases. Ensemble methods, including voting and bagging, also showed promise in enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness. However, Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with the Sigmoid kernel faced challenges, indicating a need for further refinement. Overall, our study provides insights into ML-based lung cancer classification, emphasizing the importance of parameter tuning to optimize model performance and improve diagnostic accuracy in oncological care.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Guardrailing Large Language Models for Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development in large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing and understanding (NLP/NLU), offering significant benefits across various domains. However, when applied to scientific research, these powerful models exhibit critical failure modes related to scientific integrity and trustworthiness. Existing general-purpose LLM guardrails are insufficient to address these unique challenges in the scientific domain. We provide comprehensive guidelines for deploying LLM guardrails in the scientific domain. We identify specific challenges -- including time sensitivity, knowledge contextualization, conflict resolution, and intellectual property concerns -- and propose a guideline framework for the guardrails that can align with scientific needs. These guardrail dimensions include trustworthiness, ethics &amp; bias, safety, and legal aspects. We also outline in detail the implementation strategies that employ white-box, black-box, and gray-box methodologies that can be enforced within scientific contexts.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of LLM-based ASR and Whisper in Low Resource and Code Switching Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional performance across diverse NLP tasks, and their integration with speech encoder is rapidly emerging as a dominant trend in the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) field. Previous works mainly concentrated on leveraging LLMs for speech recognition in English and Chinese. However, their potential for addressing speech recognition challenges in low resource settings remains underexplored. Hence, in this work, we aim to explore the capability of LLMs in low resource ASR and Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We also evaluate and compare the recognition performance of LLM-based ASR systems against Whisper model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-based ASR yields a relative gain of 12.8\% over the Whisper model in low resource ASR while Whisper performs better in Mandarin-English code switching ASR. We hope that this study could shed light on ASR for low resource scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a visual process modeling tool for AI and machine learning in big data contexts, utilizing the LangGraph framework to construct intelligent Spark agents. The tool represents key machine learning stages - data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation - as modular components. Analysts can visually design workflows, which are then automatically translated into optimized Spark code for execution. This approach simplifies the complexity of Apache Spark, reduces the learning curve associated with Scala, and enhances code reusability. The paper discusses the theoretical foundations, key technologies, and evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description>

      <title>The Reality of AI and Biorisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accurately and confidently answer the question 'could an AI model or system increase biorisk', it is necessary to have both a sound theoretical threat model for how AI models or systems could increase biorisk and a robust method for testing that threat model. This paper provides an analysis of existing available research surrounding two AI and biorisk threat models: 1) access to information and planning via large language models (LLMs), and 2) the use of AI-enabled biological tools (BTs) in synthesizing novel biological artifacts. We find that existing studies around AI-related biorisk are nascent, often speculative in nature, or limited in terms of their methodological maturity and transparency. The available literature suggests that current LLMs and BTs do not pose an immediate risk, and more work is needed to develop rigorous approaches to understanding how future models could increase biorisks. We end with recommendations about how empirical work can be expanded to more precisely target biorisk and ensure rigor and validity of findings.</description>

      <title>Self-Improvement in Language Models: The Sharpening Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of self-improvement, where a language models evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample access, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families of self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the SFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient coverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based self-improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for coverage. Finally, we empirically validate the sharpening mechanism via inference-time and amortization experiments. We view these findings as a starting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design and evaluation of self-improvement algorithms.</description>

      <title>FCL-ViT: Task-Aware Attention Tuning for Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) involves adapting the prior Deep Neural Network (DNN) knowledge to new tasks, without forgetting the old ones. However, modern CL techniques focus on provisioning memory capabilities to existing DNN models rather than designing new ones that are able to adapt according to the task at hand. This paper presents the novel Feedback Continual Learning Vision Transformer (FCL-ViT) that uses a feedback mechanism to generate real-time dynamic attention features tailored to the current task. The FCL-ViT operates in two Phases. In phase 1, the generic image features are produced and determine where the Transformer should attend on the current image. In phase 2, task-specific image features are generated that leverage dynamic attention. To this end, Tunable self-Attention Blocks (TABs) and Task Specific Blocks (TSBs) are introduced that operate in both phases and are responsible for tuning the TABs attention, respectively. The FCL-ViT surpasses state-of-the-art performance on Continual Learning compared to benchmark methods, while retaining a small number of trainable DNN parameters.</description>

      <title>FocDepthFormer: Transformer with latent LSTM for Depth Estimation from Focal Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing methods for depth estimation from a focal stack of images employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using 2D or 3D convolutions over a fixed set of images. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the local properties of CNN kernels, which restricts them to process only focal stacks of fixed number of images during both training and inference. This limitation hampers their ability to generalize to stacks of arbitrary lengths. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel Transformer-based network, FocDepthFormer, which integrates a Transformer with an LSTM module and a CNN decoder. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows for the learning of more informative spatial features by implicitly performing non-local cross-referencing. The LSTM module is designed to integrate representations across image stacks of varying lengths. Additionally, we employ multi-scale convolutional kernels in an early-stage encoder to capture low-level features at different degrees of focus/defocus. By incorporating the LSTM, FocDepthFormer can be pre-trained on large-scale monocular RGB depth estimation datasets, improving visual pattern learning and reducing reliance on difficult-to-obtain focal stack data. Extensive experiments on diverse focal stack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Multimodal and Force-Matched Imitation Learning with a See-Through Visuotactile Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01248v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact-rich tasks continue to present many challenges for robotic manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy, simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%, visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable accurate task feedback.

      <title>StarVector: Generating Scalable Vector Graphics Code from Images and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Consistent Label Associations for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person ReID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00672v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) endeavors to retrieve pedestrian images of the same identity from different modalities without annotations. While prior work focuses on establishing cross-modality pseudo-label associations to bridge the modality-gap, they ignore maintaining the instance-level homogeneous and heterogeneous consistency between the feature space and the pseudo-label space, resulting in coarse associations. In response, we introduce a Modality-Unified Label Transfer (MULT) module that simultaneously accounts for both homogeneous and heterogeneous fine-grained instance-level structures, yielding high-quality cross-modality label associations. It models both homogeneous and heterogeneous affinities, leveraging them to quantify the inconsistency between the pseudo-label space and the feature space, subsequently minimizing it. The proposed MULT ensures that the generated pseudo-labels maintain alignment across modalities while upholding structural consistency within intra-modality. Additionally, a straightforward plug-and-play Online Cross-memory Label Refinement (OCLR) module is proposed to further mitigate the side effects of noisy pseudo-labels while simultaneously aligning different modalities, coupled with an Alternative Modality-Invariant Representation Learning (AMIRL) framework. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art USL-VI-ReID methods, highlighting the superiority of our MULT in comparison to other cross-modality association methods. Code is available at https://github.com/FranklinLingfeng/code_for_MULT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data as `surrogate data'. We study a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add.</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>

      <title>EMOVOME: A Dataset for Emotion Recognition in Spontaneous Real-Life Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous datasets for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) are scarce and frequently derived from laboratory environments or staged scenarios, such as TV shows, limiting their application in real-world contexts. We developed and publicly released the Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) dataset, including 999 voice messages from real conversations of 100 Spanish speakers on a messaging app, labeled in continuous and discrete emotions by expert and non-expert annotators. We evaluated speaker-independent SER models using acoustic features as baseline and transformer-based models. We compared the results with reference datasets including acted and elicited speech, and analyzed the influence of annotators and gender fairness. The pre-trained UniSpeech-SAT-Large model achieved the highest results, 61.64% and 55.57% Unweighted Accuracy (UA) for 3-class valence and arousal prediction respectively on EMOVOME, a 10% improvement over baseline models. For the emotion categories, 42.58% UA was obtained. EMOVOME performed lower than the acted RAVDESS dataset. The elicited IEMOCAP dataset also outperformed EMOVOME in predicting emotion categories, while similar results were obtained in valence and arousal. EMOVOME outcomes varied with annotator labels, showing better results and fairness when combining expert and non-expert annotations. This study highlights the gap between controlled and real-life scenarios, supporting further advancements in recognizing genuine emotions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for On-the-Fly Instruction Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of language processing and image processing keeps attracting increased interest given recent impressive advances that leverage the combined strengths of both domains of research. Among these advances, the task of editing an image on the basis solely of a natural language instruction stands out as a most challenging endeavour. While recent approaches for this task resort, in one way or other, to some form of preliminary preparation, training or fine-tuning, this paper explores a novel approach: We propose a preparation-free method that permits instruction-guided image editing on the fly. This approach is organized along three steps properly orchestrated that resort to image captioning and DDIM inversion, followed by obtaining the edit direction embedding, followed by image editing proper. While dispensing with preliminary preparation, our approach demonstrates to be effective and competitive, outperforming recent, state of the art models for this task when evaluated on the MAGICBRUSH dataset.</description>

      <title>Elephants Never Forget: Memorization and Learning of Tabular Data in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many have shown how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to a diverse set of tasks, the critical issues of data contamination and memorization are often glossed over. In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</description>

      <title>SurvMamba: State Space Model with Multi-grained Multi-modal Interaction for Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning that combines pathological images with genomic data has significantly enhanced the accuracy of survival prediction. Nevertheless, existing methods have not fully utilized the inherent hierarchical structure within both whole slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic data, from which better intra-modal representations and inter-modal integration could be derived. Moreover, many existing studies attempt to improve multi-modal representations through attention mechanisms, which inevitably lead to high complexity when processing high-dimensional WSIs and transcriptomic data. Recently, a structured state space model named Mamba emerged as a promising approach for its superior performance in modeling long sequences with low complexity. In this study, we propose Mamba with multi-grained multi-modal interaction (SurvMamba) for survival prediction. SurvMamba is implemented with a Hierarchical Interaction Mamba (HIM) module that facilitates efficient intra-modal interactions at different granularities, thereby capturing more detailed local features as well as rich global representations. In addition, an Interaction Fusion Mamba (IFM) module is used for cascaded inter-modal interactive fusion, yielding more comprehensive features for survival prediction. Comprehensive evaluations on five TCGA datasets demonstrate that SurvMamba outperforms other existing methods in terms of performance and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Towards a Robust Soft Baby Robot With Rich Interaction Ability for Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced machine learning algorithms require platforms that are extremely robust and equipped with rich sensory feedback to handle extensive trial-and-error learning without relying on strong inductive biases. Traditional robotic designs, while well-suited for their specific use cases, are often fragile when used with these algorithms. To address this gap -- and inspired by the vision of enabling curiosity-driven baby robots -- we present a novel robotic limb designed from scratch. Our design has a hybrid soft-hard structure, high redundancy with rich non-contact sensors (exclusively cameras), and easily replaceable failure points. Proof-of-concept experiments using two contemporary reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical prototype demonstrate that our design is able to succeed in a simple target-finding task even under simulated sensor failures, all with minimal human oversight during extended learning periods. We believe this design represents a concrete step toward more tailored robotic designs for achieving general-purpose, generally intelligent robots.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Diffusion-Driven Optical Image Translation for Large-Scale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11243v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comparing images captured by disparate sensors is a common challenge in remote sensing. This requires image translation -- converting imagery from one sensor domain to another while preserving the original content. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) are potential state-of-the-art solutions for such domain translation due to their proven superiority in multiple image-to-image translation tasks in computer vision. However, these models struggle with reproducing radiometric features of large-scale multi-patch imagery, resulting in inconsistencies across the full image. This renders downstream tasks like Heterogeneous Change Detection impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages denoising diffusion for effective multi-sensor optical image translation over large areas. Our approach super-resolves large-scale low spatial resolution images into high-resolution equivalents from disparate optical sensors, ensuring uniformity across hundreds of patches. Our contributions lie in new forward and reverse diffusion processes that address the challenges of large-scale image translation. Extensive experiments using paired Sentinel-II (10m) and Planet Dove (3m) images demonstrate that our approach provides precise domain adaptation, preserving image content while improving radiometric accuracy and feature representation. A thorough image quality assessment and comparisons with the standard DDIM framework and five other leading methods are presented. We reach a mean Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (mLPIPS) of 0.1884 and a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 45.64, expressively outperforming all compared methods, including DDIM, ShuffleMixer, and SwinIR. The usefulness of our approach is further demonstrated in two Heterogeneous Change Detection tasks.</description>

      <title>IMWA: Iterative Model Weight Averaging Benefits Class-Imbalanced Learning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Weight Averaging (MWA) is a technique that seeks to enhance model's performance by averaging the weights of multiple trained models. This paper first empirically finds that 1) the vanilla MWA can benefit the class-imbalanced learning, and 2) performing model averaging in the early epochs of training yields a greater performance improvement than doing that in later epochs. Inspired by these two observations, in this paper we propose a novel MWA technique for class-imbalanced learning tasks named Iterative Model Weight Averaging (IMWA). Specifically, IMWA divides the entire training stage into multiple episodes. Within each episode, multiple models are concurrently trained from the same initialized model weight, and subsequently averaged into a singular model. Then, the weight of this average model serves as a fresh initialization for the ensuing episode, thus establishing an iterative learning paradigm. Compared to vanilla MWA, IMWA achieves higher performance improvements with the same computational cost. Moreover, IMWA can further enhance the performance of those methods employing EMA strategy, demonstrating that IMWA and EMA can complement each other. Extensive experiments on various class-imbalanced learning tasks, i.e., class-imbalanced image classification, semi-supervised class-imbalanced image classification and semi-supervised object detection tasks showcase the effectiveness of our IMWA.</description>

      <title>Segmentation-Free Outcome Prediction from Head and Neck Cancer PET/CT Images: Deep Learning-Based Feature Extraction from Multi-Angle Maximum Intensity Projections (MA-MIPs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative, simple, effective segmentation-free approach for outcome prediction in head \&amp; neck cancer (HNC) patients. By harnessing deep learning-based feature extraction techniques and multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) applied to Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) volumes, our proposed method eliminates the need for manual segmentations of regions-of-interest (ROIs) such as primary tumors and involved lymph nodes. Instead, a state-of-the-art object detection model is trained to perform automatic cropping of the head and neck region on the PET volumes. A pre-trained deep convolutional neural network backbone is then utilized to extract deep features from MA-MIPs obtained from 72 multi-angel axial rotations of the cropped PET volumes. These deep features extracted from multiple projection views of the PET volumes are then aggregated and fused, and employed to perform recurrence-free survival analysis on a cohort of 489 HNC patients. The proposed approach outperforms the best performing method on the target dataset for the task of recurrence-free survival analysis. By circumventing the manual delineation of the malignancies on the FDG PET-CT images, our approach eliminates the dependency on subjective interpretations and highly enhances the reproducibility of the proposed survival analysis method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues across various fields, including cybersecurity, which faces an evolving threat landscape and demand for innovative technologies. Despite initial explorations into the application of LLMs in cybersecurity, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of this research area. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic literature review, covering the analysis of over 300 works, encompassing 25 LLMs and more than 10 downstream scenarios. Our comprehensive overview addresses three key research questions: the construction of cybersecurity-oriented LLMs, the application of LLMs to various cybersecurity tasks, the challenges and further research in this area. This study aims to shed light on the extensive potential of LLMs in enhancing cybersecurity practices and serve as a valuable resource for applying LLMs in this field. We also maintain and regularly update a list of practical guides on LLMs for cybersecurity at https://github.com/tmylla/Awesome-LLM4Cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Spectral Augmentation for Contrast-based Graph Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in contrast-based graph self-supervised learning has prominently featured an intensified exploration of spectral cues. Spectral augmentation, which involves modifying a graph's spectral properties such as eigenvalues or eigenvectors, is widely believed to enhance model performance. However, an intriguing paradox emerges, as methods grounded in seemingly conflicting assumptions regarding the spectral domain demonstrate notable enhancements in learning performance. Through extensive empirical studies, we find that simple edge perturbations - random edge dropping for node-level and random edge adding for graph-level self-supervised learning - consistently yield comparable or superior performance while being significantly more computationally efficient. This suggests that the computational overhead of sophisticated spectral augmentations may not justify their practical benefits. Our theoretical analysis of the InfoNCE loss bounds for shallow GNNs further supports this observation. The proposed insights represent a significant leap forward in the field, potentially refining the understanding and implementation of graph self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and loading operations at ports, integrating quay-crane dual-cycling with dockyard rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations: ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically, optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising one-dimensional and two-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time for large vessels. Statistical validation through a two-tailed paired t-test confirms the superiority of QCDC-DR-GA at a 5% significance level. The approach effectively combines QCDC optimization with dockyard rehandle minimization, optimizing the total unloading-loading time. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads to inferior performance than QCDC-DR-GA. This emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously considering both aspects for optimal resource utilization and overall operational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Temporal logic rules are often used in control and robotics to provide structured, human-interpretable descriptions of high-dimensional trajectory data. These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data do not provide assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild assumptions. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</description>

      <title>tcrLM: a lightweight protein language model for predicting T cell receptor and epitope binding specificity</title>

Abstract: The anti-cancer immune response relies on the bindings between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and antigens, which elicits adaptive immunity to eliminate tumor cells. This ability of the immune system to respond to novel various neoantigens arises from the immense diversity of TCR repository. However, TCR diversity poses a significant challenge on accurately predicting antigen-TCR bindings. In this study, we introduce a lightweight masked language model, termed tcrLM, to address this challenge. Our approach involves randomly masking segments of TCR sequences and training tcrLM to infer the masked segments, thereby enabling the extraction of expressive features from TCR sequences. To further enhance robustness, we incorporate virtual adversarial training into tcrLM. We construct the largest TCR CDR3 sequence set with more than 100 million distinct sequences, and pretrain tcrLM on these sequences. The pre-trained encoder is subsequently applied to predict TCR-antigen binding specificity. We evaluate model performance on three test datasets: independent, external, and COVID-19 test set. The results demonstrate that tcrLM not only surpasses existing TCR-antigen binding prediction methods, but also outperforms other mainstream protein language models. More interestingly, tcrLM effectively captures the biochemical properties and positional preference of amino acids within TCR sequences. Additionally, the predicted TCR-neoantigen binding scores indicates the immunotherapy responses and clinical outcomes in a melanoma cohort. These findings demonstrate the potential of tcrLM in predicting TCR-antigen binding specificity, with significant implications for advancing immunotherapy and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>The Cooperative Network Architecture: Learning Structured Networks as Representation of Sensory Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nets, cooperative networks of neurons, have been proposed as format for the representation of sensory signals, as physical implementation of the Gestalt phenomenon and as solution to the neural binding problem, while the direct interaction between nets by structure-sensitive matching has been proposed as basis for object-global operations such as object detection. The nets are flexibly composed of overlapping net fragments, which are learned from statistical regularities of sensory input. We here present the cooperative network architecture (CNA), a concrete model that learns such net structure to represent input patterns and deals robustly with noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, thus laying the groundwork for a novel neural architecture.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Data Deduplication for Enhancing Federated Learning of Language Models (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.62\% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95\% reduction in running time while varying the duplication level between 10\% and 30\%. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ever-growing volume of biomedical publications creates a critical need for efficient knowledge discovery. In this context, we introduce an open-source end-to-end framework designed to construct knowledge around specific diseases directly from raw text. To facilitate research in disease-related knowledge discovery, we create two annotated datasets focused on Rett syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, enabling the identification of semantic relations between biomedical entities. Extensive benchmarking explores various ways to represent relations and entity representations, offering insights into optimal modeling strategies for semantic relation detection and highlighting language models' competence in knowledge discovery. We also conduct probing experiments using different layer representations and attention scores to explore transformers' ability to capture semantic relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.</description>

      <title>DragText: Rethinking Text Embedding in Point-based Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point-based image editing enables accurate and flexible control through content dragging. However, the role of text embedding during the editing process has not been thoroughly investigated. A significant aspect that remains unexplored is the interaction between text and image embeddings. During the progressive editing in a diffusion model, the text embedding remains constant. As the image embedding increasingly diverges from its initial state, the discrepancy between the image and text embeddings presents a significant challenge. In this study, we found that the text prompt significantly influences the dragging process, particularly in maintaining content integrity and achieving the desired manipulation. Upon these insights, we propose DragText, which optimizes text embedding in conjunction with the dragging process to pair with the modified image embedding. Simultaneously, we regularize the text optimization process to preserve the integrity of the original text prompt. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing diffusion-based drag methods, enhancing performance with only a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>How to Segment in 3D Using 2D Models: Automated 3D Segmentation of Prostate Cancer Metastatic Lesions on PET Volumes Using Multi-angle Maximum Intensity Projections and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging provides a tremendously exciting frontier in visualization of prostate cancer (PCa) metastatic lesions. However, accurate segmentation of metastatic lesions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios and variable sizes, shapes, and locations of the lesions. This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of metastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D volumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle maximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains the final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic PCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for quantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.</description>

      <title>Nl2Hltl2Plan: Scaling Up Natural Language Understanding for Multi-Robots Through Hierarchical Temporal Logic Task Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next, a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

      <title>COVID-19 Probability Prediction Using Machine Learning: An Infectious Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose significant challenges to global public health, despite the widespread availability of vaccines. Early detection of the disease remains paramount in curbing its transmission and mitigating its impact on public health systems. In response, this study delves into the application of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting COVID-19 infection probability. We conducted a rigorous investigation into the efficacy of various ML models, including XGBoost, LGBM, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest, CatBoost, KNN, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Leveraging a dataset comprising 4000 samples, with 3200 allocated for training and 800 for testing, our experiment offers comprehensive insights into the performance of these models in COVID-19 prediction. Our findings reveal that Deep Neural Networks (DNN) emerge as the top-performing model, exhibiting superior accuracy and recall metrics. With an impressive accuracy rate of 89%, DNN demonstrates remarkable potential in early COVID-19 detection. This underscores the efficacy of deep learning approaches in leveraging complex data patterns to identify COVID-19 infections accurately. This study underscores the critical role of machine learning, particularly deep learning methodologies, in augmenting early detection efforts amidst the ongoing pandemic. The success of DNN in accurately predicting COVID-19 infection probability highlights the importance of continued research and development in leveraging advanced technologies to combat infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Enhanced ISAC Precoding for Vehicular Networks with Double Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology is vital for vehicular networks, yet the time-varying communication channels and rapid movement of targets present significant challenges for real-time precoding design. Traditional optimization-based methods are computationally complex and depend on perfect prior information, which is often unavailable in double-dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a synesthesia of machine (SoM)-enhanced precoding paradigm that leverages modalities such as positioning and channel information to adapt to these dynamics. Utilizing a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, our approach pushes ISAC performance boundaries. We also introduce a parameter-shared actor-critic architecture to accelerate training in complex state and action spaces. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>PolarBEVDet: Exploring Polar Representation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection in Bird's-Eye-View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, LSS-based multi-view 3D object detection provides an economical and deployment-friendly solution for autonomous driving. However, all the existing LSS-based methods transform multi-view image features into a Cartesian Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) representation, which does not take into account the non-uniform image information distribution and hardly exploits the view symmetry. In this paper, in order to adapt the image information distribution and preserve the view symmetry by regular convolution, we propose to employ the polar BEV representation to substitute the Cartesian BEV representation. To achieve this, we elaborately tailor three modules: a polar view transformer to generate the polar BEV representation, a polar temporal fusion module for fusing historical polar BEV features and a polar detection head to predict the polar-parameterized representation of the object. In addition, we design a 2D auxiliary detection head and a spatial attention enhancement module to improve the quality of feature extraction in perspective view and BEV, respectively. Finally, we integrate the above improvements into a novel multi-view 3D object detector, PolarBEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes show that PolarBEVDet achieves the superior performance.

      <title>Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with flow matching policy also leads to consistently better results than alternative behavior cloning methods, including marginally better generalization performance and prominently faster inference than diffusion policy with DDPM. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset at https://github.com/kimdanny/Fair-RAG.</description>

      <title>DualAD: Dual-Layer Planning for Reasoning in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations. Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding. Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs, indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement.

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.

      <title>One Initialization to Rule them All: Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across the model weights. Recent works focus on different initialization schemes or the learning of adaptive ranks during fine-tuning. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to suboptimal performance. We propose to improve LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition (SVD) on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and redistribute ranks among all weight matrices to provably store the maximum amount of information of the downstream data in the newly introduced weights. In this way, only what information to maintain or neglect during the fine-tuning process needs to be learned. We call our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution.</description>

      <title>D-Wave's Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver: Description and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of advanced quantum-classical algorithms is among the most prominent strategies in quantum computing. Numerous hybrid solvers have been introduced recently. Many of these methods are created ad hoc to address specific use cases. However, several well-established schemes are frequently utilized to address optimization problems. In this context, D-Wave launched the Hybrid Solver Service in 2020, offering a portfolio of methods designed to accelerate time-to-solution for users aiming to optimize performance and operational processes. Recently, a new technique has been added to this portfolio: the Nonlinear-Program Hybrid Solver. This paper describes this solver and evaluates its performance through a benchmark of 45 instances across three combinatorial optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the Knapsack Problem, and the Maximum Cut Problem. To facilitate the use of this relatively unexplored solver, we provide details of the implementation used to solve these three optimization problems.</description>

      <title>CryoFM: A Flow-based Foundation Model for Cryo-EM Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Restoration: Multi-Task Image Restoration Models are Zero-Shot Step-by-Step Universal Image Restorers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite previous image restoration (IR) methods have often concentrated on isolated degradations, recent research has increasingly focused on addressing composite degradations involving a complex combination of multiple isolated degradations. However, current IR methods for composite degradations require building training data that contain an exponential number of possible degradation combinations, which brings in a significant burden. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a new task setting, i.e. Universal Image Restoration (UIR). Specifically, UIR doesn't require training on all the degradation combinations but only on a set of degradation bases and then removing any degradation that these bases can potentially compose in a zero-shot manner. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought that prompts large language models (LLMs) to address problems step-by-step, we propose Chain-of-Restoration (CoR) mechanism, which instructs models to remove unknown composite degradations step-by-step. By integrating a simple Degradation Discriminator into pre-trained multi-task models, CoR facilitates the process where models remove one degradation basis per step, continuing this process until the image is fully restored from the unknown composite degradation. Extensive experiments show that CoR can significantly improve model performance in removing composite degradations, achieving comparable or better results than those state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on all degradations.</description>

      <title>Can In-context Learning Really Generalize to Out-of-distribution Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks.</description>

      <title>Preserve or Modify? Context-Aware Evaluation for Balancing Preservation and Modification in Text-Guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the \textit{preservation} of core elements in the source image while implementing \textit{modifications} based on the target text. However, existing metrics have a \textbf{context-blindness} problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose \texttt{AugCLIP}, a \textbf{context-aware} metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, \texttt{AugCLIP} augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that \texttt{AugCLIP} aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing metrics. The code will be open-sourced for community use.</description>

      <title>DEL-Ranking: Ranking-Correction Denoising Framework for Elucidating Molecular Affinities in DNA-Encoded Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening has revolutionized the detection of protein-ligand interactions through read counts, enabling rapid exploration of vast chemical spaces. However, noise in read counts, stemming from nonspecific interactions, can mislead this exploration process. We present DEL-Ranking, a novel distribution-correction denoising framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel ranking loss that rectifies relative magnitude relationships between read counts, enabling the learning of causal features determining activity levels, and (2) an iterative algorithm employing self-training and consistency loss to establish model coherence between activity label and read count predictions. Furthermore, we contribute three new DEL screening datasets, the first to comprehensively include multi-dimensional molecular representations, protein-ligand enrichment values, and their activity labels. These datasets mitigate data scarcity issues in AI-driven DEL screening research. Rigorous evaluation on diverse DEL datasets demonstrates DEL-Ranking's superior performance across multiple correlation metrics, with significant improvements in binding affinity prediction accuracy. Our model exhibits zero-shot generalization ability across different protein targets and successfully identifies potential motifs determining compound binding affinity. This work advances DEL screening analysis and provides valuable resources for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Understanding Representation of Deep Equilibrium Models from Neural Collapse Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Dense Reward: Understanding the Gap Between Action and Reward Space in Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven highly effective in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the original RLHF typically optimizes under an overall reward, which can lead to a suboptimal learning process. This limitation stems from RLHF's lack of awareness regarding which specific tokens should be reinforced or suppressed. Moreover, conflicts in supervision can arise, for instance, when a chosen response includes erroneous tokens, while a rejected response contains accurate elements. To rectify these shortcomings, increasing dense reward methods, such as step-wise and token-wise RLHF, have been proposed. However, these existing methods are limited to specific tasks (like mathematics). In this paper, we propose the ``Adaptive Message-wise RLHF'' method, which robustly applies to various tasks. By defining pivot tokens as key indicators, our approach adaptively identifies essential information and converts sequence-level supervision into fine-grained, subsequence-level supervision. This aligns the density of rewards and action spaces more closely with the information density of the input. Experiments demonstrate that our method can be integrated into various training methods, significantly mitigating hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting problems, while outperforming other methods on multiple evaluation metrics. Our method improves the success rate on adversarial samples by 10\% compared to the sample-wise approach, and achieves a 1.3\% improvement on evaluation benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, etc.</description>

      <title>GWQ: Gradient-Aware Weight Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show impressive performance in solving complex language tasks. However, its large number of parameters present significant challenges for the deployment and application of the model on edge devices. Compressing large language models to low bits can enable them to run on resource-constrained devices, often leading to performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose gradient-aware weight quantization (GWQ), the first quantization approach for low-bit weight quantization that leverages gradients to localize outliers, requiring only a minimal amount of calibration data for outlier detection. GWQ retains the weights corresponding to the top 1% outliers preferentially at FP16 precision, while the remaining non-outlier weights are stored in a low-bit format. GWQ found experimentally that utilizing the sensitive weights in the gradient localization model is more scientific compared to utilizing the sensitive weights in the Hessian matrix localization model. Compared to current quantization methods, GWQ can be applied to multiple language models and achieves lower PPL on the WikiText2 and C4 dataset. In the zero-shot task, GWQ quantized models have higher accuracy compared to other quantization methods. GWQ is also suitable for multimodal model quantization, and the quantized Qwen-VL family model is more accurate than other methods. Zero-shot target detection task dataset RefCOCO outperforms the current stat-of-the-arts method SPQR. GWQ achieves 1.2 times inference speedup in comparison to the original model, and effectively reduces the inference memory.</description>

      <title>Local Lesion Generation is Effective for Capsule Endoscopy Image Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limited medical imaging datasets challenge deep learning models by increasing risks of overfitting and reduced generalization, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where discriminators may overfit, leading to training divergence. This constraint also impairs classification models trained on small datasets. Generative Data Augmentation (GDA) addresses this by expanding training datasets with synthetic data, although it requires training a generative model. We propose and evaluate two local lesion generation approaches to address the challenge of augmenting small medical image datasets. The first approach employs the Poisson Image Editing algorithm, a classical image processing technique, to create realistic image composites that outperform current state-of-the-art methods. The second approach introduces a novel generative method, leveraging a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN to synthesize realistic lesions within specified regions of real training images. A comprehensive comparison of the two proposed methods demonstrates that effective local lesion generation in a data-constrained setting allows for reaching new state-of-the-art results in capsule endoscopy lesion classification. Combination of our techniques achieves a macro F1-score of 33.07%, surpassing the previous best result by 7.84 percentage points (p.p.) on the highly imbalanced Kvasir Capsule Dataset, a benchmark for capsule endoscopy. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply a fine-tuned Image Inpainting GAN for GDA in medical imaging, demonstrating that an image-conditional GAN can be adapted effectively to limited datasets to generate high-quality examples, facilitating effective data augmentation. Additionally, we show that combining this GAN-based approach with classical image processing techniques further improves the results.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as 9.11 &gt; 9.9). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We also finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of NUPA in LLMs. Our benchmark and code are released at https://github.com/GraphPKU/number_cookbook.</description>

      <title>Mediating Modes of Thought: LLM's for design scripting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architects adopt visual scripting and parametric design tools to explore more expansive design spaces (Coates, 2010), refine their thinking about the geometric logic of their design (Woodbury, 2010), and overcome conventional software limitations (Burry, 2011). Despite two decades of effort to make design scripting more accessible, a disconnect between a designer's free ways of thinking and the rigidity of algorithms remains (Burry, 2011). Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest this might soon change, as LLMs encode a general understanding of human context and exhibit the capacity to produce geometric logic. This project speculates that if LLMs can effectively mediate between user intent and algorithms, they become a powerful tool to make scripting in design more widespread and fun. We explore if such systems can interpret natural language prompts to assemble geometric operations relevant to computational design scripting. In the system, multiple layers of LLM agents are configured with specific context to infer the user intent and construct a sequential logic. Given a user's high-level text prompt, a geometric description is created, distilled into a sequence of logic operations, and mapped to software-specific commands. The completed script is constructed in the user's visual programming interface. The system succeeds in generating complete visual scripts up to a certain complexity but fails beyond this complexity threshold. It shows how LLMs can make design scripting much more aligned with human creativity and thought. Future research should explore conversational interactions, expand to multimodal inputs and outputs, and assess the performance of these tools.</description>

      <title>Can Open-source LLMs Enhance Data Synthesis for Toxic Detection?: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective toxic content detection relies heavily on high-quality and diverse data, which serves as the foundation for robust content moderation models. This study explores the potential of open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis, utilizing prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques to enhance data quality and diversity. In a two-stage evaluation, we first examine the capabilities of six open-source LLMs in generating harmful data across multiple datasets using prompt engineering. In the second stage, we fine-tune these models to improve data generation while addressing challenges such as hallucination, data duplication, and overfitting. Our findings reveal that Mistral excels in generating high-quality and diverse harmful data with minimal hallucination. Furthermore, fine-tuning enhances data quality, offering scalable and cost-effective solutions for augmenting datasets for specific toxic content detection tasks. These results emphasize the significance of data synthesis in building robust, standalone detection models and highlight the potential of open-source LLMs to advance smaller downstream content moderation systems. We implemented this approach in real-world industrial settings, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of fine-tuned open-source LLMs for harmful data synthesis.</description>

      <title>LLMs Do Not Think Step-by-step In Implicit Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been well-known that Chain-of-Thought can remarkably enhance LLMs' performance on complex tasks. However, because it also introduces slower inference speeds and higher computational costs, many researches have attempted to use implicit CoT, which does not need LLMs to explicitly generate the intermediate steps. But there is still gap between their efficacy and typical explicit CoT methods. This leaves us a doubt that, does implicit CoT really equal to explicit CoT? Therefore, in this study, we address this question through experiments. We probe the information of intermediate steps from the model's hidden states when it is performing implicit CoT. The results surprisingly indicate that LLMs hardly think about intermediate steps, suggesting they may just rely on experience rather than strict step-by-step reasoning. Moreover, we find LLMs' implicit reasoning capabilities are susceptible and unstable, reaffirming the necessity of explicit CoT to effectively support complex tasks.</description>

      <title>"Moralized" Multi-Step Jailbreak Prompts: Black-Box Testing of Guardrails in Large Language Models for Verbal Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the application of large language models continues to expand in various fields, it poses higher challenges to the effectiveness of identifying harmful content generation and guardrail mechanisms. This research aims to evaluate the guardrail effectiveness of GPT-4o, Grok-2 Beta, Llama 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet through black-box testing of seemingly ethical multi-step jailbreak prompts. It conducts ethical attacks by designing an identical multi-step prompts that simulates the scenario of "corporate middle managers competing for promotions." The data results show that the guardrails of the above-mentioned LLMs were bypassed and the content of verbal attacks was generated. Claude 3.5 Sonnet's resistance to multi-step jailbreak prompts is more obvious. To ensure objectivity, the experimental process, black box test code, and enhanced guardrail code are uploaded to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/brucewang123456789/GeniusTrail.git.</description>

      <title>RelCon: Relative Contrastive Learning for a Motion Foundation Model for Wearable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RelCon, a novel self-supervised *Rel*ative *Con*trastive learning approach that uses a learnable distance measure in combination with a softened contrastive loss for training an motion foundation model from wearable sensors. The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</description>

      <title>Marconi: Prefix Caching for the Era of Hybrid LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid models that combine the language modeling capabilities of Attention layers with the efficiency of Recurrent layers (e.g., State Space Models) have gained traction in practically supporting long contexts in Large Language Model serving. Yet, the unique properties of these models complicate the usage of complementary efficiency optimizations such as prefix caching that skip redundant computations across requests. Most notably, their use of in-place state updates for recurrent layers precludes rolling back cache entries for partial sequence overlaps, and instead mandates only exact-match cache hits; the effect is a deluge of (large) cache entries per sequence, most of which yield minimal reuse opportunities. We present Marconi, the first system that supports efficient prefix caching with Hybrid LLMs. Key to Marconi are its novel admission and eviction policies that more judiciously assess potential cache entries based not only on recency, but also on (1) forecasts of their reuse likelihood across a taxonomy of different hit scenarios, and (2) the compute savings that hits deliver relative to memory footprints. Across diverse workloads and Hybrid models, Marconi achieves up to 34.4$\times$ higher token hit rates (71.1% or 617 ms lower TTFT) compared to state-of-the-art prefix caching systems.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Perception Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs with Training-Free Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) equip language models with visual capabilities by aligning vision encoders with language models. Existing methods to enhance the visual perception of MLLMs often involve designing more powerful vision encoders, which requires exploring a vast design space and re-aligning each potential encoder with the language model, resulting in prohibitively high training costs. In this paper, we introduce VisionFuse, a novel integration framework that efficiently utilizes multiple vision encoders from off-the-shelf MLLMs to enhance visual perception without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that different MLLMs tend to focus on distinct regions given the same query and image. Moreover, we find that the feature distributions of vision encoders within an MLLM family, a group of MLLMs sharing the same pretrained LLM, are highly aligned. Building on these insights, VisionFuse enriches the visual context by concatenating the tokens generated by the vision encoders of selected MLLMs within a family. By merging the parameters of language models from these MLLMs, VisionFuse allows a single language model to align with various vision encoders, significantly reducing deployment overhead. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple multimodal benchmarks using various MLLM combinations, demonstrating substantial improvements in multimodal tasks. Notably, when integrating MiniGemini-8B and SLIME-8B, VisionFuse achieves an average performance increase of over 4%.</description>

      <title>Explainable fault and severity classification for rolling element bearings using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rolling element bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, with their performance directly influencing the efficiency and reliability of industrial systems. At the same time, bearing faults are a leading cause of machinery failures, often resulting in costly downtime, reduced productivity, and, in extreme cases, catastrophic damage. This study presents a methodology that utilizes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to address these challenges through automatic feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and interpretable fault analysis within a unified framework. By training shallow network architectures and minimizing the number of selected features, the framework produces lightweight models that deliver explainable results through feature attribution and symbolic representations of their activation functions. Validated on two widely recognized datasets for bearing fault diagnosis, the framework achieved perfect F1-Scores for fault detection and high performance in fault and severity classification tasks, including 100% F1-Scores in most cases. Notably, it demonstrated adaptability by handling diverse fault types, such as imbalance and misalignment, within the same dataset. The symbolic representations enhanced model interpretability, while feature attribution offered insights into the optimal feature types or signals for each studied task. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical applications, such as real-time machinery monitoring, and for scientific research requiring efficient and explainable models.</description>

      <title>The use of large language models to enhance cancer clinical trial educational materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cancer clinical trials often face challenges in recruitment and engagement due to a lack of participant-facing informational and educational resources. This study investigated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in generating patient-friendly educational content from clinical trial informed consent forms. Using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we employed zero-shot learning for creating trial summaries and one-shot learning for developing multiple-choice questions, evaluating their effectiveness through patient surveys and crowdsourced annotation. Results showed that GPT4-generated summaries were both readable and comprehensive, and may improve patients' understanding and interest in clinical trials. The multiple-choice questions demonstrated high accuracy and agreement with crowdsourced annotators. For both resource types, hallucinations were identified that require ongoing human oversight. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs "out-of-the-box" to support the generation of clinical trial education materials with minimal trial-specific engineering, but implementation with a human-in-the-loop is still needed to avoid misinformation risks.</description>

      <title>DataLab: A Unified Platform for LLM-Powered Business Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Business intelligence (BI) transforms large volumes of data within modern organizations into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports a wide range of BI tasks for different data roles by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.</description>

      <title>Scaling Image Tokenizers with Grouped Spherical Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision tokenizers have gained a lot of attraction due to their scalability and compactness; previous works depend on old-school GAN-based hyperparameters, biased comparisons, and a lack of comprehensive analysis of the scaling behaviours. To tackle those issues, we introduce Grouped Spherical Quantization (GSQ), featuring spherical codebook initialization and lookup regularization to constrain codebook latent to a spherical surface. Our empirical analysis of image tokenizer training strategies demonstrates that GSQ-GAN achieves superior reconstruction quality over state-of-the-art methods with fewer training iterations, providing a solid foundation for scaling studies. Building on this, we systematically examine the scaling behaviours of GSQ, specifically in latent dimensionality, codebook size, and compression ratios, and their impact on model performance. Our findings reveal distinct behaviours at high and low spatial compression levels, underscoring challenges in representing high-dimensional latent spaces. We show that GSQ can restructure high-dimensional latent into compact, low-dimensional spaces, thus enabling efficient scaling with improved quality. As a result, GSQ-GAN achieves a 16x down-sampling with a reconstruction FID (rFID) of 0.50.</description>
