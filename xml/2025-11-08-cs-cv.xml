      <title>LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii) fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged. This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1. LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms.</description>

      <title>SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of large volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct observations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused primarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the detection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding social and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation tools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals, or localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this gap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both functionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and interactions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable for training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral ecology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated approaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily in the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to annotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic scene graphs. The software, along with documentation and download instructions, is available at: https://gitlab.gwdg.de/kanbertay/interaction-labelling-app.</description>

      <title>Noise Injection: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization for Limited Size Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to generalize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection from Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the training set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts - source-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather than reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID) data. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study investigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian, Speckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results demonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap between ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results averaged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy, recall and specificity.

      <title>Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest in video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach applies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is because interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine opportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided cannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated simulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We curate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray sequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train imitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively align a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled setup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our policy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe intra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy generalized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to varied initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that the model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in simulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify limitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will require additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent feedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide a foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic intra-operative spinal navigation.</description>

      <title>Desert Waste Detection and Classification Using Data-Based and Model-Based Enhanced YOLOv12 DL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected to increase by 70% by 2050. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we propose an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned, lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset, we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.</description>

      <title>Improving Diagnostic Performance on Small and Imbalanced Datasets Using Class-Based Input Image Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small, imbalanced datasets and poor input image quality can lead to high false predictions rates with deep learning models. This paper introduces Class-Based Image Composition, an approach that allows us to reformulate training inputs through a fusion of multiple images of the same class into combined visual composites, named Composite Input Images (CoImg). That enhances the intra-class variance and improves the valuable information density per training sample and increases the ability of the model to distinguish between subtle disease patterns. Our method was evaluated on the Optical Coherence Tomography Dataset for Image-Based Deep Learning Methods (OCTDL) (Kulyabin et al., 2024), which contains 2,064 high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the human retina, representing seven distinct diseases with a significant class imbalance. We constructed a perfectly class-balanced version of this dataset, named Co-OCTDL, where each scan is resented as a 3x1 layout composite image. To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we conducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant using a VGG16 model. A fair comparison was ensured by utilizing the identical model architecture and hyperparameters for all experiments. The proposed approach markedly improved diagnostic results.The enhanced Dataset achieved near-perfect accuracy (99.6%) with F1-score (0.995) and AUC (0.9996), compared to a baseline model trained on raw dataset. The false prediction rate was also significantly lower, this demonstrates that the method can producehigh-quality predictions even for weak datasets affected by class imbalance or small sample size.</description>

      <title>I Detect What I Don't Know: Incremental Anomaly Learning with Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian for Oracle-Free Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert supervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that incrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly labels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method alternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample admission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny convolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible computational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset enabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during incremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is admitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset lies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic uncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents drift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or replay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of normality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines. On COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on Pneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5, ROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework for real-world, label-scarce medical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Refinement: Continuous Depth Allocation and Distance Regression for Efficient Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal action localization requires precise boundary detection; however, current methods apply uniform computation despite significant variations in difficulty across boundaries. We present two complementary contributions. First, Boundary Distance Regression (BDR) provides information-theoretically optimal localization through signed-distance regression rather than classification, achieving 43\% sharper boundary peaks. BDR retrofits to existing methods with approximately 50 lines of code, yielding consistent 1.8 to 3.1\% mAP@0.7 improvements across diverse architectures. Second, Adaptive Temporal Refinement (ATR) allocates computation via continuous depth selection $\tau \in [0,1]$, enabling end-to-end differentiable optimization without reinforcement learning. On THUMOS14, ATR achieves 56.5\% mAP@0.7 at 162G FLOPs, compared to 53.6\% at 198G for uniform processing, providing a 2.9\% improvement with 18\% less compute. Gains scale with boundary heterogeneity, showing 4.2\% improvement on short actions. Training cost is mitigated via knowledge distillation, with lightweight students retaining 99\% performance at baseline cost. Results are validated across four benchmarks with rigorous statistical testing.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-View Reconstruction via Texture-Guided Gaussian-Mesh Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for applications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing methods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or photorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and appearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper advocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for seamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions and faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering, leveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric regularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D reconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as relighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>A Linear Fractional Transformation Model and Calibration Method for Light Field Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calibration of internal parameters is a crucial yet challenging prerequisite for 3D reconstruction using light field cameras. In this paper, we propose a linear fractional transformation(LFT) parameter $\alpha$ to decoupled the main lens and micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method includes an analytical solution based on least squares, followed by nonlinear refinement. The method for detecting features from the raw images is also introduced. Experimental results on both physical and simulated data have verified the performance of proposed method. Based on proposed model, the simulation of raw light field images becomes faster, which is crucial for data-driven deep learning methods. The corresponding code can be obtained from the author's website.</description>

      <title>Room Envelopes: A Synthetic Dataset for Indoor Layout Reconstruction from Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar, repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent, as well as the shape and location of its objects.</description>

      <title>Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.</description>

      <title>CaRF: Enhancing Multi-View Consistency in Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically, CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization. Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively. Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and autonomous perception.</description>

      <title>PhysCorr: Dual-Reward DPO for Physics-Constrained Text-to-Video Generation with Automated Preference Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality, yet generated content often violates fundamental principles of physical plausibility - manifesting as implausible object dynamics, incoherent interactions, and unrealistic motion patterns. Such failures hinder the deployment of video generation models in embodied AI, robotics, and simulation-intensive domains. To bridge this gap, we propose PhysCorr, a unified framework for modeling, evaluating, and optimizing physical consistency in video generation. Specifically, we introduce PhysicsRM, the first dual-dimensional reward model that quantifies both intra-object stability and inter-object interactions. On this foundation, we develop PhyDPO, a novel direct preference optimization pipeline that leverages contrastive feedback and physics-aware reweighting to guide generation toward physically coherent outputs. Our approach is model-agnostic and scalable, enabling seamless integration into a wide range of video diffusion and transformer-based backbones. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PhysCorr achieves significant improvements in physical realism while preserving visual fidelity and semantic alignment. This work takes a critical step toward physically grounded and trustworthy video generation.</description>

      <title>GNN-MoE: Context-Aware Patch Routing using GNNs for Parameter-Efficient Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) seeks robust Vision Transformer (ViT) performance on unseen domains. Efficiently adapting pretrained ViTs for DG is challenging; standard fine-tuning is costly and can impair generalization. We propose GNN-MoE, enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for DG with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework using efficient Kronecker adapters. Instead of token-based routing, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) router (GCN, GAT, SAGE) operates on inter-patch graphs to dynamically assign patches to specialized experts. This context-aware GNN routing leverages inter-patch relationships for better adaptation to domain shifts. GNN-MoE achieves state-of-the-art or competitive DG benchmark performance with high parameter efficiency, highlighting the utility of graph-based contextual routing for robust, lightweight DG.</description>

      <title>MedDChest: A Content-Aware Multimodal Foundational Vision Model for Thoracic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated, multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10 public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be made publicly available to foster future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Near-Lossless 3D Voxel Representation Free from Iso-surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports 2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring, enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\% improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a representation for 3D learning tasks.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Robust Biometric Authentication from Low-Frame-Rate PPG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in the skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric authentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness detection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal quality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and inter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and classification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective biometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from low-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings from 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The raw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline drift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude normalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG segment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient cardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed CVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects demonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the model to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency, scalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is well-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Deep Semantic Uncertainty Perception for Language-Anchored Multi-modal Vision-Brain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling visual semantics from neural signals such as EEG, MEG, and fMRI remains a fundamental challenge due to subject variability and the entangled nature of visual features. Existing approaches primarily align neural activity directly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to capture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep robustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first end-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain alignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and linguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain representations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned visual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual reliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel uncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during alignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to enhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of single-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M improves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI benchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically surpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task. Code and model are available.</description>

      <title>Adversarial and Score-Based CT Denoising: CycleGAN vs Noise2Score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study CT image denoising in the unpaired and self-supervised regimes by evaluating two strong, training-data-efficient paradigms: a CycleGAN-based residual translator and a Noise2Score (N2S) score-matching denoiser. Under a common evaluation protocol, a configuration sweep identifies a simple standard U-Net backbone within CycleGAN (lambda_cycle = 30, lambda_iden = 2, ngf = ndf = 64) as the most reliable setting; we then train it to convergence with a longer schedule. The selected CycleGAN improves the noisy input from 34.66 dB / 0.9234 SSIM to 38.913 dB / 0.971 SSIM and attains an estimated score of 1.9441 and an unseen-set (Kaggle leaderboard) score of 1.9343. Noise2Score, while slightly behind in absolute PSNR / SSIM, achieves large gains over very noisy inputs, highlighting its utility when clean pairs are unavailable. Overall, CycleGAN offers the strongest final image quality, whereas Noise2Score provides a robust pair-free alternative with competitive performance.

      <title>When Swin Transformer Meets KANs: An Improved Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST</description>

      <title>SpatialLock: Precise Spatial Control in Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However, precise control over object localization in generated images remains a challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information, leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection (PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9 across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Tortoise and Hare Guidance: Accelerating Diffusion Model Inference with Multirate Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free strategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity generation. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance term exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating the classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our error-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust to approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers fail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the computation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with the tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the additional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid. We also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively selects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large extrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up to 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\Delta$ImageReward $\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free accelerators under identical computation budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of multirate formulations for diffusion solvers, paving the way for real-time high-quality image synthesis without any model retraining.

      <title>Text to Sketch Generation with Multi-Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved flexibility in style control.

      <title>DMSORT: An efficient parallel maritime multi-object tracking architecture for unmanned vessel platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective maritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often causes camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant challenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the framework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an object detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated branch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible Columnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to leverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore, a lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to capture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features. Another branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by constructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation within the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories. Finally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines motion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise, occlusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset demonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT attains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while maintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.

      <title>Learning from Online Videos at Inference Time for Computer-Use Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-use agents can operate computers and automate laborious tasks, but despite recent rapid progress, they still lag behind human users, especially when tasks require domain-specific procedural knowledge about particular applications, platforms, and multi-step workflows. Humans can bridge this gap by watching video tutorials: we search, skim, and selectively imitate short segments that match our current subgoal. In this paper, we study how to enable computer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively. We propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts them into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects trajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a VLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions, and assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage selection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context at each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its next decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our framework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use only textual tutorials or transcripts. Analyses highlight the importance of trajectory segmentation and selection, action filtering, and visual information, suggesting that abundant online videos can be systematically distilled into actionable guidance that improves computer-use agents at inference time.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in document understanding, determining the correct orientation of scanned or photographed documents remains a critical pre-processing step in the real world settings. Accurate rotation correction is essential for enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) where misalignment commonly arises due to user errors, particularly incorrect base orientations of the camera during capture. In this study, we first introduce OCR-Rotation-Bench (ORB), a new benchmark for evaluating OCR robustness to image rotations, comprising (i) ORB-En, built from rotation-transformed structured and free-form English OCR datasets, and (ii) ORB-Indic, a novel multilingual set spanning 11 Indic mid to low-resource languages. We also present a fast, robust and lightweight rotation classification pipeline built on the vision encoder of Phi-3.5-Vision model with dynamic image cropping, fine-tuned specifically for 4-class rotation task in a standalone fashion. Our method achieves near-perfect 96% and 92% accuracy on identifying the rotations respectively on both the datasets. Beyond classification, we demonstrate the critical role of our module in boosting OCR performance: closed-source (up to 14%) and open-weights models (up to 4x) in the simulated real-world setting.</description>

      <title>Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method, which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values (AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Covariance Descriptors Meet General Vision Encoders: Riemannian Deep Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features. They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders (GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features. Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>AStF: Motion Style Transfer via Adaptive Statistics Fusor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile, similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator. Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/CHMimilanlan/AStF.</description>

      <title>MedSapiens: Taking a Pose to Rethink Medical Imaging Landmark Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel architecture; instead, it revisits a fundamental yet overlooked baseline: adapting human-centric foundation models for anatomical landmark detection in medical imaging. While landmark detection has traditionally relied on domain-specific models, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained vision models presents new opportunities. In this study, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation model designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset pretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets. Our proposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models, inherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for anatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely untapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81% improvement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR). To further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few annotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving 2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/MedSapiens .</description>

      <title>Proto-LeakNet: Towards Signal-Leak Aware Attribution in Synthetic Human Face Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces, known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining. Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will be available upon submission.</description>

      <title>DINOv2 Driven Gait Representation Learning for Video-Based Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video-based Visible-Infrared person re-identification (VVI-ReID) aims to retrieve the same pedestrian across visible and infrared modalities from video sequences. Existing methods tend to exploit modality-invariant visual features but largely overlook gait features, which are not only modality-invariant but also rich in temporal dynamics, thus limiting their ability to model the spatiotemporal consistency essential for cross-modal video matching. To address these challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning (DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn gait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust sequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Silhouette and Gait Learning (SASGL) model, which generates and enhances silhouette representations with general-purpose semantic priors from DINOv2 and jointly optimizes them with the ReID objective to achieve semantically enriched and task-adaptive gait feature learning. Furthermore, we develop a Progressive Bidirectional Multi-Granularity Enhancement (PBMGE) module, which progressively refines feature representations by enabling bidirectional interactions between gait and appearance streams across multiple spatial granularities, fully leveraging their complementarity to enhance global representations with rich local details and produce highly discriminative features. Extensive experiments on HITSZ-VCM and BUPT datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FastGS: Training 3D Gaussian Splatting in 100 Seconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple, and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &amp; Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a 3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and simultaneous localization and mapping.

      <title>Vision Foundation Models in Agriculture: Toward Domain-Specific Adaptation for Weed Herbicide Trials Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91 to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions (new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance (species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80% fewer labeled samples.
  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial analysis.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based object detection of offshore platforms on Sentinel-1 Imagery and the impact of synthetic training data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent and ongoing expansion of marine infrastructure, including offshore wind farms, oil and gas platforms, artificial islands, and aquaculture facilities, highlights the need for effective monitoring systems. The development of robust models for offshore infrastructure detection relies on comprehensive, balanced datasets, but falls short when samples are scarce, particularly for underrepresented object classes, shapes, and sizes. By training deep learning-based YOLOv10 object detection models with a combination of synthetic and real Sentinel-1 satellite imagery acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023 from four regions (Caspian Sea, South China Sea, Gulf of Guinea, and Coast of Brazil), this study investigates the use of synthetic training data to enhance model performance. We evaluated this approach by applying the model to detect offshore platforms in three unseen regions (Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, Persian Gulf) and thereby assess geographic transferability. This region-holdout evaluation demonstrated that the model generalises beyond the training areas. In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were detected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and 1,593 in the Persian Gulf. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.85, which improved to 0.90 upon incorporating synthetic data. We analysed how synthetic data enhances the representation of unbalanced classes and overall model performance, taking a first step toward globally transferable detection of offshore infrastructure. This study underscores the importance of balanced datasets and highlights synthetic data generation as an effective strategy to address common challenges in remote sensing, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for scalable, global offshore infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>RISE-T2V: Rephrasing and Injecting Semantics with LLM for Expansive Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders for semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when provided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue lies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text encoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions, which limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these challenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of prompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless step instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to various pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module called the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden states during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video generation. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can implicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that better match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful capabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader range of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a versatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model architectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate high-quality videos that align with user intent.

      <title>Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks for Automated 3D Segmentation of Kidneys and Kidney Tumours in Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate delineation of tumours in radiological images like Computed Tomography is a very specialised and time-consuming task, and currently a bottleneck preventing quantitative analyses to be performed routinely in the clinical setting. For this reason, developing methods for the automated segmentation of tumours in medical imaging is of the utmost importance and has driven significant efforts in recent years. However, challenges regarding the impracticality of 3D scans, given the large amount of voxels to be analysed, usually requires the downsampling of such images or using patches thereof when applying traditional convolutional neural networks. To overcome this problem, in this paper we propose a new methodology that uses, divided into two stages, voxel sparsification and submanifold sparse convolutional networks. This method allows segmentations to be performed with high-resolution inputs and a native 3D model architecture, obtaining state-of-the-art accuracies while significantly reducing the computational resources needed in terms of GPU memory and time. We studied the deployment of this methodology in the context of Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients from the KiTS23 challenge, and our method achieved results competitive with the challenge winners, with Dice similarity coefficients of 95.8% for kidneys + masses, 85.7% for tumours + cysts, and 80.3% for tumours alone. Crucially, our method also offers significant computational improvements, achieving up to a 60% reduction in inference time and up to a 75\% reduction in VRAM usage compared to an equivalent dense architecture, across both CPU and various GPU cards tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of nine convolutional neural network architectures for binary classification of horses and motorcycles in the VOC 2008 dataset. We address the significant class imbalance problem by implementing minority-class augmentation techniques. Our experiments compare modern architectures including ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, DenseNet-121, and Vision Transformer across multiple performance metrics. Results demonstrate substantial performance variations, with ConvNeXt-Tiny achieving the highest Average Precision (AP) of 95.53% for horse detection and 89.12% for motorcycle detection. We observe that data augmentation significantly improves minority class detection, particularly benefiting deeper architectures. This study provides insights into architecture selection for imbalanced binary classification tasks and quantifies the impact of data augmentation strategies in mitigating class imbalance issues in object detection.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Weather-Induced Sensor Occlusion on BEVFusion for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate safely in complex real-world environments. Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset. Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%), with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1% drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8% drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or degradation due to adverse environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>A MATLAB tutorial on deep feature extraction combined with chemometrics for analytical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities, enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured, step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models to extract deep features from imaging data.
  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations, showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Learning for Visually Grounded Reasoning in Gastrointestinal VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-task framework for the MediaEval Medico 2025 challenge, leveraging a LoRA-tuned Florence-2 model for simultaneous visual question answering (VQA), explanation generation, and visual grounding. The proposed system integrates three curated datasets: (1) Kvasir-VQA-x1 for question-answer learning, (2) a synthetically enriched explanation dataset offering structured medical reasoning, and (3) text-to-region pairs linking visual features with segmentation masks. This multi-task setup enables the model to jointly learn visual grounding, reasoning, and interpretation, producing responses that are both accurate and interpretable. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach substantially improves over single-task baselines in both answer accuracy and visual localization, highlighting the effectiveness of grounded multi-task learning for medical VQA applications.</description>

      <title>BoRe-Depth: Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Boundary Refinement for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth estimation is one of the key technologies for realizing 3D perception in unmanned systems. Monocular depth estimation has been widely researched because of its low-cost advantage, but the existing methods face the challenges of poor depth estimation performance and blurred object boundaries on embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation model, BoRe-Depth, which contains only 8.7M parameters. It can accurately estimate depth maps on embedded systems and significantly improves boundary quality. Firstly, we design an Enhanced Feature Adaptive Fusion Module (EFAF) which adaptively fuses depth features to enhance boundary detail representation. Secondly, we integrate semantic knowledge into the encoder to improve the object recognition and boundary perception capabilities. Finally, BoRe-Depth is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, and runs efficiently at 50.7 FPS. We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous lightweight models on multiple challenging datasets, and we provide detailed ablation studies for the proposed methods. The code is available at https://github.com/liangxiansheng093/BoRe-Depth.</description>

      <title>HideAndSeg: an AI-based tool with automated prompting for octopus segmentation in natural habitats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their camouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body deformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable underwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated datasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised AI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative baseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained YOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate the initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data for the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by providing a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further manual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal consistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively evaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of ground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate, and test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory performance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted approach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods of complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually prompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world scenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more efficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.</description>

      <title>Solving Convex Partition Visual Jigsaw Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image, and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles, severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex. We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark dataset of such puzzles.</description>

      <title>V-Thinker: Interactive Thinking with Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs. To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1) a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing image-interactive reasoning applications.</description>

      <title>Landslide Hazard Mapping with Geospatial Foundation Models: Geographical Generalizability, Data Scarcity, and Band Adaptability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment, making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining, self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>THEval. Evaluation Framework for Talking Head Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics, evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8 metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii) synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by 17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress in the field.</description>

      <title>Learning from Single Timestamps: Complexity Estimation in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate assessment of surgical complexity is essential in Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), where severe inflammation is associated with longer operative times and increased risk of postoperative complications. The Parkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for stratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos remains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete videos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work, we introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity estimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal supervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed clips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal localization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading module. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft localization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results: Evaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy of 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by over 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision for surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable and effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation from full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and surgical training.</description>

      <title>Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal Reasoning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1) Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration, we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks, Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU. Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model, positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.</description>

      <title>UniSplat: Unified Spatio-Temporal Fusion via 3D Latent Scaffolds for Dynamic Driving Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly, yet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse, non-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a general feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction through unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent scaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic scene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively integrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an efficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold, enabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed reconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware Gaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with voxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to enable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust and high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera coverage.</description>

      <title>PixCLIP: Achieving Fine-grained Visual Language Understanding via Any-granularity Pixel-Text Alignment Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved remarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding tasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains an active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy of explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing, e.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local regions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual descriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language alignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder fundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded in long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing both visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a novel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and process lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an automated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized, long-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we construct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million samples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and propose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating fine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP showcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form texts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution, we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels. Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate translation towards routine use by pathologists.</description>

      <title>NovisVQ: A Streaming Convolutional Neural Network for No-Reference Opinion-Unaware Frame Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is vital for computer vision tasks, but existing approaches face major limitations: full-reference (FR) metrics require clean reference videos, and most no-reference (NR) models depend on training on costly human opinion labels. Moreover, most opinion-unaware NR methods are image-based, ignoring temporal context critical for video object detection. In this work, we present a scalable, streaming-based VQA model that is both no-reference and opinion-unaware. Our model leverages synthetic degradations of the DAVIS dataset, training a temporal-aware convolutional architecture to predict FR metrics (LPIPS , PSNR, SSIM) directly from degraded video, without references at inference. We show that our streaming approach outperforms our own image-based baseline by generalizing across diverse degradations, underscoring the value of temporal modeling for scalable VQA in real-world vision systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model achieves higher correlation with full-reference metrics compared to BRISQUE, a widely-used opinion-aware image quality assessment baseline, validating the effectiveness of our temporal, opinion-unaware approach.</description>

      <title>Polarization-resolved imaging improves eye tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization-resolved near-infrared imaging adds a useful optical contrast mechanism to eye tracking by measuring the polarization state of light reflected by ocular tissues in addition to its intensity. In this paper we demonstrate how this contrast can be used to enable eye tracking. Specifically, we demonstrate that a polarization-enabled eye tracking (PET) system composed of a polarization--filter--array camera paired with a linearly polarized near-infrared illuminator can reveal trackable features across the sclera and gaze-informative patterns on the cornea, largely absent in intensity-only images. Across a cohort of 346 participants, convolutional neural network based machine learning models trained on data from PET reduced the median 95th-percentile absolute gaze error by 10--16\% relative to capacity-matched intensity baselines under nominal conditions and in the presence of eyelid occlusions, eye-relief changes, and pupil-size variation. These results link light--tissue polarization effects to practical gains in human--computer interaction and position PET as a simple, robust sensing modality for future wearable devices.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Designers Should "Train on the Test Set" to Expose Exploitable Non-Visual Shortcuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without strong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and superficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric benchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic principle for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be. Designers should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using diagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate non-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test set'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.
  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose benchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology. Our primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language Model via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual inputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a bias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based diagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing. Second, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an ``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four benchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive non-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create VSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider vision-blind performance gap than the original.</description>

      <title>SIMS-V: Simulated Instruction-Tuning for Spatial Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite impressive high-level video comprehension, multimodal language models struggle with spatial reasoning across time and space. While current spatial training approaches rely on real-world video data, obtaining diverse footage with precise spatial annotations remains a bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present SIMS-V -- a systematic data-generation framework that leverages the privileged information of 3D simulators to create spatially-rich video training data for multimodal language models. Using this framework, we investigate which properties of simulated data drive effective real-world transfer through systematic ablations of question types, mixes, and scales. We identify a minimal set of three question categories (metric measurement, perspective-dependent reasoning, and temporal tracking) that prove most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, outperforming comprehensive coverage despite using fewer question types. These insights enable highly efficient training: our 7B-parameter video LLM fine-tuned on just 25K simulated examples outperforms the larger 72B baseline and achieves competitive performance with proprietary models on rigorous real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates robust generalization, maintaining performance on general video understanding while showing substantial improvements on embodied and real-world spatial tasks.</description>

      <title>Cambrian-S: Towards Spatial Supersensing in Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from reactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader paradigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond linguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen), streaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences), implicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and predictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize information). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering narrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that require true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we present VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial recall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require arbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context expansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training Cambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without sacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited, indicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We propose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in which a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise (prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this approach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that spatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate, select, and organize experience.</description>

      <title>InfinityStar: Unified Spacetime AutoRegressive Modeling for Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InfinityStar, a unified spacetime autoregressive framework for high-resolution image and dynamic video synthesis. Building on the recent success of autoregressive modeling in both vision and language, our purely discrete approach jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies within a single architecture. This unified design naturally supports a variety of generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, and long interactive video synthesis via straightforward temporal autoregression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfinityStar scores 83.74 on VBench, outperforming all autoregressive models by large margins, even surpassing some diffusion competitors like HunyuanVideo. Without extra optimizations, our model generates a 5s, 720p video approximately 10x faster than leading diffusion-based methods. To our knowledge, InfinityStar is the first discrete autoregressive video generator capable of producing industrial level 720p videos. We release all code and models to foster further research in efficient, high-quality video generation.</description>

      <title>Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics. However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects through transformations while detecting and describing state changes, accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time. TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then, it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional results, and the benchmark dataset are available at https://tubelet-graph.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic image cropping is a method for maximizing the human-perceived quality of cropped regions in photographs. Although several works have proposed techniques for producing singular crops, little work has addressed the problem of producing multiple, distinct crops with aesthetic appeal. In this paper, we motivate the problem with a discussion on modern social media applications, introduce a dataset of 277 relevant images and human labels, and evaluate the efficacy of several single-crop models with an image partitioning algorithm as a pre-processing step. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RafeLoya/carousel.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network deep learning method for model class selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response-only model class selection capability of a novel deep convolutional neural network method is examined herein in a simple, yet effective, manner. Specifically, the responses from a unique degree of freedom along with their class information train and validate a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. In doing so, the network selects the model class of new and unlabeled signals without the need of the system input information, or full system identification. An optional physics-based algorithm enhancement is also examined using the Kalman filter to fuse the system response signals using the kinematics constraints of the acceleration and displacement data. Importantly, the method is shown to select the model class in slight signal variations attributed to the damping behavior or hysteresis behavior on both linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, as well as on a 3D building finite element model, providing a powerful tool for structural health monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>What's in Common? Multimodal Models Hallucinate When Reasoning Across Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models possess a remarkable ability to handle an open-vocabulary's worth of objects. Yet the best models still suffer from hallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap between their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks that are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap, we build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With more than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training data to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by cognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking "what's in common?". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models specifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that perceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning across scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning models. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best performing model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex, consisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously, we find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present in the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen during training. Among the models we evaluated, we found scale can provide modest improvements while models explicitly trained with multi-image inputs show bigger improvements, suggesting scaled multi-image training may offer promise. We make our benchmark publicly available to spur research into the challenge of hallucination when reasoning across scenes.</description>

      <title>Computed Tomography (CT)-derived Cardiovascular Flow Estimation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks Improves with Sinogram-based Training: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a critical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate cardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow velocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.
  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved framework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.
  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel bifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with varying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings. We compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed images (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.
  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by avoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was robust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower mean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow was compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with shorter pulse widths.
  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based flow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood flow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT images and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable acquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.</description>

      <title>Shape Deformation Networks for Automated Aortic Valve Finite Element Meshing from 3D CT Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is essential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess valve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to generate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across different patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with irregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and inconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline with deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral) meshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing aortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a uniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element correspondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the learning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function with only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness regularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and element quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach produces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and shape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to the traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad meshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh correspondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.</description>

      <title>GraSP-VLA: Graph-based Symbolic Action Representation for Long-Horizon Planning with VLA Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04357</link>

Abstract: Deploying autonomous robots that can learn new skills from demonstrations is an important challenge of modern robotics. Existing solutions often apply end-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or symbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current VLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which hinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic approaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this paper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that uses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic representation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate new planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for low-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced in a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic representations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from observations. In addition, results on real-world experiments show the potential of our Continuous Scene Graph representation to orchestrate low-level VLA policies in long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Regression and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even though the margin maximization term $\|w\|$ is used in support vector regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear regressor is adequate.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Aware Tensor Decomposition for Compression of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are widely used for image-related tasks but typically demand considerable computing power. Once a network has been trained, however, its memory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we focus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations. Whereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing an isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use data-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we minimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed as $\lVert (W - \widetilde{W}) \Sigma^{1/2}\rVert_F$ where $\Sigma^{1/2}$ is the square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$, $\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new alternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor decompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike conventional compression pipelines, which almost always require post-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves competitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same covariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only a minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training dataset is unavailable. Experiments on several CNN architectures (ResNet-18/50, and GoogLeNet) and datasets (ImageNet, FGVC-Aircraft, Cifar10, and Cifar100) confirm the advantages of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>$\mu$NeuFMT: Optical-Property-Adaptive Fluorescence Molecular Tomography via Implicit Neural Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction, eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth). Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.</description>

      <title>Evo-1: Lightweight Vision-Language-Action Model with Preserved Semantic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful framework that unifies perception, language, and control, enabling robots to perform diverse tasks through multimodal understanding. However, current VLA models typically contain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data pretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as limited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training paradigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language backbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks. In this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces computation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong performance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native multimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated diffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together forming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the representations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1 achieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite, surpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also attains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO. In real-world evaluations, Evo-1 attains a 78% success rate with high inference frequency and low memory overhead, outperforming all baseline methods. We release code, data, and model weights to facilitate future research on lightweight and efficient VLA models.</description>

      <title>Jr. AI Scientist and Its Risk Report: Autonomous Scientific Exploration from a Baseline Paper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end, we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations, formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science, a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI Scientist development.</description>

      <title>Real-to-Sim Robot Policy Evaluation with Gaussian Splatting Simulation of Soft-Body Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots, objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing, demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies. Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation of robotic manipulation policies.

      <title>X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that are physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences, human demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and interact with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion process: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade while high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a principled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages human data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first trains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or robot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after adding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment. Actions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low noise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at higher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under execution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion consistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves a 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website is available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.</description>

      <title>GentleHumanoid: Learning Upper-body Compliance for Contact-rich Human and Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically restricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme forces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a framework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking policy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based formulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing against surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human motion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse interaction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable force thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the Unitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance, including gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object manipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak contact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more natural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots that can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Practical solutions to the relative pose of three calibrated cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16078v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the challenging problem of estimating the relative pose of three calibrated cameras from four point correspondences. We propose novel efficient solutions to this problem that are based on the simple idea of using four correspondences to estimate an approximate geometry of the first two views. We model this geometry either as an affine or a fully perspective geometry estimated using one additional approximate correspondence. We generate such an approximate correspondence using a very simple and efficient strategy, where the new point is the mean point of three corresponding input points. The new solvers are efficient and easy to implement, since they are based on existing efficient minimal solvers, i.e., the 4-point affine fundamental matrix, the well-known 5-point relative pose solver, and the P3P solver. Extensive experiments on real data show that the proposed solvers, when properly coupled with local optimization, achieve state-of-the-art results, with the novel solver based on approximate mean-point correspondences being more robust and accurate than the affine-based solver.</description>

      <title>Bridging Generative and Discriminative Noisy-Label Learning via Direction-Agnostic EM Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although noisy-label learning is often approached with discriminative methods for simplicity and speed, generative modeling offers a principled alternative by capturing the joint mechanism that produces features, clean labels, and corrupted observations. However, prior work typically (i) introduces extra latent variables and heavy image generators that bias training toward reconstruction, (ii) fixes a single data-generating direction (\(Y\rightarrow\!X\) or \(X\rightarrow\!Y\)), limiting adaptability, and (iii) assumes a uniform prior over clean labels, ignoring instance-level uncertainty. We propose a single-stage, EM-style framework for generative noisy-label learning that is \emph{direction-agnostic} and avoids explicit image synthesis. First, we derive a single Expectation-Maximization (EM) objective whose E-step specializes to either causal orientation without changing the overall optimization. Second, we replace the intractable \(p(X\mid Y)\) with a dataset-normalized discriminative proxy computed using a discriminative classifier on the finite training set, retaining the structural benefits of generative modeling at much lower cost. Third, we introduce \emph{Partial-Label Supervision} (PLS), an instance-specific prior over clean labels that balances coverage and uncertainty, improving data-dependent regularization. Across standard vision and natural language processing (NLP) noisy-label benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, lower transition-matrix estimation error, and substantially less training compute than current generative and discriminative baselines.

      <title>Robust Self-calibration of Focal Lengths from the Fundamental Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of self-calibration of two cameras from a given fundamental matrix is one of the basic problems in geometric computer vision. Under the assumption of known principal points and square pixels, the well-known Bougnoux formula offers a means to compute the two unknown focal lengths. However, in many practical situations, the formula yields inaccurate results due to commonly occurring singularities. Moreover, the estimates are sensitive to noise in the computed fundamental matrix and to the assumed positions of the principal points. In this paper, we therefore propose an efficient and robust iterative method to estimate the focal lengths along with the principal points of the cameras given a fundamental matrix and priors for the estimated camera parameters. In addition, we study a computationally efficient check of models generated within RANSAC that improves the accuracy of the estimated models while reducing the total computational time. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show that our iterative method brings significant improvements in terms of the accuracy of the estimated focal lengths over the Bougnoux formula and other state-of-the-art methods, even when relying on inaccurate priors.</description>

Abstract: Visual odometry estimates the motion of a moving camera based on visual input. Existing methods, mostly focusing on two-view point tracking, often ignore the rich temporal context in the image sequence, thereby overlooking the global motion patterns and providing no assessment of the full trajectory reliability. These shortcomings hinder performance in scenarios with occlusion, dynamic objects, and low-texture areas. To address these challenges, we present the Long-term Effective Any Point Tracking (LEAP) module. LEAP innovatively combines visual, inter-track, and temporal cues with mindfully selected anchors for dynamic track estimation. Moreover, LEAP's temporal probabilistic formulation integrates distribution updates into a learnable iterative refinement module to reason about point-wise uncertainty. Based on these traits, we develop LEAP-VO, a robust visual odometry system adept at handling occlusions and dynamic scenes. Our mindful integration showcases a novel practice by employing long-term point tracking as the front-end. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms existing baselines across various visual odometry benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Revealing the structure-property relationships of copper alloys with FAGC</title>

Abstract: Cu-Cr-Zr alloys play a crucial role in electronic devices and the electric power industry, where their electrical conductivity and hardness are of great importance. However, due to the scarcity of available samples, there has been a lack of effective studies exploring the relationship between the microstructural images of Cu-Cr-Zr alloys and their key properties. In this paper, the FAGC feature augmentation method is employed to enhance the microstructural images of Cu-Cr-Zr alloys within a feature space known as the pre-shape space. Pseudo-labels are then constructed to expand the number of training samples. These features are then input into various machine learning models to construct performance prediction models for the alloy. Finally, we validate the impact of different machine learning methods and the number of augmented features on prediction accuracy through experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in predicting electrical conductivity (\(R^2=0.978\)) and hardness (\(R^2=0.998\)) when using the decision tree classifier with 100 augmented samples. Further analysis reveals that regions with reduced image noise, such as fewer grain or phase boundaries, exhibit higher contributions to electrical conductivity. These findings highlight the potential of the FAGC method in overcoming the challenges of limited image data in materials science, offering a powerful tool for establishing detailed and quantitative relationships between complex microstructures and material properties.</description>

      <title>EMHI: A Multimodal Egocentric Human Motion Dataset with HMD and Body-Worn IMUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Egocentric human pose estimation (HPE) using wearable sensors is essential for VR/AR applications. Most methods rely solely on either egocentric-view images or sparse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, leading to inaccuracies due to self-occlusion in images or the sparseness and drift of inertial sensors. Most importantly, the lack of real-world datasets containing both modalities is a major obstacle to progress in this field. To overcome the barrier, we propose EMHI, a multimodal \textbf{E}gocentric human \textbf{M}otion dataset with \textbf{H}ead-Mounted Display (HMD) and body-worn \textbf{I}MUs, with all data collected under the real VR product suite. Specifically, EMHI provides synchronized stereo images from downward-sloping cameras on the headset and IMU data from body-worn sensors, along with pose annotations in SMPL format. This dataset consists of 885 sequences captured by 58 subjects performing 39 actions, totaling about 28.5 hours of recording. We evaluate the annotations by comparing them with optical marker-based SMPL fitting results. To substantiate the reliability of our dataset, we introduce MEPoser, a new baseline method for multimodal egocentric HPE, which employs a multimodal fusion encoder, temporal feature encoder, and MLP-based regression heads. The experiments on EMHI show that MEPoser outperforms existing single-modal methods and demonstrates the value of our dataset in solving the problem of egocentric HPE. We believe the release of EMHI and the method could advance the research of egocentric HPE and expedite the practical implementation of this technology in VR/AR products.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Stereo Inputs: A Solution to the Occlusion Challenge in Self-Supervised Stereo Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised stereo matching holds great promise by eliminating the reliance on expensive ground-truth data. Its dominant paradigm, based on photometric consistency, is however fundamentally hindered by the occlusion challenge -- an issue that persists regardless of network architecture. The essential insight is that for any occluders, valid feedback signals can only be derived from the unoccluded areas on one side of the occluder. Existing methods attempt to address this by focusing on the erroneous feedback from the other side, either by identifying and removing it, or by introducing additional regularities for correction on that basis. Nevertheless, these approaches have failed to provide a complete solution. This work proposes a more fundamental solution. The core idea is to transform the fixed state of one-sided valid and one-sided erroneous signals into a probabilistic acquisition of valid feedback from both sides of an occluder. This is achieved through a complete framework, centered on a pseudo-stereo inputs strategy that decouples the input and feedback, without introducing any additional constraints. Qualitative results visually demonstrate that the occlusion problem is resolved, manifested by fully symmetrical and identical performance on both flanks of occluding objects. Quantitative experiments thoroughly validate the significant performance improvements resulting from solving the occlusion challenge.</description>

      <title>Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Enhanced Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their immense success, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be difficult to optimize and costly to train due to hundreds of layers within the network depth. Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.</description>

      <title>Are Minimal Radial Distortion Solvers Necessary for Relative Pose Estimation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the relative pose between two cameras is a fundamental step in many applications such as Structure-from-Motion. The common approach to relative pose estimation is to apply a minimal solver inside a RANSAC loop. Highly efficient solvers exist for pinhole cameras. Yet, (nearly) all cameras exhibit radial distortion. Not modeling radial distortion leads to (significantly) worse results. However, minimal radial distortion solvers are significantly more complex than pinhole solvers, both in terms of run-time and implementation efforts. This paper compares radial distortion solvers with a simple-to-implement approach that combines an efficient pinhole solver with sampled radial distortion parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and RANSAC variants show that this simple approach performs similarly or better than the most accurate minimal distortion solvers at faster run-times while being significantly more accurate than faster non-minimal solvers. We clearly show that complex radial distortion solvers are not necessary in practice. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/kocurvik/rd.</description>

      <title>Three-view Focal Length Recovery From Homographies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recovering focal lengths from three-view homographies. By examining the consistency of normal vectors between two homographies, we derive new explicit constraints between the focal lengths and homographies using an elimination technique. We demonstrate that three-view homographies provide two additional constraints, enabling the recovery of one or two focal lengths. We discuss four possible cases, including three cameras having an unknown equal focal length, three cameras having two different unknown focal lengths, three cameras where one focal length is known, and the other two cameras have equal or different unknown focal lengths. All the problems can be converted into solving polynomials in one or two unknowns, which can be efficiently solved using Sturm sequence or hidden variable technique. Evaluation using both synthetic and real data shows that the proposed solvers are both faster and more accurate than methods relying on existing two-view solvers.

      <title>Optimized Minimal 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for real-time, high-performance rendering, enabling a wide range of applications. However, representing 3D scenes with numerous explicit Gaussian primitives imposes significant storage and memory overhead. Recent studies have shown that high-quality rendering can be achieved with a substantially reduced number of Gaussians when represented with high-precision attributes. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS compression methods still rely on a relatively large number of Gaussians, focusing primarily on attribute compression. This is because a smaller set of Gaussians becomes increasingly sensitive to lossy attribute compression, leading to severe quality degradation. Since the number of Gaussians is directly tied to computational costs, it is essential to reduce the number of Gaussians effectively rather than only optimizing storage. In this paper, we propose Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (OMG), which significantly reduces storage while using a minimal number of primitives. First, we determine the distinct Gaussian from the near ones, minimizing redundancy without sacrificing quality. Second, we propose a compact and precise attribute representation that efficiently captures both continuity and irregularity among primitives. Additionally, we propose a sub-vector quantization technique for improved irregularity representation, maintaining fast training with a negligible codebook size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMG reduces storage requirements by nearly 50% compared to the previous state-of-the-art and enables 600+ FPS rendering while maintaining high rendering quality.

      <title>What Time Tells Us? An Explorative Study of Time Awareness Learned from Static Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time becomes visible through illumination changes in what we see. Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: *what time tells us?* To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing. Our findings suggest that time-related visual cues can be learned from static images and are beneficial for various vision tasks, laying a foundation for future research on understanding time-related visual context.

      <title>CFReID: Continual Few-shot Person Re-Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world surveillance systems are dynamically evolving, requiring a person Re-identification model to continuously handle newly incoming data from various domains. To cope with these dynamics, Lifelong ReID (LReID) has been proposed to learn and accumulate knowledge across multiple domains incrementally. However, LReID models need to be trained on large-scale labeled data for each unseen domain, which are typically inaccessible due to privacy and cost concerns. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Continual Few-shot ReID (CFReID), which requires models to be incrementally trained using few-shot data and tested on all seen domains. Under few-shot conditions, CFREID faces two core challenges: 1) learning knowledge from few-shot data of unseen domain, and 2) avoiding catastrophic forgetting of seen domains. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a Stable Distribution Alignment (SDA) framework from feature distribution perspective. Specifically, our SDA is composed of two modules, i.e., Meta Distribution Alignment (MDA) and Prototype-based Few-shot Adaptation (PFA). To support the study of CFReID, we establish an evaluation benchmark for CFReID on five publicly available ReID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SDA can enhance the few-shot learning and anti-forgetting capabilities under few-shot conditions. Notably, our approach, using only 5\% of the data, i.e., 32 IDs, significantly outperforms LReID's state-of-the-art performance, which requires 700 to 1,000 IDs.</description>

Abstract: Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing requires an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.</description>

      <title>RadZero: Similarity-Based Cross-Attention for Explainable Vision-Language Alignment in Chest X-ray with Zero-Shot Multi-Task Capability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal models have significantly improved vision-language (VL) alignment in radiology. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively utilize complex radiology reports for learning and offer limited interpretability through attention probability visualizations. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{RadZero}$, a novel framework for VL alignment in chest X-ray with zero-shot multi-task capability. A key component of our approach is $\textbf{VL-CABS}$ ($\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{A}$ttention $\textbf{B}$ased on $\textbf{S}$imilarity), which aligns text embeddings with local image features for interpretable, fine-grained VL reasoning. RadZero leverages large language models to extract concise semantic sentences from radiology reports and employs multi-positive contrastive training to effectively capture relationships between images and multiple relevant textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained vision encoder with additional trainable Transformer layers, allowing efficient high-resolution image processing. By computing similarity between text embeddings and local image patch features, VL-CABS enables zero-shot inference with similarity probability for classification, and pixel-level VL similarity maps for grounding and segmentation. Experimental results on public chest radiograph benchmarks show that RadZero outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification, grounding, and segmentation. Furthermore, VL similarity map analysis highlights the potential of VL-CABS for improving explainability in VL alignment. Additionally, qualitative evaluation demonstrates RadZero's capability for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, further validating its effectiveness in medical imaging.

      <title>EarthGPT-X: A Spatial MLLM for Multi-level Multi-Source Remote Sensing Imagery Understanding with Visual Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural-domain multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated effective spatial reasoning through visual and textual prompting. However, their direct transfer to remote sensing (RS) is hindered by heterogeneous sensing physics, diverse modalities, and unique spatial scales. Existing RS MLLMs are mainly limited to optical imagery and plain language interaction, preventing flexible and scalable real-world applications. In this article, EarthGPT-X is proposed, the first flexible spatial MLLM that unifies multi-source RS imagery comprehension and accomplishes both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual tasks under diverse visual prompts in a single framework. Distinct from prior models, EarthGPT-X introduces: 1) a dual-prompt mechanism combining text instructions with various visual prompts (i.e., point, box, and free-form) to mimic the versatility of referring in human life; 2) a comprehensive multi-source multi-level prompting dataset, the model advances beyond holistic image understanding to support hierarchical spatial reasoning, including scene-level understanding and fine-grained object attributes and relational analysis; 3) a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy, enabling efficient and consistent alignment across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthGPT-X substantially outperforms prior nature and RS MLLMs, establishing the first framework capable of multi-source, multi-task, and multi-level interpretation using visual prompting in RS scenarios.</description>

      <title>Back on Track: Bundle Adjustment for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional SLAM systems, which rely on bundle adjustment, struggle with highly dynamic scenes commonly found in casual videos. Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic elements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM -- bundle adjustment -- with a robust learning-based 3D tracker front-end. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks the camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements. Our experiments on challenging datasets reveal significant improvements in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Deepfake technology poses increasing risks such as privacy invasion and identity theft. To address these threats, we propose WaveGuard, a proactive watermarking framework that enhances robustness and imperceptibility via frequency-domain embedding and graph-based structural consistency. Specifically, we embed watermarks into high-frequency sub-bands using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DT-CWT) and employ a Structural Consistency Graph Neural Network (SC-GNN) to preserve visual quality. We also design an attention module to refine embedding precision. Experimental results on face swap and reenactment tasks demonstrate that WaveGuard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both robustness and visual quality.

      <title>Revisiting Residual Connections: Orthogonal Updates for Stable and Efficient Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual connections are pivotal for deep neural networks, enabling greater depth by mitigating vanishing gradients. However, in standard residual updates, the module's output is directly added to the input stream. This can lead to updates that predominantly reinforce or modulate the existing stream direction, potentially underutilizing the module's capacity for learning entirely novel features. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal Residual Update: we decompose the module's output relative to the input stream and add only the component orthogonal to this stream. This design aims to guide modules to contribute primarily new representational directions, fostering richer feature learning while promoting more efficient training. We demonstrate that our orthogonal update strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across diverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs, TinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +3.78 pp top-1 accuracy gain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.</description>

      <title>DOVE: Efficient One-Step Diffusion Model for Real-World Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated promising performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the dozens of sampling steps they require, make inference extremely slow. Sampling acceleration techniques, particularly single-step, provide a potential solution. Nonetheless, achieving one step in VSR remains challenging, due to the high training overhead on video data and stringent fidelity demands. To tackle the above issues, we propose DOVE, an efficient one-step diffusion model for real-world VSR. DOVE is obtained by fine-tuning a pretrained video diffusion model (i.e., CogVideoX). To effectively train DOVE, we introduce the latent-pixel training strategy. The strategy employs a two-stage scheme to gradually adapt the model to the video super-resolution task. Meanwhile, we design a video processing pipeline to construct a high-quality dataset tailored for VSR, termed HQ-VSR. Fine-tuning on this dataset further enhances the restoration capability of DOVE. Extensive experiments show that DOVE exhibits comparable or superior performance to multi-step diffusion-based VSR methods. It also offers outstanding inference efficiency, achieving up to a 28$\times$ speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR.

      <title>Two Causally Related Needles in a Video Haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properly evaluating the ability of Video-Language Models (VLMs) to understand long videos remains a challenge. We propose a long-context video understanding benchmark, Causal2Needles, that assesses two crucial abilities insufficiently addressed by existing benchmarks: (1) extracting information from two separate locations (two needles) in a long video and understanding them jointly, and (2) modeling the world in terms of cause and effect in human behaviors. Causal2Needles evaluates these abilities using noncausal one-needle, causal one-needle, and causal two-needle questions. The most complex question type, causal two-needle questions, require extracting information from both the cause and effect events from a long video and the associated narration text. To prevent textual bias, we introduce two complementary question formats: locating the video clip containing the answer, and verbal description of a visual detail from that video clip. Our experiments reveal that models excelling on existing benchmarks struggle with causal 2-needle questions, and the model performance is negatively correlated with the distance between the two needles. These findings highlight critical limitations in current VLMs. The dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/causal2needles/Causal2Needles</description>

      <title>MMPerspective: Do MLLMs Understand Perspective? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems.

      <title>TextRegion: Text-Aligned Region Tokens from Frozen Image-Text Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-text models excel at image-level tasks but struggle with detailed visual understanding. While these models provide strong visual-language alignment, segmentation models like SAM2 offer precise spatial boundaries for objects. To this end, we propose TextRegion, a simple, effective, and training-free framework that combines the strengths of image-text models and SAM2 to generate powerful text-aligned region tokens. These tokens enable detailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities. They can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world semantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We conduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods. Additionally, our framework is compatible with many image-text models, making it highly practical and easily extensible as stronger models emerge.

      <title>UMA: Ultra-detailed Human Avatars via Multi-level Surface Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this, we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers, which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over 10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras, featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of the art.</description>

      <title>MIND: Material Interface Generation from UDFs for Non-Manifold Surface Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) are widely used in 3D deep learning due to their ability to represent shapes with arbitrary topology. While prior work has largely focused on learning UDFs from point clouds or multi-view images, extracting meshes from UDFs remains challenging, as the learned fields rarely attain exact zero distances. A common workaround is to reconstruct signed distance fields (SDFs) locally from UDFs to enable surface extraction via Marching Cubes. However, this often introduces topological artifacts such as holes or spurious components. Moreover, local SDFs are inherently incapable of representing non-manifold geometry, leading to complete failure in such cases. To address this gap, we propose MIND (Material Interface from Non-manifold Distance fields), a novel algorithm for generating material interfaces directly from UDFs, enabling non-manifold mesh extraction from a global perspective. The core of our method lies in deriving a meaningful spatial partitioning from the UDF, where the target surface emerges as the interface between distinct regions. We begin by computing a two-signed local field to distinguish the two sides of manifold patches, and then extend this to a multi-labeled global field capable of separating all sides of a non-manifold structure. By combining this multi-labeled field with the input UDF, we construct material interfaces that support non-manifold mesh extraction via a multi-labeled Marching Cubes algorithm. Extensive experiments on UDFs generated from diverse data sources, including point cloud reconstruction, multi-view reconstruction, and medial axis transforms, demonstrate that our approach robustly handles complex non-manifold surfaces and significantly outperforms existing methods.

      <title>HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling for Vision-Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, \textbf{HoliSafe}, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation (HoliSafe-Bench). We further propose a novel modular framework for enhancing VLM safety with a visual guard module (VGM) designed to assess the harmfulness of input images for VLMs. This module endows VLMs with a dual functionality: they not only learn to generate safer responses but can also provide an interpretable harmfulness classification to justify their refusal decisions. A significant advantage of this approach is its modularity; the VGM is designed as a plug-in component, allowing for seamless integration with diverse pre-trained VLMs across various scales. Experiments show that Safe-VLM with VGM, trained on our HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe-Bench itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing VLM models. We hope that HoliSafe and VGM will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, current VLA models often struggle with physically infeasible action outputs, complex model structures, or unnecessarily long reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoVLA, a novel VLA model that unifies reasoning and action generation within a single autoregressive generation model for end-to-end autonomous driving. AutoVLA performs semantic reasoning and trajectory planning directly from raw visual inputs and language instructions. We tokenize continuous trajectories into discrete, feasible actions, enabling direct integration into the language model. For training, we employ supervised fine-tuning to equip the model with dual thinking modes: fast thinking (trajectory-only) and slow thinking (enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning). To further enhance planning performance and efficiency, we introduce a reinforcement fine-tuning method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), reducing unnecessary reasoning in straightforward scenarios. Extensive experiments across real-world and simulated datasets and benchmarks, including nuPlan, nuScenes, Waymo, and CARLA, demonstrate the competitive performance of AutoVLA in both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Qualitative results showcase the adaptive reasoning and accurate planning capabilities of AutoVLA in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advanced Sign Language Video Generation with Compressed and Quantized Multi-Condition Tokenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sign Language Video Generation (SLVG) seeks to generate identity-preserving sign language videos from spoken language texts. Existing methods primarily rely on the single coarse condition (\eg, skeleton sequences) as the intermediary to bridge the translation model and the video generation model, which limits both the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose SignViP, a novel SLVG framework that incorporates multiple fine-grained conditions for improved generation fidelity. Rather than directly translating error-prone high-dimensional conditions, SignViP adopts a discrete tokenization paradigm to integrate and represent fine-grained conditions (\ie, fine-grained poses and 3D hands). SignViP contains three core components. (1) Sign Video Diffusion Model is jointly trained with a multi-condition encoder to learn continuous embeddings that encapsulate fine-grained motion and appearance. (2) Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) Autoencoder is further trained to compress and quantize these embeddings into discrete tokens for compact representation of the conditions. (3) Multi-Condition Token Translator is trained to translate spoken language text to discrete multi-condition tokens. During inference, Multi-Condition Token Translator first translates the spoken language text into discrete multi-condition tokens. These tokens are then decoded to continuous embeddings by FSQ Autoencoder, which are subsequently injected into Sign Video Diffusion Model to guide video generation. Experimental results show that SignViP achieves state-of-the-art performance across metrics, including video quality, temporal coherence, and semantic fidelity. The code is available at https://github.com/umnooob/signvip/.</description>

      <title>Seeing What Matters: Generalizable AI-generated Video Detection with Forensic-Oriented Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can produce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors have been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which limits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to overcome this issue is to guide the detector towards *seeing what really matters*. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on identifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative architecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize a specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative architectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are unbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a novel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet decomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model to exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves the generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for complex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic generators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a single generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of other models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent results even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX.</description>

      <title>Med-GLIP: Advancing Medical Language-Image Pre-training with Large-scale Grounded Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation (MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage, coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data -- enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks, including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance gains. Our dataset will be released soon.</description>

      <title>MCTED: A Machine-Learning-Ready Dataset for Digital Elevation Model Generation From Mars Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model, DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in public repositories.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Referring Expression Comprehension via Vison-Language True/False Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG. Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.</description>

      <title>Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology (CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&amp;E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can support their effective development and deployment.</description>

      <title>Hemorica: A Comprehensive CT Scan Dataset for Automated Brain Hemorrhage Classification, Segmentation, and Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT) scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372 head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH), subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability. Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified, fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning, facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification systems.</description>

      <title>FlexAC: Towards Flexible Control of Associative Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.</description>

      <title>RealDPO: Real or Not Real, that is the Preference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Gestura: A LVLM-Powered System Bridging Motion and Semantics for Real-Time Free-Form Gesture Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.</description>

      <title>Caption-Driven Explainability: Probing CNNs for Bias via CLIP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

      <title>Residual Diffusion Bridge Model for Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

      <title>BasicAVSR: Arbitrary-Scale Video Super-Resolution via Image Priors and Enhanced Motion Compensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios.

      <title>OmniVLA: Physically-Grounded Multimodal VLA with Unified Multi-Sensor Perception for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization for robotic action prediction through large-scale vision-language pretraining. However, most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and, consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception guides the robotic manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning efficiency and stronger generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Source-Only Cross-Weather LiDAR via Geometry-Aware Point Drop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation degrades in adverse weather because refraction, scattering, and point dropouts corrupt geometry. Prior work in weather simulation, mixing-based augmentation, domain randomization, and uncertainty or boundary regularization improves robustness but still overlooks structural vulnerabilities near boundaries, corners, and sparse regions. We present a Light Geometry-aware adapter. The module aligns azimuth and applies horizontal circular padding to preserve neighbor continuity across the 0~360 degree wrap-around boundary. A local-window K-Nearest Neighbors gathers nearby points and computes simple local statistics, which are compressed into compact geometry-aware cues. During training, these cues drive region-aware regularization that stabilizes predictions in structurally fragile areas. The adapter is plug and play, complements augmentation, and can be enabled only during training with negligible inference cost. We adopt a source-only cross-weather setup where models train on SemanticKITTI and are evaluated on SemanticSTF without target labels or fine-tuning. The adapter improves mIoU by 7.9 percentage points over the data-centric augmentation baseline and by 0.6 points over the class-centric regularization baseline. These results indicate that geometry-driven regularization is a key direction for all-weather LiDAR segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3, which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic, and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks, each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally, we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07), 0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA (0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M). Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort compared to traditional U-Net.</description>

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations, ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness. Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models, particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively.

      <title>X-Diffusion: Generating Detailed 3D MRI Volumes From a Single Image Using Cross-Sectional Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial diagnostic tool, but high-resolution scans are often slow and expensive due to extensive data acquisition requirements. Traditional MRI reconstruction methods aim to expedite this process by filling in missing frequency components in the K-space, performing 3D-to-3D reconstructions that demand full 3D scans. In contrast, we introduce X-Diffusion, a novel cross-sectional diffusion model that reconstructs detailed 3D MRI volumes from extremely sparse spatial-domain inputs, achieving 2D-to-3D reconstruction from as little as a single 2D MRI slice or few slices. A key aspect of X-Diffusion is that it models MRI data as holistic 3D volumes during the cross-sectional training and inference, unlike previous learning approaches that treat MRI scans as collections of 2D slices in standard planes (coronal, axial, sagittal). We evaluated X-Diffusion on brain tumor MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Our results demonstrate that X-Diffusion not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative accuracy (PSNR) on unseen data but also preserves critical anatomical features such as tumor profiles, spine curvature, and brain volume. Remarkably, the model generalizes beyond the training domain, successfully reconstructing knee MRIs despite being trained exclusively on brain data. Medical expert evaluations further confirm the clinical relevance and fidelity of the generated images.To our knowledge, X-Diffusion is the first method capable of producing detailed 3D MRIs from highly limited 2D input data, potentially accelerating MRI acquisition and reducing associated costs.

      <title>Information-driven design of imaging systems</title>

Abstract: Imaging systems have traditionally been designed to mimic the human eye and produce visually interpretable measurements. Modern imaging systems, however, process raw measurements computationally before or instead of human viewing. As a result, the information content of raw measurements matters more than their visual interpretability. Despite the importance of measurement information content, current approaches for evaluating imaging system performance do not quantify it: they instead either use alternative metrics that assess specific aspects of measurement quality or assess measurements indirectly with performance on secondary tasks.
  We developed the theoretical foundations and a practical method to directly quantify mutual information between noisy measurements and unknown objects. By fitting probabilistic models to measurements and their noise characteristics, our method estimates information by upper bounding its true value. By applying gradient-based optimization to these estimates, we also developed a technique for designing imaging systems called Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL). Our information estimates accurately captured system performance differences across four imaging domains (color photography, radio astronomy, lensless imaging, and microscopy). Systems designed with IDEAL matched the performance of those designed with end-to-end optimization, the prevailing approach that jointly optimizes hardware and image processing algorithms. These results establish mutual information as a universal performance metric for imaging systems that enables both computationally efficient design optimization and evaluation in real-world conditions.

      <title>DAMRO: Dive into the Attention Mechanism of LVLM to Reduce Object Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they inevitably suffer from hallucination. As we know, both the visual encoder and the Large Language Model (LLM) decoder in LVLMs are Transformer-based, allowing the model to extract visual information and generate text outputs via attention mechanisms. We find that the attention distribution of LLM decoder on image tokens is highly consistent with the visual encoder and both distributions tend to focus on particular background tokens rather than the referred objects in the image. We attribute to the unexpected attention distribution to an inherent flaw in the visual encoder itself, which misguides LLMs to over emphasize the redundant information and generate object hallucination. To address the issue, we propose DAMRO, a novel training-free strategy that $D$ive into $A$ttention $M$echanism of LVLM to $R$educe $O$bject Hallucination. Specifically, our approach employs classification token (CLS) of ViT to filter out high-attention outlier tokens scattered in the background and then eliminate their influence during decoding stage. We evaluate our method on LVLMs including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and InstructBLIP, using various benchmarks such as POPE, CHAIR, MME and GPT-4V Aided Evaluation. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the impact of these outlier tokens, thus effectively alleviating the hallucination of LVLMs. The code is released at https://github.com/coder-gx/DAMRO.</description>

      <title>Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency. The codes are released at https://github.com/liwd190019/Shallow-Diffuse.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Task-Optimized Models of the Primate Visual Ventral Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate brain. While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling compute, model size, and dataset size improves task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate visual ventral stream by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and behavior. We find that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive biases and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Our results suggest that while scaling current architectures and datasets might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain models.</description>

      <title>GASP: Efficient Black-Box Generation of Adversarial Suffixes for Jailbreaking LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14133v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, yet remain vulnerable to input prompts, known as jailbreak attacks, carefully designed to bypass safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. Traditional methods rely on manual heuristics but suffer from limited generalizability. Despite being automatic, optimization-based attacks often produce unnatural prompts that can be easily detected by safety filters or require high computational costs due to discrete token optimization. In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Suffix Prompter (GASP), a novel automated framework that can efficiently generate human-readable jailbreak prompts in a fully black-box setting. In particular, GASP leverages latent Bayesian optimization to craft adversarial suffixes by efficiently exploring continuous latent embedding spaces, gradually optimizing the suffix prompter to improve attack efficacy while balancing prompt coherence via a targeted iterative refinement procedure. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that GASP can produce natural adversarial prompts, significantly improving jailbreak success over baselines, reducing training times, and accelerating inference speed, thus making it an efficient and scalable solution for red-teaming LLMs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Improving the Effectiveness of Synthetic Chest X-Rays for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To explore best-practice approaches for generating synthetic chest X-ray images and augmenting medical imaging datasets to optimize the performance of deep learning models in downstream tasks like classification and segmentation. Materials and Methods: We utilized a latent diffusion model to condition the generation of synthetic chest X-rays on text prompts and/or segmentation masks. We explored methods like using a proxy model and using radiologist feedback to improve the quality of synthetic data. These synthetic images were then generated from relevant disease information or geometrically transformed segmentation masks and added to ground truth training set images from the CheXpert, CANDID-PTX, SIIM, and RSNA Pneumonia datasets to measure improvements in classification and segmentation model performance on the test sets. F1 and Dice scores were used to evaluate classification and segmentation respectively. One-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction assessed the statistical significance of performance improvements with synthetic data. Results: Across all experiments, the synthetic data we generated resulted in a maximum mean classification F1 score improvement of 0.150453 (CI: 0.099108-0.201798; P=0.0031) compared to using only real data. For segmentation, the maximum Dice score improvement was 0.14575 (CI: 0.108267-0.183233; P=0.0064). Conclusion: Best practices for generating synthetic chest X-ray images for downstream tasks include conditioning on single-disease labels or geometrically transformed segmentation masks, as well as potentially using proxy modeling for fine-tuning such generations.</description>

      <title>SLAM&amp;Render: A Benchmark for the Intersection Between Neural Rendering, Gaussian Splatting and SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for Novel View Synthesis and Scene Rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific challenges of both fields, such as sequential operations and, in many settings, multi-modality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural rendering. Additionally, the data are often collected using sensors which are handheld or mounted on drones or mobile robots, which complicates the accurate reproduction of sensor motions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SLAM&amp;Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM, Novel View Rendering and Gaussian Splatting. Recorded with a robot manipulator, it uniquely includes 40 sequences with time-synchronized RGB-D images, IMU readings, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of recent integrations of SLAM paradigms within robotic applications. The dataset features five setups with consumer and industrial objects under four controlled lighting conditions, each with separate training and test trajectories. All sequences are static with different levels of object rearrangements and occlusions. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&amp;Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11234v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining good driving behavior in out-of-distribution scenarios remains a critical challenge in autonomous driving. A promising direction is to leverage the generalist knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large-language models by treating unusual driving scenarios as a logical reasoning task. In this work, we present Poutine, a method that uses an off-the-shelf 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) - without any additional components - to achieve robust end-to-end autonomous driving via a simple and scalable training recipe. To learn strong base driving capabilities, we first train Poutine-Base using self-supervised next-token prediction over vision, language, and trajectory (VLT) tokens, leveraging both nominal and long-tail driving data. In the second stage, we fine-tune Poutine-Base using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a small set of human preference-labeled examples. We evaluated our approach on the Waymo end-to-end driving benchmark curated for long-tail scenarios. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. Our results suggest that handcrafted tokenizers or custom architectural components added to base VLMs in prior work are not necessary to achieve strong driving performance. Instead, this work highlights the potential of scalable VLT pretraining combined with lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Particle-Grid Neural Dynamics for Learning Deformable Object Models from RGB-D Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multi-modal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causality-inspired framework named Cross-modal Causal Intervention with Mediator for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis (MediAD) for diagnostic assistance. Our MediAD employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, therefore enriching textual inputs. The MediAD model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), clinical data, and textual data enriched by LLMs to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as cerebral vascular lesions and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly mitigates the effect of both observable and unobservable confounders through a unified causal intervention method. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, outperforming other methods in most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

      <title>Learning to Navigate Socially Through Proactive Risk Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>Seg the HAB: Language-Guided Geospatial Algae Bloom Reasoning and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB), particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity. Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML) from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>TraceTrans: Translation and Spatial Tracing for Surgical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Toward Clinically Grounded Foundation Models in Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</description>
