      <title>A Universal Model for Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting human mobility is crucial for urban planning, traffic control, and emergency response. Mobility behaviors can be categorized into individual and collective, and these behaviors are recorded by diverse mobility data, such as individual trajectory and crowd flow. As different modalities of mobility data, individual trajectory and crowd flow have a close coupling relationship. Crowd flows originate from the bottom-up aggregation of individual trajectories, while the constraints imposed by crowd flows shape these individual trajectories. Existing mobility prediction methods are limited to single tasks due to modal gaps between individual trajectory and crowd flow. In this work, we aim to unify mobility prediction to break through the limitations of task-specific models. We propose a universal human mobility prediction model (named UniMob), which can be applied to both individual trajectory and crowd flow. UniMob leverages a multi-view mobility tokenizer that transforms both trajectory and flow data into spatiotemporal tokens, facilitating unified sequential modeling through a diffusion transformer architecture. To bridge the gap between the different characteristics of these two data modalities, we implement a novel bidirectional individual and collective alignment mechanism. This mechanism enables learning common spatiotemporal patterns from different mobility data, facilitating mutual enhancement of both trajectory and flow predictions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines in trajectory and flow prediction. Especially in noisy and scarce data scenarios, our model achieves the highest performance improvement of more than 14% and 25% in MAPE and Accuracy@5.</description>

      <title>Parametric $\rho$-Norm Scaling Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Output uncertainty indicates whether the probabilistic properties reflect objective characteristics of the model output. Unlike most loss functions and metrics in machine learning, uncertainty pertains to individual samples, but validating it on individual samples is unfeasible. When validated collectively, it cannot fully represent individual sample properties, posing a challenge in calibrating model confidence in a limited data set. Hence, it is crucial to consider confidence calibration characteristics. To counter the adverse effects of the gradual amplification of the classifier output amplitude in supervised learning, we introduce a post-processing parametric calibration method, $\rho$-Norm Scaling, which expands the calibrator expression and mitigates overconfidence due to excessive amplitude while preserving accuracy. Moreover, bin-level objective-based calibrator optimization often results in the loss of significant instance-level information. Therefore, we include probability distribution regularization, which incorporates specific priori information that the instance-level uncertainty distribution after calibration should resemble the distribution before calibration. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial enhancement in the post-processing calibrator for uncertainty calibration with our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Tokenphormer: Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in graph data mining tasks. Traditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize local and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and over-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph Transformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global receptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of structural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained token-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which generates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural information and explore global information at different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks consisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and contextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information coverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the Self-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the length and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these expressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node representations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the capability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>TinyLLM: A Framework for Training and Deploying Language Models at the Edge Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models have gained significant interest due to their general-purpose capabilities, which appear to emerge as models are scaled to increasingly larger parameter sizes. However, these large models impose stringent requirements on computing systems, necessitating significant memory and processing requirements for inference. This makes performing inference on mobile and edge devices challenging, often requiring invocating remotely-hosted models via network calls. Remote inference, in turn, introduces issues like latency, unreliable network connectivity, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we explored the possibility of deviating from the trend of increasing model size. Instead, we hypothesize that much smaller models (~30-120M parameters) can outperform their larger counterparts for specific tasks by carefully curating the data used for pre-training and fine-tuning. We investigate this within the context of deploying edge-device models to support sensing applications. We trained several foundational models through a systematic study and found that small models can run locally on edge devices, achieving high token rates and accuracy. Based on these findings, we developed a framework that allows users to train foundational models tailored to their specific applications and deploy them at the edge.</description>

      <title>Re-evaluating Group Robustness via Adaptive Class-Specific Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group distributionally robust optimization, which aims to improve robust accuracies -- worst-group and unbiased accuracies -- is a prominent algorithm used to mitigate spurious correlations and address dataset bias. Although existing approaches have reported improvements in robust accuracies, these gains often come at the cost of average accuracy due to inherent trade-offs. To control this trade-off flexibly and efficiently, we propose a simple class-specific scaling strategy, directly applicable to existing debiasing algorithms with no additional training. We further develop an instance-wise adaptive scaling technique to alleviate this trade-off, even leading to improvements in both robust and average accuracies. Our approach reveals that a na\"ive ERM baseline matches or even outperforms the recent debiasing methods by simply adopting the class-specific scaling technique. Additionally, we introduce a novel unified metric that quantifies the trade-off between the two accuracies as a scalar value, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of existing algorithms. By tackling the inherent trade-off and offering a performance landscape, our approach provides valuable insights into robust techniques beyond just robust accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments across datasets in computer vision and natural language processing domains.</description>

      <title>PCA-Featured Transformer for Jamming Detection in 5G UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming attacks pose a threat to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) wireless communication systems, potentially disrupting essential services and compromising network reliability. Current detection approaches struggle with sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) jamming techniques that adapt their patterns while existing machine learning solutions often require extensive feature engineering and fail to capture complex temporal dependencies in attack signatures. Furthermore, 5G networks using either Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) methods can face service degradation from intentional interference sources. To address these challenges, we present a novel transformer-based deep learning framework for jamming detection with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) added features. Our architecture leverages the transformer's self-attention mechanism to capture complex temporal dependencies and spatial correlations in wireless signal characteristics, enabling more robust jamming detection techniques. The U-shaped model incorporates a modified transformer encoder that processes signal features including received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) measurements, alongside a specialized positional encoding scheme that accounts for the periodic nature of wireless signals. In addition, we propose a batch size scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize training convergence for time series data. These advancements contribute to achieving up to a ten times improvement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder model introduced. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 90.33 \% in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 84.35 % in non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) and outperforms machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions such as the XGBoost (XGB) classifier in approximately 4%.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning and Concept Suppression for Pruned Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable progress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these models have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing computational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The combination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation quality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable behaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts, even when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion models that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a unified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of distillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer capabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content. This plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept unlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models in controlled environments.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models on Small Resource-Constrained Systems: Performance Characterization, Analysis and Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI like the Large Language Models (LLMs) has become more available for the general consumer in recent years. Publicly available services, e.g., ChatGPT, perform token generation on networked cloud server hardware, effectively removing the hardware entry cost for end users. However, the reliance on network access for these services, privacy and security risks involved, and sometimes the needs of the application make it necessary to run LLMs locally on edge devices. A significant amount of research has been done on optimization of LLMs and other transformer-based models on non-networked, resource-constrained devices, but they typically target older hardware. Our research intends to provide a 'baseline' characterization of more recent commercially available embedded hardware for LLMs, and to provide a simple utility to facilitate batch testing LLMs on recent Jetson hardware. We focus on the latest line of NVIDIA Jetson devices (Jetson Orin), and a set of publicly available LLMs (Pythia) ranging between 70 million and 1.4 billion parameters. Through detailed experimental evaluation with varying software and hardware parameters, we showcase trade-off spaces and optimization choices. Additionally, we design our testing structure to facilitate further research that involves performing batch LLM testing on Jetson hardware.</description>

      <title>GeoPro-Net: Learning Interpretable Spatiotemporal Prediction Models through Statistically-Guided Geo-Prototyping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of forecasting spatiotemporal events such as crimes and accidents is crucial to public safety and city management. Besides accuracy, interpretability is also a key requirement for spatiotemporal forecasting models to justify the decisions. Interpretation of the spatiotemporal forecasting mechanism is, however, challenging due to the complexity of multi-source spatiotemporal features, the non-intuitive nature of spatiotemporal patterns for non-expert users, and the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the data. Currently, no existing deep learning model intrinsically interprets the complex predictive process learned from multi-source spatiotemporal features. To bridge the gap, we propose GeoPro-Net, an intrinsically interpretable spatiotemporal model for spatiotemporal event forecasting problems. GeoPro-Net introduces a novel Geo-concept convolution operation, which employs statistical tests to extract predictive patterns in the input as Geo-concepts, and condenses the Geo-concept-encoded input through interpretable channel fusion and geographic-based pooling. In addition, GeoPro-Net learns different sets of prototypes of concepts inherently, and projects them to real-world cases for interpretation. Comprehensive experiments and case studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GeoPro-Net provides better interpretability while still achieving competitive prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Coherent Probabilistic Generation of Weather from Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative approach that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this inference task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>

      <title>LISA: Learning-Integrated Space Partitioning Framework for Traffic Accident Forecasting on Heterogeneous Spatiotemporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic accident forecasting is an important task for intelligent transportation management and emergency response systems. However, this problem is challenging due to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. Existing data-driven methods mostly focus on studying homogeneous areas with limited size (e.g. a single urban area such as New York City) and fail to handle the heterogeneous accident patterns over space at different scales. Recent advances (e.g. spatial ensemble) utilize pre-defined space partitions and learn multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. However, external knowledge is required to define proper space partitions before training models and pre-defined partitions may not necessarily reduce the heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose a novel Learning-Integrated Space Partition Framework (LISA) to simultaneously learn partitions while training models, where the partitioning process and learning process are integrated in a way that partitioning is guided explicitly by prediction accuracy rather than other factors. Experiments using real-world datasets, demonstrate that our work can capture underlying heterogeneous patterns in a self-guided way and substantially improve baseline networks by an average of 13.0%.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Fidelity Graph U-Net Model for Accelerated Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based deep learning frameworks have shown to be effective in accurately modeling the dynamics of complex physical systems with generalization capability across problem inputs. Data-driven networks like GNN, Neural Operators have proved to be very effective in generalizing the model across unseen domain and resolutions. But one of the most critical issues in these data-based models is the computational cost of generating training datasets. Complex phenomena can only be captured accurately using deep networks with large training datasets. Furthermore, numerical error of training samples is propagated in the model errors, thus requiring the need for accurate data, i.e. FEM solutions on high-resolution meshes. Multi-fidelity methods offer a potential solution to reduce the training data requirements. To this end, we propose a novel GNN architecture, Multi-Fidelity U-Net, that utilizes the advantages of the multi-fidelity methods for enhancing the performance of the GNN model. The proposed architecture utilizes the capability of GNNs to manage complex geometries across different fidelity levels, while enabling flow of information between these levels for improved prediction accuracy for high-fidelity graphs. We show that the proposed approach performs significantly better in accuracy and data requirement and only requires training of a single network compared to other benchmark multi-fidelity approaches like transfer learning. We also present Multi-Fidelity U-Net Lite, a faster version of the proposed architecture, with 35% faster training, with 2 to 5% reduction in accuracy. We carry out extensive validation to show that the proposed models surpass traditional single-fidelity GNN models in their performance, thus providing feasible alternative for addressing computational and accuracy requirements where traditional high-fidelity simulations can be time-consuming.</description>

      <title>Granger Causality Detection with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in time series data is central in many scientific areas, ranging from economics to climate science. Granger causality is a powerful tool for causality detection. However, its original formulation is limited by its linear form and only recently nonlinear machine-learning generalizations have been introduced. This study contributes to the definition of neural Granger causality models by investigating the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in Granger causality detection and comparing their capabilities against multilayer perceptrons (MLP). In this work, we develop a framework called Granger Causality KAN (GC-KAN) along with a tailored training approach designed specifically for Granger causality detection. We test this framework on both Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models and chaotic Lorenz-96 systems, analysing the ability of KANs to sparsify input features by identifying Granger causal relationships, providing a concise yet accurate model for Granger causality detection. Our findings show the potential of KANs to outperform MLPs in discerning interpretable Granger causal relationships, particularly for the ability of identifying sparse Granger causality patterns in high-dimensional settings, and more generally, the potential of AI in causality discovery for the dynamical laws in physical systems.</description>

      <title>LG-Sleep: Local and Global Temporal Dependencies for Mice Sleep Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently identifying sleep stages is crucial for unraveling the intricacies of sleep in both preclinical and clinical research. The labor-intensive nature of manual sleep scoring, demanding substantial expertise, has prompted a surge of interest in automated alternatives. Sleep studies in mice play a significant role in understanding sleep patterns and disorders and underscore the need for robust scoring methodologies. In response, this study introduces LG-Sleep, a novel subject-independent deep neural network architecture designed for mice sleep scoring through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. LG-Sleep extracts local and global temporal transitions within EEG signals to categorize sleep data into three stages: wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The model leverages local and global temporal information by employing time-distributed convolutional neural networks to discern local temporal transitions in EEG data. Subsequently, features derived from the convolutional filters traverse long short-term memory blocks, capturing global transitions over extended periods. Crucially, the model is optimized in an autoencoder-decoder fashion, facilitating generalization across distinct subjects and adapting to limited training samples. Experimental findings demonstrate superior performance of LG-Sleep compared to conventional deep neural networks. Moreover, the model exhibits good performance across different sleep stages even when tasked with scoring based on limited training samples.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction with Locally Adjusted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension reduction (DR) algorithms have proven to be extremely useful for gaining insight into large-scale high-dimensional datasets, particularly finding clusters in transcriptomic data. The initial phase of these DR methods often involves converting the original high-dimensional data into a graph. In this graph, each edge represents the similarity or dissimilarity between pairs of data points. However, this graph is frequently suboptimal due to unreliable high-dimensional distances and the limited information extracted from the high-dimensional data. This problem is exacerbated as the dataset size increases. If we reduce the size of the dataset by selecting points for a specific sections of the embeddings, the clusters observed through DR are more separable since the extracted subgraphs are more reliable. In this paper, we introduce LocalMAP, a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that dynamically and locally adjusts the graph to address this challenge. By dynamically extracting subgraphs and updating the graph on-the-fly, LocalMAP is capable of identifying and separating real clusters within the data that other DR methods may overlook or combine. We demonstrate the benefits of LocalMAP through a case study on biological datasets, highlighting its utility in helping users more accurately identify clusters for real-world problems.</description>

      <title>AdaCred: Adaptive Causal Decision Transformers with Feature Crediting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can be formulated as a sequence modeling problem, where models predict future actions based on historical state-action-reward sequences. Current approaches typically require long trajectory sequences to model the environment in offline RL settings. However, these models tend to over-rely on memorizing long-term representations, which impairs their ability to effectively attribute importance to trajectories and learned representations based on task-specific relevance. In this work, we introduce AdaCred, a novel approach that represents trajectories as causal graphs built from short-term action-reward-state sequences. Our model adaptively learns control policy by crediting and pruning low-importance representations, retaining only those most relevant for the downstream task. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaCred-based policies require shorter trajectory sequences and consistently outperform conventional methods in both offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning environments.</description>

      <title>Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Time Will Tell: Timing Side Channels via Output Token Count in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a new side-channel that enables an adversary to extract sensitive information about inference inputs in large language models (LLMs) based on the number of output tokens in the LLM response. We construct attacks using this side-channel in two common LLM tasks: recovering the target language in machine translation tasks and recovering the output class in classification tasks. In addition, due to the auto-regressive generation mechanism in LLMs, an adversary can recover the output token count reliably using a timing channel, even over the network against a popular closed-source commercial LLM. Our experiments show that an adversary can learn the output language in translation tasks with more than 75% precision across three different models (Tower, M2M100, MBart50). Using this side-channel, we also show the input class in text classification tasks can be leaked out with more than 70% precision from open-source LLMs like Llama-3.1, Llama-3.2, Gemma2, and production models like GPT-4o. Finally, we propose tokenizer-, system-, and prompt-based mitigations against the output token count side-channel.</description>

      <title>Non-Uniform Parameter-Wise Model Merging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining multiple machine learning models has long been a technique for enhancing performance, particularly in distributed settings. Traditional approaches, such as model ensembles, work well, but are expensive in terms of memory and compute. Recently, methods based on averaging model parameters have achieved good results in some settings and have gained popularity. However, merging models initialized differently that do not share a part of their training trajectories can yield worse results than simply using the base models, even after aligning their neurons. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Non-uniform Parameter-wise Model Merging, or NP Merge, which merges models by learning the contribution of each parameter to the final model using gradient-based optimization. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for merging models of various architectures in multiple settings, outperforming past methods. We also extend NP Merge to handle the merging of multiple models, showcasing its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Task-Specific Preconditioner for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning~(CDFSL) methods typically parameterize models with task-agnostic and task-specific parameters. To adapt task-specific parameters, recent approaches have utilized fixed optimization strategies, despite their potential sub-optimality across varying domains or target tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptation mechanism called Task-Specific Preconditioned gradient descent~(TSP). Our method first meta-learns Domain-Specific Preconditioners~(DSPs) that capture the characteristics of each meta-training domain, which are then linearly combined using task-coefficients to form the Task-Specific Preconditioner. The preconditioner is applied to gradient descent, making the optimization adaptive to the target task. We constrain our preconditioners to be positive definite, guiding the preconditioned gradient toward the direction of steepest descent. Empirical evaluations on the Meta-Dataset show that TSP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Understanding When and Why Graph Attention Mechanisms Work via Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing popularity of graph attention mechanisms, their theoretical understanding remains limited. This paper aims to explore the conditions under which these mechanisms are effective in node classification tasks through the lens of Contextual Stochastic Block Models (CSBMs). Our theoretical analysis reveals that incorporating graph attention mechanisms is \emph{not universally beneficial}. Specifically, by appropriately defining \emph{structure noise} and \emph{feature noise} in graphs, we show that graph attention mechanisms can enhance classification performance when structure noise exceeds feature noise. Conversely, when feature noise predominates, simpler graph convolution operations are more effective. Furthermore, we examine the over-smoothing phenomenon and show that, in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, graph convolutional networks suffer from over-smoothing, whereas graph attention mechanisms can effectively resolve this issue. Building on these insights, we propose a novel multi-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture that significantly outperforms single-layer GATs in achieving \emph{perfect node classification} in CSBMs, relaxing the SNR requirement from $ \omega(\sqrt{\log n}) $ to $ \omega(\sqrt{\log n} / \sqrt[3]{n}) $. To our knowledge, this is the first study to delineate the conditions for perfect node classification using multi-layer GATs. Our theoretical contributions are corroborated by extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting the practical implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>A Robust Prototype-Based Network with Interpretable RBF Classifier Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prototype-based classification learning methods are known to be inherently interpretable. However, this paradigm suffers from major limitations compared to deep models, such as lower performance. This led to the development of the so-called deep Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs), also known as prototypical parts models. In this work, we analyze these models with respect to different properties, including interpretability. In particular, we focus on the Classification-by-Components (CBC) approach, which uses a probabilistic model to ensure interpretability and can be used as a shallow or deep architecture. We show that this model has several shortcomings, like creating contradicting explanations. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of CBC that solves these issues. Moreover, we prove that this extension has robustness guarantees and derive a loss that optimizes robustness. Additionally, our analysis shows that most (deep) PBNs are related to (deep) RBF classifiers, which implies that our robustness guarantees generalize to shallow RBF classifiers. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our deep PBN yields state-of-the-art classification accuracy on different benchmarks while resolving the interpretability shortcomings of other approaches. Further, our shallow PBN variant outperforms other shallow PBNs while being inherently interpretable and exhibiting provable robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>Stylish and Functional: Guided Interpolation Subject to Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is revolutionizing engineering design practices by enabling rapid prototyping and manipulation of designs. One example of design manipulation involves taking two reference design images and using them as prompts to generate a design image that combines aspects of both. Real engineering designs have physical constraints and functional requirements in addition to aesthetic design considerations. Internet-scale foundation models commonly used for image generation, however, are unable to take these physical constraints and functional requirements into consideration as part of the generation process. We consider the problem of generating a design inspired by two input designs, and propose a zero-shot framework toward enforcing physical, functional requirements over the generation process by leveraging a pretrained diffusion model as the backbone. As a case study, we consider the example of rotational symmetry in generation of wheel designs. Automotive wheels are required to be rotationally symmetric for physical stability. We formulate the requirement of rotational symmetry by the use of a symmetrizer, and we use this symmetrizer to guide the diffusion process towards symmetric wheel generations. Our experimental results find that the proposed approach makes generated interpolations with higher realism than methods in related work, as evaluated by Fr\'echet inception distance (FID). We also find that our approach generates designs that more closely satisfy physical and functional requirements than generating without the symmetry guidance.</description>

      <title>RESQUE: Quantifying Estimator to Task and Distribution Shift for Sustainable Model Reusability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a strategy for sustainability of deep learning, reusing an existing model by retraining it rather than training a new model from scratch is critical. In this paper, we propose REpresentation Shift QUantifying Estimator (RESQUE), a predictive quantifier to estimate the retraining cost of a model to distributional shifts or change of tasks. It provides a single concise index for an estimate of resources required for retraining the model. Through extensive experiments, we show that RESQUE has a strong correlation with various retraining measures. Our results validate that RESQUE is an effective indicator in terms of epochs, gradient norms, changes of parameter magnitude, energy, and carbon emissions. These measures align well with RESQUE for new tasks, multiple noise types, and varying noise intensities. As a result, RESQUE enables users to make informed decisions for retraining to different tasks/distribution shifts and determine the most cost-effective and sustainable option, allowing for the reuse of a model with a much smaller footprint in the environment.

      <title>Novelty-Guided Data Reuse for Efficient and Diversified Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has demonstrated its potential to tackle complex cooperative tasks, pushing the boundaries of AI in collaborative environments. However, the efficiency of these systems is often compromised by inadequate sample utilization and a lack of diversity in learning strategies. To enhance MARL performance, we introduce a novel sample reuse approach that dynamically adjusts policy updates based on observation novelty. Specifically, we employ a Random Network Distillation (RND) network to gauge the novelty of each agent's current state, assigning additional sample update opportunities based on the uniqueness of the data. We name our method Multi-Agent Novelty-GuidEd sample Reuse (MANGER). This method increases sample efficiency and promotes exploration and diverse agent behaviors. Our evaluations confirm substantial improvements in MARL effectiveness in complex cooperative scenarios such as Google Research Football and super-hard StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.</description>

      <title>PreNeT: Leveraging Computational Features to Predict Deep Neural Network Training Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training deep learning models, particularly Transformer-based architectures such as Large Language Models (LLMs), demands substantial computational resources and extended training periods. While optimal configuration and infrastructure selection can significantly reduce associated costs, this optimization requires preliminary analysis tools. This paper introduces PreNeT, a novel predictive framework designed to address this optimization challenge. PreNeT facilitates training optimization by integrating comprehensive computational metrics, including layer-specific parameters, arithmetic operations and memory utilization. A key feature of PreNeT is its capacity to accurately predict training duration on previously unexamined hardware infrastructures, including novel accelerator architectures. This framework employs a sophisticated approach to capture and analyze the distinct characteristics of various neural network layers, thereby enhancing existing prediction methodologies. Through proactive implementation of PreNeT, researchers and practitioners can determine optimal configurations, parameter settings, and hardware specifications to maximize cost-efficiency and minimize training duration. Experimental results demonstrate that PreNeT achieves up to 72% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Back-Stepping Experience Replay in Sparse-Reward Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Back-stepping experience replay (BER) is a reinforcement learning technique that can accelerate learning efficiency in reversible environments. BER trains an agent with generated back-stepping transitions of collected experiences and normal forward transitions. However, the original algorithm is designed for a dense-reward environment that does not require complex exploration, limiting the BER technique to demonstrate its full potential. Herein, we propose an enhanced version of BER called Generalized BER (GBER), which extends the original algorithm to sparse-reward environments, particularly those with complex structures that require the agent to explore. GBER improves the performance of BER by introducing relabeling mechanism and applying diverse sampling strategies. We evaluate our modified version, which is based on a goal-conditioned deep deterministic policy gradient offline learning algorithm, across various maze navigation environments. The experimental results indicate that the GBER algorithm can significantly boost the performance and stability of the baseline algorithm in various sparse-reward environments, especially those with highly structural symmetricity.</description>

      <title>SORREL: Suboptimal-Demonstration-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Learning to Branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) solvers are mostly built upon a Branch-and-Bound (B\&amp;B) algorithm, where the efficiency of traditional solvers heavily depends on hand-crafted heuristics for branching. The past few years have witnessed the increasing popularity of data-driven approaches to automatically learn these heuristics. However, the success of these methods is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality demonstrations, which requires either the development of near-optimal heuristics or a time-consuming sampling process. This paper averts this challenge by proposing Suboptimal-Demonstration-Guided Reinforcement Learning (SORREL) for learning to branch. SORREL selectively learns from suboptimal demonstrations based on value estimation. It utilizes suboptimal demonstrations through both offline reinforcement learning on the demonstrations generated by suboptimal heuristics and self-imitation learning on past good experiences sampled by itself. Our experiments demonstrate its advanced performance in both branching quality and training efficiency over previous methods for various MILPs.</description>

      <title>FedRLHF: A Convergence-Guaranteed Federated Framework for Privacy-Preserving and Personalized RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of increasing privacy concerns and demand for personalized experiences, traditional Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) frameworks face significant challenges due to their reliance on centralized data. We introduce Federated Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (FedRLHF), a novel framework that decentralizes the RLHF process. FedRLHF enables collaborative policy learning across multiple clients without necessitating the sharing of raw data or human feedback, thereby ensuring robust privacy preservation. Leveraging federated reinforcement learning, each client integrates human feedback locally into their reward functions and updates their policies through personalized RLHF processes. We establish rigorous theoretical foundations for FedRLHF, providing convergence guarantees, and deriving sample complexity bounds that scale efficiently with the number of clients. Empirical evaluations on the MovieLens and IMDb datasets demonstrate that FedRLHF not only preserves user privacy but also achieves performance on par with centralized RLHF, while enhancing personalization across diverse client environments.</description>

      <title>AutoRank: MCDA Based Rank Personalization for LoRA-Enabled Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data volumes expand rapidly, distributed machine learning has become essential for addressing the growing computational demands of modern AI systems. However, training models in distributed environments is challenging with participants hold skew, Non-Independent-Identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a promising solution to this problem by personalizing low-rank updates rather than optimizing the entire model, LoRA-enabled distributed learning minimizes computational and maximize personalization for each participant. Enabling more robust and efficient training in distributed learning settings, especially in large-scale, heterogeneous systems. Despite the strengths of current state-of-the-art methods, they often require manual configuration of the initial rank, which is increasingly impractical as the number of participants grows. This manual tuning is not only time-consuming but also prone to suboptimal configurations. To address this limitation, we propose AutoRank, an adaptive rank-setting algorithm inspired by the bias-variance trade-off. AutoRank leverages the MCDA method TOPSIS to dynamically assign local ranks based on the complexity of each participant's data. By evaluating data distribution and complexity through our proposed data complexity metrics, AutoRank provides fine-grained adjustments to the rank of each participant's local LoRA model. This adaptive approach effectively mitigates the challenges of double-imbalanced, non-IID data. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRank significantly reduces computational overhead, enhances model performance, and accelerates convergence in highly heterogeneous federated learning environments. Through its strong adaptability, AutoRank offers a scalable and flexible solution for distributed machine learning.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Aware Learning Curve Extrapolation via Graph Ordinary Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning curve extrapolation predicts neural network performance from early training epochs and has been applied to accelerate AutoML, facilitating hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search. However, existing methods typically model the evolution of learning curves in isolation, neglecting the impact of neural network (NN) architectures, which influence the loss landscape and learning trajectories. In this work, we explore whether incorporating neural network architecture improves learning curve modeling and how to effectively integrate this architectural information. Motivated by the dynamical system view of optimization, we propose a novel architecture-aware neural differential equation model to forecast learning curves continuously. We empirically demonstrate its ability to capture the general trend of fluctuating learning curves while quantifying uncertainty through variational parameters. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art learning curve extrapolation methods and pure time-series modeling approaches for both MLP and CNN-based learning curves. Additionally, we explore the applicability of our method in Neural Architecture Search scenarios, such as training configuration ranking.</description>

      <title>Spatial Clustering of Citizen Science Data Improves Downstream Species Distribution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citizen science biodiversity data present great opportunities for ecology and conservation across vast spatial and temporal scales. However, the opportunistic nature of these data lacks the sampling structure required by modeling methodologies that address a pervasive challenge in ecological data collection: imperfect detection, i.e., the likelihood of under-observing species on field surveys. Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that accounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process separately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces species distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a landscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the pattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit, occupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's status (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant. Since citizen science data are not collected under the required repeated-visit protocol, observations may be grouped into sites post hoc. Existing approaches for constructing sites discard some observations and/or consider only geographic distance and not environmental similarity. In this study, we compare ten approaches for site construction in terms of their impact on downstream species distribution models for 31 bird species in Oregon, using observations recorded in the eBird database. We find that occupancy models built on sites constructed by spatial clustering algorithms perform better than existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning Using a Kernel-Based Method Over Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) learns a sequence of tasks incrementally. This paper studies the challenging CL setting of class-incremental learning (CIL). CIL has two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting (CF) and inter-task class separation (ICS). Despite numerous proposed methods, these issues remain persistent obstacles. This paper proposes a novel CIL method, called Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA), that can effectively avoid CF and ICS problems. It leverages only the powerful features learned in a foundation model (FM). However, directly using these features proves suboptimal. To address this, KLDA incorporates the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and its Random Fourier Features (RFF) to enhance the feature representations from the FM, leading to improved performance. When a new task arrives, KLDA computes only the mean for each class in the task and updates a shared covariance matrix for all learned classes based on the kernelized features. Classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our empirical evaluation using text and image classification datasets demonstrates that KLDA significantly outperforms baselines. Remarkably, without relying on replay data, KLDA achieves accuracy comparable to joint training of all classes, which is considered the upper bound for CIL performance. The KLDA code is available at https://github.com/salehmomeni/klda.</description>

      <title>A Deep Probabilistic Framework for Continuous Time Dynamic Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph representation learning have shifted attention towards dynamic graphs, which exhibit evolving topologies and features over time. The increased use of such graphs creates a paramount need for generative models suitable for applications such as data augmentation, obfuscation, and anomaly detection. However, there are few generative techniques that handle continuously changing temporal graph data; existing work largely relies on augmenting static graphs with additional temporal information to model dynamic interactions between nodes. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different approach: We instead directly model interactions as a joint probability of an edge forming between two nodes at a given time. This allows us to autoregressively generate new synthetic dynamic graphs in a largely assumption free, scalable, and inductive manner. We formalize this approach as DG-Gen, a generative framework for continuous time dynamic graphs, and demonstrate its effectiveness over five datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that DG-Gen not only generates higher fidelity graphs compared to traditional methods but also significantly advances link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Graph Neural Networks on Molecules by Using Subgraph-Conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to build a pre-trained Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on molecules without human annotations or prior knowledge. Although various attempts have been proposed to overcome limitations in acquiring labeled molecules, the previous pre-training methods still rely on semantic subgraphs, i.e., functional groups. Only focusing on the functional groups could overlook the graph-level distinctions. The key challenge to build a pre-trained GNN on molecules is how to (1) generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and (2) automatically discover the functional groups without prior knowledge. To solve it, we propose a novel Subgraph-conditioned Graph Information Bottleneck, named S-CGIB, for pre-training GNNs to recognize core subgraphs (graph cores) and significant subgraphs. The main idea is that the graph cores contain compressed and sufficient information that could generate well-distinguished graph-level representations and reconstruct the input graph conditioned on significant subgraphs across molecules under the S-CGIB principle. To discover significant subgraphs without prior knowledge about functional groups, we propose generating a set of functional group candidates, i.e., ego networks, and using an attention-based interaction between the graph core and the candidates. Despite being identified from self-supervised learning, our learned subgraphs match the real-world functional groups. Extensive experiments on molecule datasets across various domains demonstrate the superiority of S-CGIB.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Techniques for Pattern Recognition in High-Dimensional Data Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequent pattern data mining algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM), aiming to solve the performance bottleneck of traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms in high-dimensional and sparse data environments. By converting the frequent pattern mining task into a classification problem, the SVM model is introduced to improve the accuracy and robustness of pattern extraction. In terms of method design, the kernel function is used to map the data to a high-dimensional feature space, so as to construct the optimal classification hyperplane, realize the nonlinear separation of patterns and the accurate mining of frequent items. In the experiment, two public datasets, Retail and Mushroom, were selected to compare and analyze the proposed algorithm with traditional FP-Growth, FP-Tree, decision tree and random forest models. The experimental results show that the algorithm in this paper is significantly better than the traditional model in terms of three key indicators: support, confidence and lift, showing strong pattern recognition ability and rule extraction effect. The study shows that the SVM model has excellent performance advantages in an environment with high data sparsity and a large number of transactions, and can effectively cope with complex pattern mining tasks. At the same time, this paper also points out the potential direction of future research, including the introduction of deep learning and ensemble learning frameworks to further improve the scalability and adaptability of the algorithm. This research not only provides a new idea for frequent pattern mining, but also provides important technical support for solving pattern discovery and association rule mining problems in practical applications.</description>

      <title>SODor: Long-Term EEG Partitioning for Seizure Onset Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have recently shown great success in classifying epileptic patients using EEG recordings. Unfortunately, classification-based methods lack a sound mechanism to detect the onset of seizure events. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework, \method, that explicitly models seizure onset through a novel task formulation of subsequence clustering. Given an EEG sequence, the framework first learns a set of second-level embeddings with label supervision. It then employs model-based clustering to explicitly capture long-term temporal dependencies in EEG sequences and identify meaningful subsequences. Epochs within a subsequence share a common cluster assignment (normal or seizure), with cluster or state transitions representing successful onset detections. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method can correct misclassifications, achieving 5%-11% classification improvements over other baselines and accurately detecting seizure onsets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Human Data: Aligning Multimodal Large Language Models by Iterative Self-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human preference alignment can greatly enhance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but collecting high-quality preference data is costly. A promising solution is the self-evolution strategy, where models are iteratively trained on data they generate. However, current techniques still rely on human- or GPT-annotated data and sometimes require additional models or ground truth answers. To address these issues, we propose a novel multimodal self-evolution framework that enables the model to autonomously generate high-quality questions and answers using only unannotated images.
  First, we implement an image-driven self-questioning mechanism, allowing the model to create and evaluate questions based on image content, regenerating them if they are irrelevant or unanswerable. This sets a strong foundation for answer generation. Second, we introduce an answer self-enhancement technique, starting with image captioning to improve answer quality. We also use corrupted images to generate rejected answers, forming distinct preference pairs for optimization. Finally, we incorporate an image content alignment loss function alongside Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss to reduce hallucinations, ensuring the model focuses on image content.
  Experiments show that our framework performs competitively with methods using external information, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Tabular Data Generation for Imbalanced Classification: The Surprising Effectiveness of an Overlap Class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling imbalance in class distribution when building a classifier over tabular data has been a problem of long-standing interest. One popular approach is augmenting the training dataset with synthetically generated data. While classical augmentation techniques were limited to linear interpolation of existing minority class examples, recently higher capacity deep generative models are providing greater promise.
  However, handling of imbalance in class distribution when building a deep generative model is also a challenging problem, that has not been studied as extensively as imbalanced classifier model training. We show that state-of-the-art deep generative models yield significantly lower-quality minority examples than majority examples. %In this paper, we start with the observation that imbalanced data training of generative models trained imbalanced dataset which under-represent the minority class. We propose a novel technique of converting the binary class labels to ternary class labels by introducing a class for the region where minority and majority distributions overlap. We show that just this pre-processing of the training set, significantly improves the quality of data generated spanning several state-of-the-art diffusion and GAN-based models. While training the classifier using synthetic data, we remove the overlap class from the training data and justify the reasons behind the enhanced accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on four real-life datasets, five different classifiers, and five generative models demonstrating that our method enhances not only the synthesizer performance of state-of-the-art models but also the classifier performance.</description>

      <title>Theory of Mixture-of-Experts for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile edge computing (MEC) networks, mobile users generate diverse machine learning tasks dynamically over time. These tasks are typically offloaded to the nearest available edge server, by considering communication and computational efficiency. However, its operation does not ensure that each server specializes in a specific type of tasks and leads to severe overfitting or catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks. To improve the continual learning (CL) performance of online tasks, we are the first to introduce mixture-of-experts (MoE) theory in MEC networks and save MEC operation from the increasing generalization error over time. Our MoE theory treats each MEC server as an expert and dynamically adapts to changes in server availability by considering data transfer and computation time. Unlike existing MoE models designed for offline tasks, ours is tailored for handling continuous streams of tasks in the MEC environment. We introduce an adaptive gating network in MEC to adaptively identify and route newly arrived tasks of unknown data distributions to available experts, enabling each expert to specialize in a specific type of tasks upon convergence. We derived the minimum number of experts required to match each task with a specialized, available expert. Our MoE approach consistently reduces the overall generalization error over time, unlike the traditional MEC approach. Interestingly, when the number of experts is sufficient to ensure convergence, adding more experts delays the convergence time and worsens the generalization error. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on real datasets in deep neural networks (DNNs) to verify our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for extending Ricci flow to hypergraphs by defining probability measures on the edges and transporting them on the line expansion. This approach yields a new weighting on the edges, which proves particularly effective for community detection. We extensively compare this method with a similar notion of Ricci flow defined on the clique expansion, demonstrating its enhanced sensitivity to the hypergraph structure, especially in the presence of large hyperedges. The two methods are complementary and together form a powerful and highly interpretable framework for community detection in hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are trained with relatively simple objectives, such as next token prediction. However, on deployment, they appear to capture a more fundamental representation of their input data. It is of interest to understand the nature of these representations to help interpret the model's outputs and to identify ways to improve the salience of these representations. Concept vectors are constructions aimed at attributing concepts in the input data to directions, represented by vectors, in the model's latent space. In this work, we introduce concept boundary vectors as a concept vector construction derived from the boundary between the latent representations of concepts. Empirically we demonstrate that concept boundary vectors capture a concept's semantic meaning, and we compare their effectiveness against concept activation vectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception in 2016, Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining tremendous popularity in the machine learning community. Several frameworks have been proposed to facilitate the development of FL algorithms, but researchers often resort to implementing their algorithms from scratch, including all baselines and experiments. This is because existing frameworks are not flexible enough to support their needs or the learning curve to extend them is too steep. In this paper, we present \fluke, a Python package designed to simplify the development of new FL algorithms. fluke is specifically designed for prototyping purposes and is meant for researchers or practitioners focusing on the learning components of a federated system. fluke is open-source, and it can be either used out of the box or extended with new algorithms with minimal overhead.</description>

      <title>Prompt-based Unifying Inference Attack on Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide important prospective insights in applications such as social behavior analysis and financial risk analysis based on their powerful learning capabilities on graph data. Nevertheless, GNNs' predictive performance relies on the quality of task-specific node labels, so it is common practice to improve the model's generalization ability in the downstream execution of decision-making tasks through pre-training. Graph prompting is a prudent choice but risky without taking measures to prevent data leakage. In other words, in high-risk decision scenarios, prompt learning can infer private information by accessing model parameters trained on private data (publishing model parameters in pre-training, i.e., without directly leaking the raw data, is a tacitly accepted trend). However, myriad graph inference attacks necessitate tailored module design and processing to enhance inference capabilities due to variations in supervision signals. In this paper, we propose a novel Prompt-based unifying Inference Attack framework on GNNs, named ProIA. Specifically, ProIA retains the crucial topological information of the graph during pre-training, enhancing the background knowledge of the inference attack model. It then utilizes a unified prompt and introduces additional disentanglement factors in downstream attacks to adapt to task-relevant knowledge. Finally, extensive experiments show that ProIA enhances attack capabilities and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to various inference attacks.</description>

      <title>Extracting Interpretable Task-Specific Circuits from Large Language Models for Faster Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. However, the size of LLMs is steadily increasing, hindering their application on computationally constrained environments. On the other hand, despite their general capabilities, there are many situations where only one specific task is performed, rendering all other capabilities unnecessary and wasteful. This leads us to the following question: Is it possible to extract the minimal subset from an LLM that is able to perform a specific task in a faster, standalone manner? Recent works on Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) have shown that specific tasks are performed by a localized subset of components, or circuit. However, current techniques used to identify the circuit cannot be used to extract it for its standalone usage. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically extract the subset of the LLM that properly performs a targeted task requiring no additional training and a small amount of data samples. We evaluate our approach on different tasks and show that the resulting models are (i) considerably smaller, reducing the number of parameters up to 82.77% and (ii) more interpretable, as they focus on the circuit that is used to carry out the specific task, and can therefore be understood using MI techniques.</description>

      <title>Function Space Diversity for Uncertainty Prediction via Repulsive Last-Layer Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference in function space has gained attention due to its robustness against overparameterization in neural networks. However, approximating the infinite-dimensional function space introduces several challenges. In this work, we discuss function space inference via particle optimization and present practical modifications that improve uncertainty estimation and, most importantly, make it applicable for large and pretrained networks. First, we demonstrate that the input samples, where particle predictions are enforced to be diverse, are detrimental to the model performance. While diversity on training data itself can lead to underfitting, the use of label-destroying data augmentation, or unlabeled out-of-distribution data can improve prediction diversity and uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we take advantage of the function space formulation, which imposes no restrictions on network parameterization other than sufficient flexibility. Instead of using full deep ensembles to represent particles, we propose a single multi-headed network that introduces a minimal increase in parameters and computation. This allows seamless integration to pretrained networks, where this repulsive last-layer ensemble can be used for uncertainty aware fine-tuning at minimal additional cost. We achieve competitive results in disentangling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty for active learning, detecting out-of-domain data, and providing calibrated uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts with minimal compute and memory.</description>

      <title>WebLLM: A High-Performance In-Browser LLM Inference Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked remarkable capabilities. While deploying these models typically requires server-grade GPUs and cloud-based inference, the recent emergence of smaller open-source models and increasingly powerful consumer devices have made on-device deployment practical. The web browser as a platform for on-device deployment is universally accessible, provides a natural agentic environment, and conveniently abstracts out the different backends from diverse device vendors. To address this opportunity, we introduce WebLLM, an open-source JavaScript framework that enables high-performance LLM inference entirely within web browsers. WebLLM provides an OpenAI-style API for seamless integration into web applications, and leverages WebGPU for efficient local GPU acceleration and WebAssembly for performant CPU computation. With machine learning compilers MLC-LLM and Apache TVM, WebLLM leverages optimized WebGPU kernels, overcoming the absence of performant WebGPU kernel libraries. Evaluations show that WebLLM can retain up to 80% native performance on the same device, with room to further close the gap. WebLLM paves the way for universally accessible, privacy-preserving, personalized, and locally powered LLM applications in web browsers. The code is available at: https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm.</description>

      <title>S$^2$DN: Learning to Denoise Unconvincing Knowledge for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to infer missing facts between newly emerged entities within knowledge graphs (KGs), posing a significant challenge. While recent studies have shown promising results in inferring such entities through knowledge subgraph reasoning, they suffer from (i) the semantic inconsistencies of similar relations, and (ii) noisy interactions inherent in KGs due to the presence of unconvincing knowledge for emerging entities. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic Structure-aware Denoising Network (S$^2$DN) for inductive KGC. Our goal is to learn adaptable general semantics and reliable structures to distill consistent semantic knowledge while preserving reliable interactions within KGs. Specifically, we introduce a semantic smoothing module over the enclosing subgraphs to retain the universal semantic knowledge of relations. We incorporate a structure refining module to filter out unreliable interactions and offer additional knowledge, retaining robust structure surrounding target links. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark KGs demonstrate that S$^2$DN surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of S$^2$DN in preserving semantic consistency and enhancing the robustness of filtering out unreliable interactions in contaminated KGs.</description>

      <title>Measuring Cross-Modal Interactions in Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating AI in healthcare can greatly improve patient care and system efficiency. However, the lack of explainability in AI systems (XAI) hinders their clinical adoption, especially in multimodal settings that use increasingly complex model architectures. Most existing XAI methods focus on unimodal models, which fail to capture cross-modal interactions crucial for understanding the combined impact of multiple data sources. Existing methods for quantifying cross-modal interactions are limited to two modalities, rely on labelled data, and depend on model performance. This is problematic in healthcare, where XAI must handle multiple data sources and provide individualised explanations. This paper introduces InterSHAP, a cross-modal interaction score that addresses the limitations of existing approaches. InterSHAP uses the Shapley interaction index to precisely separate and quantify the contributions of the individual modalities and their interactions without approximations. By integrating an open-source implementation with the SHAP package, we enhance reproducibility and ease of use. We show that InterSHAP accurately measures the presence of cross-modal interactions, can handle multiple modalities, and provides detailed explanations at a local level for individual samples. Furthermore, we apply InterSHAP to multimodal medical datasets and demonstrate its applicability for individualised explanations.</description>

      <title>Improving Quantization-aware Training of Low-Precision Network via Block Replacement on Full-Precision Counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a common paradigm for network quantization, in which the training phase incorporates the simulation of the low-precision computation to optimize the quantization parameters in alignment with the task goals. However, direct training of low-precision networks generally faces two obstacles: 1. The low-precision model exhibits limited representation capabilities and cannot directly replicate full-precision calculations, which constitutes a deficiency compared to full-precision alternatives; 2. Non-ideal deviations during gradient propagation are a common consequence of employing pseudo-gradients as approximations in derived quantized functions. In this paper, we propose a general QAT framework for alleviating the aforementioned concerns by permitting the forward and backward processes of the low-precision network to be guided by the full-precision partner during training. In conjunction with the direct training of the quantization model, intermediate mixed-precision models are generated through the block-by-block replacement on the full-precision model and working simultaneously with the low-precision backbone, which enables the integration of quantized low-precision blocks into full-precision networks throughout the training phase. Consequently, each quantized block is capable of: 1. simulating full-precision representation during forward passes; 2. obtaining gradients with improved estimation during backward passes. We demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results for 4-, 3-, and 2-bit quantization on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. The proposed framework provides a compatible extension for most QAT methods and only requires a concise wrapper for existing codes.</description>

      <title>MarkovType: A Markov Decision Process Strategy for Non-Invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces Typing Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) help people with severe speech and motor disabilities communicate and interact with their environment using neural activity. This work focuses on the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm of BCIs using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). The RSVP typing task is a recursive task with multiple sequences, where users see only a subset of symbols in each sequence. Extensive research has been conducted to improve classification in the RSVP typing task, achieving fast classification. However, these methods struggle to achieve high accuracy and do not consider the typing mechanism in the learning procedure. They apply binary target and non-target classification without including recursive training. To improve performance in the classification of symbols while controlling the classification speed, we incorporate the typing setup into training by proposing a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formulate the RSVP typing task as a POMDP for recursive classification. Experiments show that the proposed approach, MarkovType, results in a more accurate typing system compared to competitors. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that while there is a trade-off between accuracy and speed, MarkovType achieves the optimal balance between these factors compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization for Unknown Cost-Varying Variable Subsets with No-Regret Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely-used method for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Traditional BO assumes that the learner has full control over all query variables without additional constraints. However, in many real-world scenarios, controlling certain query variables may incur costs. Therefore, the learner needs to balance the selection of informative subsets for targeted learning against leaving some variables to be randomly sampled to minimize costs. This problem is known as Bayesian Optimization with cost-varying variable subsets (BOCVS). While the goal of BOCVS is to identify the optimal solution with minimal cost, previous works have only guaranteed finding the optimal solution without considering the total costs incurred. Moreover, these works assume precise knowledge of the cost for each subset, which is often unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the extension of the BOCVS problem with random and unknown costs that separates the process into exploration and exploitation phases. The exploration phase will filter out low-quality variable subsets, while the exploitation phase will leverage high-quality ones. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a sub-linear rate in both quality regret and cost regret, addressing the objective of the BOCVS problem more effectively than previous analyses. Finally, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms comparable baselines across a wide range of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Statistical Modeling of Univariate Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimodality constitutes a key property indicating grouping behavior of the data around a single mode of its density. We propose a method that partitions univariate data into unimodal subsets through recursive splitting around valley points of the data density. For valley point detection, we introduce properties of critical points on the convex hull of the empirical cumulative density function (ecdf) plot that provide indications on the existence of density valleys. Next, we apply a unimodal data modeling approach that provides a statistical model for each obtained unimodal subset in the form of a Uniform Mixture Model (UMM). Consequently, a hierarchical statistical model of the initial dataset is obtained in the form of a mixture of UMMs, named as the Unimodal Mixture Model (UDMM). The proposed method is non-parametric, hyperparameter-free, automatically estimates the number of unimodal subsets and provides accurate statistical models as indicated by experimental results on clustering and density estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Learner for Precipitation Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowcasting, the short-term prediction of weather, is essential for making timely and weather-dependent decisions. Specifically, precipitation nowcasting aims to predict precipitation at a local level within a 6-hour time frame. This task can be framed as a spatial-temporal sequence forecasting problem, where deep learning methods have been particularly effective. However, despite advancements in self-supervised learning, most successful methods for nowcasting remain fully supervised. Self-supervised learning is advantageous for pretraining models to learn representations without requiring extensive labeled data. In this work, we leverage the benefits of self-supervised learning and integrate it with spatial-temporal learning to develop a novel model, SpaT-SparK. SpaT-SparK comprises a CNN-based encoder-decoder structure pretrained with a masked image modeling (MIM) task and a translation network that captures temporal relationships among past and future precipitation maps in downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the NL-50 dataset to evaluate the performance of SpaT-SparK. The results demonstrate that SpaT-SparK outperforms existing baseline supervised models, such as SmaAt-UNet, providing more accurate nowcasting predictions.</description>

      <title>RiTTA: Modeling Event Relations in Text-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: https://github.com/yuhanghe01/RiTTA</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-order algorithms that are uniformly stable for empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems that are convex and smooth with respect to $p$-norms, $p \geq 1$. We propose a black-box reduction method that, by employing properties of uniformly convex regularizers, turns an optimization algorithm for H\"older smooth convex losses into a uniformly stable learning algorithm with optimal statistical risk bounds on the excess risk, up to a constant factor depending on $p$. Achieving a black-box reduction for uniform stability was posed as an open question by (Attia and Koren, 2022), which had solved the Euclidean case $p=2$. We explore applications that leverage non-Euclidean geometry in addressing binary classification problems.</description>

      <title>Never Reset Again: A Mathematical Framework for Continual Inference in Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequential processing but face fundamental limitations with continual inference due to state saturation, requiring disruptive hidden state resets. However, reset-based methods impose synchronization requirements with input boundaries and increase computational costs at inference. To address this, we propose an adaptive loss function that eliminates the need for resets during inference while preserving high accuracy over extended sequences. By combining cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, the loss dynamically modulates the gradient based on input informativeness, allowing the network to differentiate meaningful data from noise and maintain stable representations over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our reset-free approach outperforms traditional reset-based methods when applied to a variety of RNNs, particularly in continual tasks, enhancing both the theoretical and practical capabilities of RNNs for streaming applications.</description>

      <title>CNN-LSTM Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Remaining Useful Life Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a component or a system is defined as the length from the current time to the end of the useful life. Accurate RUL estimation plays a crucial role in Predictive Maintenance applications. Traditional regression methods, both linear and non-linear, have struggled to achieve high accuracy in this domain. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown improved accuracy, they often overlook the sequential nature of the data, relying instead on features derived from sliding windows. Since RUL prediction inherently involves multivariate time series analysis, robust sequence learning is essential. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for RUL estimation. Although CNN-based LSTM models have been applied to sequence prediction tasks in financial forecasting, this is the first attempt to adopt this approach for RUL estimation in prognostics. In this approach, CNN is first employed to efficiently extract features from the data, followed by LSTM, which uses these extracted features to predict RUL. This method effectively leverages sensor sequence information, uncovering hidden patterns within the data, even under multiple operating conditions and fault scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid CNN-LSTM model achieves the highest accuracy, offering a superior score compared to the other methods.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Explanation: A Comparison of SHAP and GradCAM in Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models using eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques has become essential to make them more transparent and trustworthy. This is especially important in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where understanding model decisions is critical to ensure ethical, sound, and trustworthy outcome predictions. However, users are often confused about which explanability method to choose for their specific use case. We present a comparative analysis of widely used explainability methods, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), within the domain of human activity recognition (HAR) utilizing graph convolutional networks (GCNs). By evaluating these methods on skeleton-based data from two real-world datasets, including a healthcare-critical cerebral palsy (CP) case, this study provides vital insights into both approaches' strengths, limitations, and differences, offering a roadmap for selecting the most appropriate explanation method based on specific models and applications. We quantitatively and quantitatively compare these methods, focusing on feature importance ranking, interpretability, and model sensitivity through perturbation experiments. While SHAP provides detailed input feature attribution, GradCAM delivers faster, spatially oriented explanations, making both methods complementary depending on the application's requirements. Given the importance of XAI in enhancing trust and transparency in ML models, particularly in sensitive environments like healthcare, our research demonstrates how SHAP and GradCAM could complement each other to provide more interpretable and actionable model explanations.</description>

      <title>Fair Distributed Machine Learning with Imbalanced Data as a Stackelberg Evolutionary Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralised learning enables the training of deep learning algorithms without centralising data sets, resulting in benefits such as improved data privacy, operational efficiency and the fostering of data ownership policies. However, significant data imbalances pose a challenge in this framework. Participants with smaller datasets in distributed learning environments often achieve poorer results than participants with larger datasets. Data imbalances are particularly pronounced in medical fields and are caused by different patient populations, technological inequalities and divergent data collection practices.
  In this paper, we consider distributed learning as an Stackelberg evolutionary game. We present two algorithms for setting the weights of each node's contribution to the global model in each training round: the Deterministic Stackelberg Weighting Model (DSWM) and the Adaptive Stackelberg Weighting Model (ASWM). We use three medical datasets to highlight the impact of dynamic weighting on underrepresented nodes in distributed learning. Our results show that the ASWM significantly favours underrepresented nodes by improving their performance by 2.713% in AUC. Meanwhile, nodes with larger datasets experience only a modest average performance decrease of 0.441%.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning of Diffusion Models for Synthetic Tabular Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for privacy-preserving data analytics in finance necessitates solutions for synthetic data generation that rigorously uphold privacy standards. We introduce DP-Fed-FinDiff framework, a novel integration of Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models designed to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data. This framework ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations while maintaining data utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-Fed-FinDiff on multiple real-world financial datasets, achieving significant improvements in privacy guarantees without compromising data quality. Our empirical evaluations reveal the optimal trade-offs between privacy budgets, client configurations, and federated optimization strategies. The results affirm the potential of DP-Fed-FinDiff to enable secure data sharing and robust analytics in highly regulated domains, paving the way for further advances in federated learning and privacy-preserving data synthesis.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Multivariate Time Series Pattern Exploration: Latent Space Visual Analytics with Time Fusion Transformer and Variational Autoencoders in Power Grid Event Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and analyzing complex patterns in multivariate time-series data is crucial for decision-making in urban and environmental system operations. However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Time Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Underserved: Benchmarking LLM OCR for Low-Resource Scripts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4o, for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in low-resource scripts such as Urdu, Albanian, and Tajik, with English serving as a benchmark. Using a meticulously curated dataset of 2,520 images incorporating controlled variations in text length, font size, background color, and blur, the research simulates diverse real-world challenges. Results emphasize the limitations of zero-shot LLM-based OCR, particularly for linguistically complex scripts, highlighting the need for annotated datasets and fine-tuned models. This work underscores the urgency of addressing accessibility gaps in text digitization, paving the way for inclusive and robust OCR solutions for underserved languages.</description>

      <title>EF-Net: A Deep Learning Approach Combining Word Embeddings and Feature Fusion for Patient Disposition Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most urgent problems is the overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs), caused by an aging population and rising healthcare costs. Patient dispositions have become more complex as a result of the strain on hospital infrastructure and the scarcity of medical resources. Individuals with more dangerous health issues should be prioritized in the emergency room. Thus, our research aims to develop a prediction model for patient disposition using EF-Net. This model will incorporate categorical features into the neural network layer and add numerical features with the embedded categorical features. We combine the EF-Net and XGBoost models to attain higher accuracy in our results. The result is generated using the soft voting technique. In EF-Net, we attained an accuracy of 95.33%, whereas in the Ensemble Model, we achieved an accuracy of 96%. The experiment's analysis shows that EF-Net surpasses existing works in accuracy, AUROC, and F1-Score on the MIMIC-IV-ED dataset, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution for patient disposition assessment.

      <title>FedGAT: A Privacy-Preserving Federated Approximation Algorithm for Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated training methods have gained popularity for graph learning with applications including friendship graphs of social media sites and customer-merchant interaction graphs of huge online marketplaces. However, privacy regulations often require locally generated data to be stored on local clients. The graph is then naturally partitioned across clients, with no client permitted access to information stored on another. Cross-client edges arise naturally in such cases and present an interesting challenge to federated training methods, as training a graph model at one client requires feature information of nodes on the other end of cross-client edges. Attempting to retain such edges often incurs significant communication overhead, and dropping them altogether reduces model performance. In simpler models such as Graph Convolutional Networks, this can be fixed by communicating a limited amount of feature information across clients before training, but GATs (Graph Attention Networks) require additional information that cannot be pre-communicated, as it changes from training round to round. We introduce the Federated Graph Attention Network (FedGAT) algorithm for semi-supervised node classification, which approximates the behavior of GATs with provable bounds on the approximation error. FedGAT requires only one pre-training communication round, significantly reducing the communication overhead for federated GAT training. We then analyze the error in the approximation and examine the communication overhead and computational complexity of the algorithm. Experiments show that FedGAT achieves nearly the same accuracy as a GAT model in a centralised setting, and its performance is robust to the number of clients as well as data distribution.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.</description>

      <title>Improving the performance of weak supervision searches using data augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak supervision combines the advantages of training on real data with the ability to exploit signal properties. However, training a neural network using weak supervision often requires an excessive amount of signal data, which severely limits its practical applicability. In this study, we propose addressing this limitation through data augmentation, increasing the training data's size and diversity. Specifically, we focus on physics-inspired data augmentation methods, such as $p_{\text{T}}$ smearing and jet rotation. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation can significantly enhance the performance of weak supervision, enabling neural networks to learn efficiently from substantially less data.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Programming for Ma-Trudinger-Wang Regularity of Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given ground cost, approximating the Monge optimal transport map that pushes forward a given probability measure onto another has become a staple in several modern machine learning algorithms. The fourth-order Ma-Trudinger-Wang (MTW) tensor associated with this ground cost function provides a notion of curvature in optimal transport. The non-negativity of this tensor plays a crucial role for establishing continuity for the Monge optimal transport map. It is, however, generally difficult to analytically verify this condition for any given ground cost. To expand the class of cost functions for which MTW non-negativity can be verified, we propose a provably correct computational approach which provides certificates of non-negativity for the MTW tensor using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming. We further show that our SOS technique can also be used to compute an inner approximation of the region where MTW non-negativity holds. We apply our proposed SOS programming method to several practical ground cost functions to approximate the regions of regularity of their corresponding optimal transport maps.</description>

      <title>Investigating the importance of social vulnerability in opioid-related mortality across the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The opioid crisis remains a critical public health challenge in the United States. Despite national efforts which reduced opioid prescribing rates by nearly 45\% between 2011 and 2021, opioid overdose deaths more than tripled during this same period. Such alarming trends raise important questions about what underlying social factors may be driving opioid misuse. Using county-level data across the United States, this study begins with a preliminary data analysis of how the rates of thirteen social vulnerability index variables manifest in counties with both anomalously high and low mortality rates, identifying patterns that warrant further investigation. Building on these findings, we further investigate the importance of the thirteen SVI variables within a machine learning framework by employing two predictive models: XGBoost and a modified autoencoder. Both models take the thirteen SVI variables as input and predict county-level opioid-related mortality rates. This allows us to leverage two distinct feature importance metrics: information gain for XGBoost and a Shapley gradient explainer for the autoencoder. These metrics offer two unique insights into the most important SVI factors in relation to opioid-related mortality. By identifying the variables which consistently rank as most important, this study highlights key social vulnerability factors that may play critical roles in the opioid crisis.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks for Addressing Data Imbalance in Financial Market Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of generative adversarial networks in financial market supervision, especially for solving the problem of data imbalance to improve the accuracy of risk prediction. Since financial market data are often imbalanced, especially high-risk events such as market manipulation and systemic risk occur less frequently, traditional models have difficulty effectively identifying these minority events. This study proposes to generate synthetic data with similar characteristics to these minority events through GAN to balance the dataset, thereby improving the prediction performance of the model in financial supervision. Experimental results show that compared with traditional oversampling and undersampling methods, the data generated by GAN has significant advantages in dealing with imbalance problems and improving the prediction accuracy of the model. This method has broad application potential in financial regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch Mutual-Distillation Transformer for EEG-Based Seizure Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) based seizure subtype classification is very important in precise epilepsy diagnostics. Deep learning is a promising solution, due to its ability to automatically extract latent patterns. However, it usually requires a large amount of training data, which may not always be available in clinical practice. This paper proposes Multi-Branch Mutual-Distillation (MBMD) Transformer for cross-subject EEG-based seizure subtype classification, which can be effectively trained from small labeled data. MBMD Transformer replaces all even-numbered encoder blocks of the vanilla Vision Transformer by our designed multi-branch encoder blocks. A mutual-distillation strategy is proposed to transfer knowledge between the raw EEG data and its wavelets of different frequency bands. Experiments on two public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed MBMD Transformer outperformed several traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work on knowledge distillation for EEG-based seizure subtype classification.</description>

      <title>Dipper: Diversity in Prompts for Producing Large Language Model Ensembles in Reasoning tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models still encounter substantial challenges in reasoning tasks, especially for smaller models, which many users may be restricted to due to resource constraints (e.g. GPU memory restrictions). Inference-time methods to boost LLM performance, such as prompting methods to invoke certain reasoning pathways in responses, have been shown effective in past works, though they largely rely on sequential queries. The ensemble method, which consists of multiple constituent models running in parallel, is a promising approach to achieving better inference-time performance, especially given recent developments that enabled significant speed-ups in LLM batch inference. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free LLM ensemble framework where a single LLM model is fed an optimized, diverse set of prompts in parallel, effectively producing an ensemble at inference time to achieve performance improvement in reasoning tasks. We empirically demonstrate that our method leads to significant gains on math reasoning tasks, e.g., on MATH, where our ensemble consisting of a few small models (e.g., three Qwen2-MATH-1.5B-it models) can outperform a larger model (e.g., Qwen2-MATH-7B-it).</description>

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human feedback is crucial for their development. Existing preference optimization methods such as DPO and KTO, while improved based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are inherently derived from PPO, requiring a reference model that adds GPU memory resources and relies heavily on abundant preference data. Meanwhile, current preference optimization research mainly targets single-question scenarios with two replies, neglecting optimization with multiple replies, which leads to a waste of data in the application. This study introduces the MPPO algorithm, which leverages the average likelihood of model responses to fit the reward function and maximizes the utilization of preference data. Through a comparison of Point-wise, Pair-wise, and List-wise implementations, we found that the Pair-wise approach achieves the best performance, significantly enhancing the quality of model responses. Experimental results demonstrate MPPO's outstanding performance across various benchmarks. On MT-Bench, MPPO outperforms DPO, ORPO, and SimPO. Notably, on Arena-Hard, MPPO surpasses DPO and ORPO by substantial margins. These achievements underscore the remarkable advantages of MPPO in preference optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Literature Review: Are we there yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Literature reviews are an essential component of scientific research, but they remain time-intensive and challenging to write, especially due to the recent influx of research papers. This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning. Further, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach achieves higher-quality reviews by minimizing hallucinated references in the generated review by 18-26% compared to existing simpler LLM-based generation methods.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Text Compression Approach Using Transformer-based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text compression shrinks textual data while keeping crucial information, eradicating constraints on storage, bandwidth, and computational efficacy. The integration of lossless compression techniques with transformer-based text decompression has received negligible attention, despite the increasing volume of English text data in communication. The primary barrier in advancing text compression and restoration involves optimizing transformer-based approaches with efficient pre-processing and integrating lossless compression algorithms, that remained unresolved in the prior attempts. Here, we propose a transformer-based method named RejuvenateForme for text decompression, addressing prior issues by harnessing a new pre-processing technique and a lossless compression method. Our meticulous pre-processing technique incorporating the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm achieves compression ratios of 12.57, 13.38, and 11.42 on the BookCorpus, EN-DE, and EN-FR corpora, thus showing state-of-the-art compression ratios compared to other deep learning and traditional approaches. Furthermore, the RejuvenateForme achieves a BLEU score of 27.31, 25.78, and 50.45 on the EN-DE, EN-FR, and BookCorpus corpora, showcasing its comprehensive efficacy. In contrast, the pre-trained T5-Small exhibits better performance over prior state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Distinguish Human-written from Machine-generated Creative Fiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the universal availability of generative AI systems with the release of ChatGPT, automatic detection of deceptive text created by Large Language Models has focused on domains such as academic plagiarism and "fake news". However, generative AI also poses a threat to the livelihood of creative writers, and perhaps to literary culture in general, through reduction in quality of published material. Training a Large Language Model on writers' output to generate "sham books" in a particular style seems to constitute a new form of plagiarism. This problem has been little researched. In this study, we trained Machine Learning classifier models to distinguish short samples of human-written from machine-generated creative fiction, focusing on classic detective novels. Our results show that a Naive Bayes and a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier achieved a high degree of success (accuracy &gt; 95%), significantly outperforming human judges (accuracy &lt; 55%). This approach worked well with short text samples (around 100 words), which previous research has shown to be difficult to classify. We have deployed an online proof-of-concept classifier tool, AI Detective, as a first step towards developing lightweight and reliable applications for use by editors and publishers, with the aim of protecting the economic and cultural contribution of human authors.</description>

      <title>Structured Extraction of Real World Medical Knowledge using LLMs for Summarization and Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creation and curation of knowledge graphs can accelerate disease discovery and analysis in real-world data. While disease ontologies aid in biological data annotation, codified categories (SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT) may not capture patient condition nuances or rare diseases. Multiple disease definitions across data sources complicate ontology mapping and disease clustering. We propose creating patient knowledge graphs using large language model extraction techniques, allowing data extraction via natural language rather than rigid ontological hierarchies. Our method maps to existing ontologies (MeSH, SNOMED-CT, RxNORM, HPO) to ground extracted entities.
  Using a large ambulatory care EHR database with 33.6M patients, we demonstrate our method through the patient search for Dravet syndrome, which received ICD10 recognition in October 2020. We describe our construction of patient-specific knowledge graphs and symptom-based patient searches. Using confirmed Dravet syndrome ICD10 codes as ground truth, we employ LLM-based entity extraction to characterize patients in grounded ontologies. We then apply this method to identify Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) patients, demonstrating real-world discovery where no ground truth exists.</description>

      <title>DisEmbed: Transforming Disease Understanding through Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The medical domain is vast and diverse, with many existing embedding models focused on general healthcare applications. However, these models often struggle to capture a deep understanding of diseases due to their broad generalization across the entire medical field. To address this gap, I present DisEmbed, a disease-focused embedding model. DisEmbed is trained on a synthetic dataset specifically curated to include disease descriptions, symptoms, and disease-related Q\&amp;A pairs, making it uniquely suited for disease-related tasks. For evaluation, I benchmarked DisEmbed against existing medical models using disease-specific datasets and the triplet evaluation method. My results demonstrate that DisEmbed outperforms other models, particularly in identifying disease-related contexts and distinguishing between similar diseases. This makes DisEmbed highly valuable for disease-specific use cases, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where its performance is particularly robust.</description>

      <title>Toxicity Detection towards Adaptability to Changing Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.</description>

      <title>The Reliability Paradox: Exploring How Shortcut Learning Undermines Language Model Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has enabled significant performance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent studies have found PLMs to suffer from miscalibration, indicating a lack of accuracy in the confidence estimates provided by these models. Current evaluation methods for PLM calibration often assume that lower calibration error estimates indicate more reliable predictions. However, fine-tuned PLMs often resort to shortcuts, leading to overconfident predictions that create the illusion of enhanced performance but lack generalizability in their decision rules. The relationship between PLM reliability, as measured by calibration error, and shortcut learning, has not been thoroughly explored thus far. This paper aims to investigate this relationship, studying whether lower calibration error implies reliable decision rules for a language model. Our findings reveal that models with seemingly superior calibration portray higher levels of non-generalizable decision rules. This challenges the prevailing notion that well-calibrated models are inherently reliable. Our study highlights the need to bridge the current gap between language model calibration and generalization objectives, urging the development of comprehensive frameworks to achieve truly robust and reliable language models.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.</description>

      <title>Exploring Query Efficient Data Generation towards Data-free Model Stealing in Hard Label Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-free model stealing involves replicating the functionality of a target model into a substitute model without accessing the target model's structure, parameters, or training data. The adversary can only access the target model's predictions for generated samples. Once the substitute model closely approximates the behavior of the target model, attackers can exploit its white-box characteristics for subsequent malicious activities, such as adversarial attacks. Existing methods within cooperative game frameworks often produce samples with high confidence for the prediction of the substitute model, which makes it difficult for the substitute model to replicate the behavior of the target model. This paper presents a new data-free model stealing approach called Query Efficient Data Generation (\textbf{QEDG}). We introduce two distinct loss functions to ensure the generation of sufficient samples that closely and uniformly align with the target model's decision boundary across multiple classes. Building on the limitation of current methods, which typically yield only one piece of supervised information per query, we propose the query-free sample augmentation that enables the acquisition of additional supervised information without increasing the number of queries. Motivated by theoretical analysis, we adopt the consistency rate metric, which more accurately evaluates the similarity between the substitute and target models. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieved better performance with fewer queries compared to the state-of-the-art methods on the real \textbf{MLaaS} scenario and five datasets.</description>

Abstract: The human brain is a complex system, and understanding its mechanisms has been a long-standing challenge in neuroscience. The study of the functional connectome, which maps the functional connections between different brain regions, has provided valuable insights through various advanced analysis techniques developed over the years. Similarly, neural networks, inspired by the brain's architecture, have achieved notable success in diverse applications but are often noted for their lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that bridges neural networks and human brain functions by leveraging brain-inspired techniques. Our approach, grounded in the insights from the functional connectome, offers scalable ways to characterize topology of large neural networks using stable statistical and machine learning techniques. Our empirical analysis demonstrates its capability to enhance the interpretability of neural networks, providing a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Channel Merging: Preserving Specialization for Merged Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lately, the practice of utilizing task-specific fine-tuning has been implemented to improve the performance of large language models (LLM) in subsequent tasks. Through the integration of diverse LLMs, the overall competency of LLMs is significantly boosted. Nevertheless, traditional ensemble methods are notably memory-intensive, necessitating the simultaneous loading of all specialized models into GPU memory. To address the inefficiency, model merging strategies have emerged, merging all LLMs into one model to reduce the memory footprint during inference. Despite these advances, model merging often leads to parameter conflicts and performance decline as the number of experts increases. Previous methods to mitigate these conflicts include post-pruning and partial merging. However, both approaches have limitations, particularly in terms of performance and storage efficiency when merged experts increase. To address these challenges, we introduce Channel Merging, a novel strategy designed to minimize parameter conflicts while enhancing storage efficiency. This method clusters and merges channel parameters based on their similarity to form several groups offline. By ensuring that only highly similar parameters are merged within each group, it significantly reduces parameter conflicts. During inference, we can instantly look up the expert parameters from the merged groups, preserving specialized knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that Channel Merging consistently delivers high performance, matching unmerged models in tasks like English and Chinese reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Moreover, it obtains results comparable to model ensemble with just 53% parameters when used with a task-specific router.</description>

      <title>Maximize Your Data's Potential: Enhancing LLM Accuracy with Two-Phase Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretraining large language models effectively requires strategic data selection, blending and ordering. However, key details about data mixtures especially their scalability to longer token horizons and larger model sizes remain underexplored due to limited disclosure by model developers. To address this, we formalize the concept of two-phase pretraining and conduct an extensive systematic study on how to select and mix data to maximize model accuracies for the two phases. Our findings illustrate that a two-phase approach for pretraining outperforms random data ordering and natural distribution of tokens by 3.4% and 17% on average accuracies. We provide in-depth guidance on crafting optimal blends based on quality of the data source and the number of epochs to be seen. We propose to design blends using downsampled data at a smaller scale of 1T tokens and then demonstrate effective scaling of our approach to larger token horizon of 15T tokens and larger model size of 25B model size. These insights provide a series of steps practitioners can follow to design and scale their data blends.</description>

      <title>Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning for Best-of-N Sampling in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that effectively utilizing inference-time compute is crucial for attaining better performance from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we propose a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm, in which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly optimizes the performance of the inference-time strategy. We study this paradigm using the simple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier selects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the first imitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware fine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator within BoN. We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models implicitly learn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse responses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process reminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved performance and inference-time compute. In particular, we show that our methods improve the Bo32 performance of Gemma 2B on Hendrycks MATH from 26.8% to 30.8%, and pass@32 from 60.0% to 67.0%, as well as the pass@16 on HumanEval from 61.6% to 67.1%.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning with time-scale invariant memory</title>

Abstract: The ability to estimate temporal relationships is critical for both animals and artificial agents. Cognitive science and neuroscience provide remarkable insights into behavioral and neural aspects of temporal credit assignment. In particular, scale invariance of learning dynamics, observed in behavior and supported by neural data, is one of the key principles that governs animal perception: proportional rescaling of temporal relationships does not alter the overall learning efficiency. Here we integrate a computational neuroscience model of scale invariant memory into deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We first provide a theoretical analysis and then demonstrate through experiments that such agents can learn robustly across a wide range of temporal scales, unlike agents built with commonly used recurrent memory architectures such as LSTM. This result illustrates that incorporating computational principles from neuroscience and cognitive science into deep neural networks can enhance adaptability to complex temporal dynamics, mirroring some of the core properties of human learning.</description>

      <title>Log-Time K-Means Clustering for 1D Data: Novel Approaches with Proof and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering is a key task in machine learning, with $k$-means being widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. While 1D clustering is common, existing methods often fail to exploit the structure of 1D data, leading to inefficiencies. This thesis introduces optimized algorithms for $k$-means++ initialization and Lloyd's algorithm, leveraging sorted data, prefix sums, and binary search for improved computational performance. The main contributions are: (1) an optimized $k$-cluster algorithm achieving $O(l \cdot k^2 \cdot \log n)$ complexity for greedy $k$-means++ initialization and $O(i \cdot k \cdot \log n)$ for Lloyd's algorithm, where $l$ is the number of greedy $k$-means++ local trials, and $i$ is the number of Lloyd's algorithm iterations, and (2) a binary search-based two-cluster algorithm, achieving $O(\log n)$ runtime with deterministic convergence to a Lloyd's algorithm local minimum. Benchmarks demonstrate over 4500x speedup compared to scikit-learn for large datasets while maintaining clustering quality measured by within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). Additionally, the algorithms achieve a 300x speedup in an LLM quantization task, highlighting their utility in emerging applications. This thesis bridges theory and practice for 1D $k$-means clustering, delivering efficient and sound algorithms implemented in a JIT-optimized open-source Python library.</description>

      <title>Confidence in the Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing literature on reasoning by large language models (LLMs), but the discussion on the uncertainty in their responses is still lacking. Our aim is to assess the extent of confidence that LLMs have in their answers and how it correlates with accuracy. Confidence is measured (i) qualitatively in terms of persistence in keeping their answer when prompted to reconsider, and (ii) quantitatively in terms of self-reported confidence score. We investigate the performance of three LLMs -- GPT4o, GPT4-turbo and Mistral -- on two benchmark sets of questions on causal judgement and formal fallacies and a set of probability and statistical puzzles and paradoxes. Although the LLMs show significantly better performance than random guessing, there is a wide variability in their tendency to change their initial answers. There is a positive correlation between qualitative confidence and accuracy, but the overall accuracy for the second answer is often worse than for the first answer. There is a strong tendency to overstate the self-reported confidence score. Confidence is only partially explained by the underlying token-level probability. The material effects of prompting on qualitative confidence and the strong tendency for overconfidence indicate that current LLMs do not have any internally coherent sense of confidence.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of DSPy Teleprompter Algorithms for Aligning Large Language Models Evaluation Metrics to Human Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) optimizers are a way to align the large language model (LLM) prompts and their evaluations to the human annotations. We present a comparative analysis of five teleprompter algorithms, namely, Cooperative Prompt Optimization (COPRO), Multi-Stage Instruction Prompt Optimization (MIPRO), BootstrapFewShot, BootstrapFewShot with Optuna, and K-Nearest Neighbor Few Shot, within the DSPy framework with respect to their ability to align with human evaluations. As a concrete example, we focus on optimizing the prompt to align hallucination detection (using LLM as a judge) to human annotated ground truth labels for a publicly available benchmark dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized prompts can outperform various benchmark methods to detect hallucination, and certain telemprompters outperform the others in at least these experiments.</description>

      <title>MIETT: Multi-Instance Encrypted Traffic Transformer for Encrypted Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network traffic includes data transmitted across a network, such as web browsing and file transfers, and is organized into packets (small units of data) and flows (sequences of packets exchanged between two endpoints). Classifying encrypted traffic is essential for detecting security threats and optimizing network management. Recent advancements have highlighted the superiority of foundation models in this task, particularly for their ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data and demonstrate strong generalization to unseen data. However, existing methods that focus on token-level relationships fail to capture broader flow patterns, as tokens, defined as sequences of hexadecimal digits, typically carry limited semantic information in encrypted traffic. These flow patterns, which are crucial for traffic classification, arise from the interactions between packets within a flow, not just their internal structure. To address this limitation, we propose a Multi-Instance Encrypted Traffic Transformer (MIETT), which adopts a multi-instance approach where each packet is treated as a distinct instance within a larger bag representing the entire flow. This enables the model to capture both token-level and packet-level relationships more effectively through Two-Level Attention (TLA) layers, improving the model's ability to learn complex packet dynamics and flow patterns. We further enhance the model's understanding of temporal and flow-specific dynamics by introducing two novel pre-training tasks: Packet Relative Position Prediction (PRPP) and Flow Contrastive Learning (FCL). After fine-tuning, MIETT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across five datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying encrypted traffic and understanding complex network behaviors.

      <title>Enhancing Masked Time-Series Modeling via Dropping Patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how to enhance existing masked time-series modeling by randomly dropping sub-sequence level patches of time series. On this basis, a simple yet effective method named DropPatch is proposed, which has two remarkable advantages: 1) It improves the pre-training efficiency by a square-level advantage; 2) It provides additional advantages for modeling in scenarios such as in-domain, cross-domain, few-shot learning and cold start. This paper conducts comprehensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the method and analyze its internal mechanism. Empirically, DropPatch strengthens the attention mechanism, reduces information redundancy and serves as an efficient means of data augmentation. Theoretically, it is proved that DropPatch slows down the rate at which the Transformer representations collapse into the rank-1 linear subspace by randomly dropping patches, thus optimizing the quality of the learned representations</description>

      <title>Taming Multimodal Joint Training for High-Quality Video-to-Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to synthesize high-quality and synchronized audio, given video and optional text conditions, using a novel multimodal joint training framework MMAudio. In contrast to single-modality training conditioned on (limited) video data only, MMAudio is jointly trained with larger-scale, readily available text-audio data to learn to generate semantically aligned high-quality audio samples. Additionally, we improve audio-visual synchrony with a conditional synchronization module that aligns video conditions with audio latents at the frame level. Trained with a flow matching objective, MMAudio achieves new video-to-audio state-of-the-art among public models in terms of audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization, while having a low inference time (1.23s to generate an 8s clip) and just 157M parameters. MMAudio also achieves surprisingly competitive performance in text-to-audio generation, showing that joint training does not hinder single-modality performance.

      <title>Exploring Machine Learning Engineering for Object Detection and Tracking by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning methods it is imperative that autonomous systems will increasingly become intelligent with the inclusion of advanced machine learning algorithms to execute a variety of autonomous operations. One such task involves the design and evaluation for a subsystem of the perception system for object detection and tracking. The challenge in the creation of software to solve the task is in discovering the need for a dataset, annotation of the dataset, selection of features, integration and refinement of existing algorithms, while evaluating performance metrics through training and testing. This research effort focuses on the development of a machine learning pipeline emphasizing the inclusion of assurance methods with increasing automation. In the process, a new dataset was created by collecting videos of moving object such as Roomba vacuum cleaner, emulating search and rescue (SAR) for indoor environment. Individual frames were extracted from the videos and labeled using a combination of manual and automated techniques. This annotated dataset was refined for accuracy by initially training it on YOLOv4. After the refinement of the dataset it was trained on a second YOLOv4 and a Mask R-CNN model, which is deployed on a Parrot Mambo drone to perform real-time object detection and tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in accurately detecting and tracking the Roomba across multiple trials, achieving an average loss of 0.1942 and 96% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Urban Planning: A Hybrid Framework for Balanced City Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban planning faces a critical challenge in balancing city-wide infrastructure needs with localized demographic preferences, particularly in rapidly developing regions. Although existing approaches typically focus on top-down optimization or bottom-up community planning, only some frameworks successfully integrate both perspectives. Our methodology employs a two-tier approach: First, a deterministic solver optimizes basic infrastructure requirements in the city region. Second, four specialized planning agents, each representing distinct sub-regions, propose demographic-specific modifications to a master planner. The master planner then evaluates and integrates these suggestions to ensure cohesive urban development. We validate our framework using a newly created dataset comprising detailed region and sub-region maps from three developing cities in India, focusing on areas undergoing rapid urbanization. The results demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables more nuanced urban development while maintaining overall city functionality.</description>

      <title>Investigating Relational State Abstraction in Collaborative MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of relational state abstraction on sample efficiency and performance in collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. The proposed abstraction is based on spatial relationships in environments where direct communication between agents is not allowed, leveraging the ubiquity of spatial reasoning in real-world multi-agent scenarios. We introduce MARC (Multi-Agent Relational Critic), a simple yet effective critic architecture incorporating spatial relational inductive biases by transforming the state into a spatial graph and processing it through a relational graph neural network. The performance of MARC is evaluated across six collaborative tasks, including a novel environment with heterogeneous agents. We conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, comparing MARC against state-of-the-art MARL baselines, demonstrating improvements in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance, as well as its potential for generalization. Our findings suggest that a minimal integration of spatial relational inductive biases as abstraction can yield substantial benefits without requiring complex designs or task-specific engineering. This work provides insights into the potential of relational state abstraction to address sample efficiency, a key challenge in MARL, offering a promising direction for developing more efficient algorithms in spatially complex environments.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline. We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters, compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in addition to the other two types of topological features.</description>

      <title>Efficient Neural Network Encoding for 3D Color Lookup Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D color lookup tables (LUTs) enable precise color manipulation by mapping input RGB values to specific output RGB values. 3D LUTs are instrumental in various applications, including video editing, in-camera processing, photographic filters, computer graphics, and color processing for displays. While an individual LUT does not incur a high memory overhead, software and devices may need to store dozens to hundreds of LUTs that can take over 100 MB. This work aims to develop a neural network architecture that can encode hundreds of LUTs in a single compact representation. To this end, we propose a model with a memory footprint of less than 0.25 MB that can reconstruct 512 LUTs with only minor color distortion ($\bar{\Delta}E_M$ $\leq$ 2.0) over the entire color gamut. We also show that our network can weight colors to provide further quality gains on natural image colors ($\bar{\Delta}{E}_M$ $\leq$ 1.0). Finally, we show that minor modifications to the network architecture enable a bijective encoding that produces LUTs that are invertible, allowing for reverse color processing.

      <title>Energy consumption of code small language models serving with runtime engines and execution providers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. The rapid growth of Language Models (LMs), particularly in code generation, requires substantial computational resources, raising concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. Optimizing LMs inference for energy efficiency is crucial, and Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising solution to reduce resource demands.
  Aim. Our goal is to analyze the impact of deep learning runtime engines and execution providers on energy consumption, execution time, and computing-resource utilization from the point of view of software engineers conducting inference in the context of code SLMs.
  Method. We conducted a technology-oriented, multi-stage experimental pipeline using twelve code generation SLMs to investigate energy consumption, execution time, and computing-resource utilization across the configurations.
  Results. Significant differences emerged across configurations. CUDA execution provider configurations outperformed CPU execution provider configurations in both energy consumption and execution time. Among the configurations, TORCH paired with CUDA demonstrated the greatest energy efficiency, achieving energy savings from 37.99% up to 89.16% compared to other serving configurations. Similarly, optimized runtime engines like ONNX with the CPU execution provider achieved from 8.98% up to 72.04% energy savings within CPU-based configurations. Also, TORCH paired with CUDA exhibited efficient computing-resource utilization.
  Conclusions. Serving configuration choice significantly impacts energy efficiency. While further research is needed, we recommend the above configurations best suited to software engineers' requirements for enhancing serving efficiency in energy and performance.</description>

      <title>Learning charges and long-range interactions from energies and forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of long-range forces is critical in atomistic simulations, as they play a central role in determining the properties of materials and chemical systems. However, standard machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often rely on short-range approximations, limiting their applicability to systems with significant electrostatics and dispersion forces. We recently introduced the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which captures long-range electrostatics without explicitly learning atomic charges or charge equilibration. Extending LES, we incorporate the ability to learn physical partial charges, encode charge states, and the option to impose charge neutrality constraints. We benchmark LES on diverse and challenging systems, including charged molecules, ionic liquid, electrolyte solution, polar dipeptides, surface adsorption, electrolyte/solid interfaces, and solid-solid interfaces. Our results show that LES can effectively infer physical partial charges, dipole and quadrupole moments, as well as achieve better accuracy compared to methods that explicitly learn charges. LES thus provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable MLIP framework for simulating complex systems with intricate charge transfer and long-range</description>

      <title>TalkWithMachines: Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction for Interpretable Industrial Robotics Through Large/Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TalkWithMachines aims to enhance human-robot interaction by contributing to interpretable industrial robotic systems, especially for safety-critical applications. The presented paper investigates recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), in combination with robotic perception and control. This integration allows robots to understand and execute commands given in natural language and to perceive their environment through visual and/or descriptive inputs. Moreover, translating the LLM's internal states and reasoning into text that humans can easily understand ensures that operators gain a clearer insight into the robot's current state and intentions, which is essential for effective and safe operation. Our paper outlines four LLM-assisted simulated robotic control workflows, which explore (i) low-level control, (ii) the generation of language-based feedback that describes the robot's internal states, (iii) the use of visual information as additional input, and (iv) the use of robot structure information for generating task plans and feedback, taking the robot's physical capabilities and limitations into account. The proposed concepts are presented in a set of experiments, along with a brief discussion. Project description, videos, and supplementary materials will be available on the project website: https://talk-machines.github.io.</description>

      <title>Predicting Long-Term Student Outcomes from Short-Term EdTech Log Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Educational stakeholders are often particularly interested in sparse, delayed student outcomes, like end-of-year statewide exams. The rare occurrence of such assessments makes it harder to identify students likely to fail such assessments, as well as making it slow for researchers and educators to be able to assess the effectiveness of particular educational tools. Prior work has primarily focused on using logs from students full usage (e.g. year-long) of an educational product to predict outcomes, or considered predictive accuracy using a few minutes to predict outcomes after a short (e.g. 1 hour) session. In contrast, we investigate machine learning predictors using students' logs during their first few hours of usage can provide useful predictive insight into those students' end-of-school year external assessment. We do this on three diverse datasets: from students in Uganda using a literacy game product, and from students in the US using two mathematics intelligent tutoring systems. We consider various measures of the accuracy of the resulting predictors, including its ability to identify students at different parts along the assessment performance distribution. Our findings suggest that short-term log usage data, from 2-5 hours, can be used to provide valuable signal about students' long-term external performance.</description>

      <title>Difficulty-aware Balancing Margin Loss for Long-tailed Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When trained with severely imbalanced data, deep neural networks often struggle to accurately recognize classes with only a few samples. Previous studies in long-tailed recognition have attempted to rebalance biased learning using known sample distributions, primarily addressing different classification difficulties at the class level. However, these approaches often overlook the instance difficulty variation within each class. In this paper, we propose a difficulty-aware balancing margin (DBM) loss, which considers both class imbalance and instance difficulty. DBM loss comprises two components: a class-wise margin to mitigate learning bias caused by imbalanced class frequencies, and an instance-wise margin assigned to hard positive samples based on their individual difficulty. DBM loss improves class discriminativity by assigning larger margins to more difficult samples. Our method seamlessly combines with existing approaches and consistently improves performance across various long-tailed recognition benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Toward Appearance-based Autonomous Landing Site Identification for Multirotor Drones in Unstructured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remaining challenge in multirotor drone flight is the autonomous identification of viable landing sites in unstructured environments. One approach to solve this problem is to create lightweight, appearance-based terrain classifiers that can segment a drone's RGB images into safe and unsafe regions. However, such classifiers require data sets of images and masks that can be prohibitively expensive to create. We propose a pipeline to automatically generate synthetic data sets to train these classifiers, leveraging modern drones' ability to survey terrain automatically and the ability to automatically calculate landing safety masks from terrain models derived from such surveys. We then train a U-Net on the synthetic data set, test it on real-world data for validation, and demonstrate it on our drone platform in real-time.</description>

      <title>DualGFL: Federated Learning with a Dual-Level Coalition-Auction Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite some promising results in federated learning using game-theoretical methods, most existing studies mainly employ a one-level game in either a cooperative or competitive environment, failing to capture the complex dynamics among participants in practice. To address this issue, we propose DualGFL, a novel Federated Learning framework with a Dual-level Game in cooperative-competitive environments. DualGFL includes a lower-level hedonic game where clients form coalitions and an upper-level multi-attribute auction game where coalitions bid for training participation. At the lower-level DualGFL, we introduce a new auction-aware utility function and propose a Pareto-optimal partitioning algorithm to find a Pareto-optimal partition based on clients' preference profiles. At the upper-level DualGFL, we formulate a multi-attribute auction game with resource constraints and derive equilibrium bids to maximize coalitions' winning probabilities and profits. A greedy algorithm is proposed to maximize the utility of the central server. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate DualGFL's effectiveness in improving both server utility and client utility.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Cut Layer Selection in Split Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that combines federated learning and split learning. In SFL, a neural network is partitioned at a cut layer, with the initial layers deployed on clients and remaining layers on a training server. There are two main variants of SFL: SFL-V1 where the training server maintains separate server-side models for each client, and SFL-V2 where the training server maintains a single shared model for all clients. While existing studies have focused on algorithm development for SFL, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of how the cut layer selection affects model performance remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by providing numerical and theoretical analysis of SFL performance and convergence relative to cut layer selection. We find that SFL-V1 is relatively invariant to the choice of cut layer, which is consistent with our theoretical results. Numerical experiments on four datasets and two neural networks show that the cut layer selection significantly affects the performance of SFL-V2. Moreover, SFL-V2 with an appropriate cut layer selection outperforms FedAvg on heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>De-singularity Subgradient for the $q$-th-Powered $\ell_p$-Norm Weber Location Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Weber location problem is widely used in several artificial intelligence scenarios. However, the gradient of the objective does not exist at a considerable set of singular points. Recently, a de-singularity subgradient method has been proposed to fix this problem, but it can only handle the $q$-th-powered $\ell_2$-norm case ($1\leqslant q&lt;2$), which has only finite singular points. In this paper, we further establish the de-singularity subgradient for the $q$-th-powered $\ell_p$-norm case with $1\leqslant q\leqslant p$ and $1\leqslant p&lt;2$, which includes all the rest unsolved situations in this problem. This is a challenging task because the singular set is a continuum. The geometry of the objective function is also complicated so that the characterizations of the subgradients, minimum and descent direction are very difficult. We develop a $q$-th-powered $\ell_p$-norm Weiszfeld Algorithm without Singularity ($q$P$p$NWAWS) for this problem, which ensures convergence and the descent property of the objective function. Extensive experiments on six real-world data sets demonstrate that $q$P$p$NWAWS successfully solves the singularity problem and achieves a linear computational convergence rate in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>NGQA: A Nutritional Graph Question Answering Benchmark for Personalized Health-aware Nutritional Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diet plays a critical role in human health, yet tailoring dietary reasoning to individual health conditions remains a major challenge. Nutrition Question Answering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem. However, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the absence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits \textit{personalization}. This challenge is further compounded by the wide variability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language models (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized healthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question Answering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed for personalized nutritional health reasoning. NGQA leverages data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to evaluate whether a food is healthy for a specific user, supported by explanations of the key contributing nutrients. The benchmark incorporates three question complexity settings and evaluates reasoning across three downstream tasks. Extensive experiments with LLM backbones and baseline models demonstrate that the NGQA benchmark effectively challenges existing models. In sum, NGQA addresses a critical real-world problem while advancing GraphQA research with a novel domain-specific benchmark.</description>

      <title>Predicting Artificial Neural Network Representations to Learn Recognition Model for Music Identification from Brain Recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the representations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can exhibit notable similarities to cortical representations when subjected to identical auditory sensory inputs. In these studies, the ability to predict cortical representations is probed by regressing from ANN representations to cortical representations. Building upon this concept, our approach reverses the direction of prediction: we utilize ANN representations as a supervisory signal to train recognition models using noisy brain recordings obtained through non-invasive measurements. Specifically, we focus on constructing a recognition model for music identification, where electroencephalography (EEG) brain recordings collected during music listening serve as input. By training an EEG recognition model to predict ANN representations-representations associated with music identification-we observed a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. This study introduces a novel approach to developing recognition models for brain recordings in response to external auditory stimuli. It holds promise for advancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI), neural decoding techniques, and our understanding of music cognition. Furthermore, it provides new insights into the relationship between auditory brain activity and ANN representations.</description>

      <title>In-context Continual Learning Assisted by an External Continual Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing continual learning (CL) methods mainly rely on fine-tuning or adapting large language models (LLMs). They still suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF). Little work has been done to exploit in-context learning (ICL) to leverage the extensive knowledge within LLMs for CL without updating any parameters. However, incrementally learning each new task in ICL necessitates adding training examples from each class of the task to the prompt, which hampers scalability as the prompt length increases. This issue not only leads to excessively long prompts that exceed the input token limit of the underlying LLM but also degrades the model's performance due to the overextended context. To address this, we introduce InCA, a novel approach that integrates an external continual learner (ECL) with ICL to enable scalable CL without CF. The ECL is built incrementally to pre-select a small subset of likely classes for each test instance. By restricting the ICL prompt to only these selected classes, InCA prevents prompt lengths from becoming excessively long, while maintaining high performance. Experimental results demonstrate that InCA significantly outperforms existing CL baselines, achieving substantial performance gains.</description>

      <title>Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Sequential Satellite Assignment Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assignment problems are a classic combinatorial optimization problem in which a group of agents must be assigned to a group of tasks such that maximum utility is achieved while satisfying assignment constraints. Given the utility of each agent completing each task, polynomial-time algorithms exist to solve a single assignment problem in its simplest form. However, in many modern-day applications such as satellite constellations, power grids, and mobile robot scheduling, assignment problems unfold over time, with the utility for a given assignment depending heavily on the state of the system. We apply multi-agent reinforcement learning to this problem, learning the value of assignments by bootstrapping from a known polynomial-time greedy solver and then learning from further experience. We then choose assignments using a distributed optimal assignment mechanism rather than by selecting them directly. We demonstrate that this algorithm is theoretically justified and avoids pitfalls experienced by other RL algorithms in this setting. Finally, we show that our algorithm significantly outperforms other methods in the literature, even while scaling to realistic scenarios with hundreds of agents and tasks.</description>

      <title>SaliencyI2PLoc: saliency-guided image-point cloud localization using contrastive learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image to point cloud global localization is crucial for robot navigation in GNSS-denied environments and has become increasingly important for multi-robot map fusion and urban asset management. The modality gap between images and point clouds poses significant challenges for cross-modality fusion. Current cross-modality global localization solutions either require modality unification, which leads to information loss, or rely on engineered training schemes to encode multi-modality features, which often lack feature alignment and relation consistency. To address these limitations, we propose, SaliencyI2PLoc, a novel contrastive learning based architecture that fuses the saliency map into feature aggregation and maintains the feature relation consistency on multi-manifold spaces. To alleviate the pre-process of data mining, the contrastive learning framework is applied which efficiently achieves cross-modality feature mapping. The context saliency-guided local feature aggregation module is designed, which fully leverages the contribution of the stationary information in the scene generating a more representative global feature. Furthermore, to enhance the cross-modality feature alignment during contrastive learning, the consistency of relative relationships between samples in different manifold spaces is also taken into account. Experiments conducted on urban and highway scenario datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Specifically, our method achieves a Recall@1 of 78.92% and a Recall@20 of 97.59% on the urban scenario evaluation dataset, showing an improvement of 37.35% and 18.07%, compared to the baseline method. This demonstrates that our architecture efficiently fuses images and point clouds and represents a significant step forward in cross-modality global localization. The project page and code will be released.</description>

      <title>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Manipulation Based on Prior Dexterous Grasp Pose Knowledge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation has received considerable attention in recent research. Predominantly, existing studies have concentrated on reinforcement learning methods to address the substantial degrees of freedom in hand movements. Nonetheless, these methods typically suffer from low efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach that leverages prior dexterous grasp pose knowledge to enhance both efficiency and accuracy. Unlike previous work, they always make the robotic hand go with a fixed dexterous grasp pose, We decouple the manipulation process into two distinct phases: initially, we generate a dexterous grasp pose targeting the functional part of the object; after that, we employ reinforcement learning to comprehensively explore the environment. Our findings suggest that the majority of learning time is expended in identifying the appropriate initial position and selecting the optimal manipulation viewpoint. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning efficiency and success rates across four distinct tasks.</description>

      <title>Music Genre Classification: Ensemble Learning with Subcomponents-level Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music Genre Classification is one of the most popular topics in the fields of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) and digital signal processing. Deep Learning has emerged as the top performer for classifying music genres among various methods. The letter introduces a novel approach by combining ensemble learning with attention to sub-components, aiming to enhance the accuracy of identifying music genres. The core innovation of our work is the proposal to classify the subcomponents of the music pieces separately, allowing our model to capture distinct characteristics from those sub components. By applying ensemble learning techniques to these individual classifications, we make the final classification decision on the genre of the music. The proposed method has superior advantages in terms of accuracy compared to the other state-of-the-art techniques trained and tested on the GTZAN dataset.</description>

      <title>Microservices-Based Framework for Predictive Analytics and Real-time Performance Enhancement in Travel Reservation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a framework of microservices-based architecture dedicated to enhancing the performance of real-time travel reservation systems using the power of predictive analytics. Traditional monolithic systems are bad at scaling and performing with high loads, causing backup resources to be underutilized along with delays. To overcome the above-stated problems, we adopt a modularization approach in decoupling system components into independent services that can grow or shrink according to demand. Our framework also includes real-time predictive analytics, through machine learning models, that optimize forecasting customer demand, dynamic pricing, as well as system performance. With an experimental evaluation applying the approach, we could show that the framework impacts metrics of performance such as response time, throughput, transaction rate of success, and prediction accuracy compared to their conventional counterparts. Not only does the microservices approach improve scalability and fault tolerance like a usual architecture, but it also brings along timely and accurate predictions, which imply a greater customer satisfaction and efficiency of operation. The integration of real-time analytics would lead to more intelligent decision-making, thereby improving the response of the system along with the reliability it holds. A scalable, efficient framework is offered by such a system to address the modern challenges imposed by any form of travel reservation system while considering other complex, data-driven industries as future applications. Future work will be an investigation of advanced AI models and edge processing to further improve the performance and robustness of the systems employed.</description>

      <title>Tacit Learning with Adaptive Information Selection for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework has gained widespread adoption due to its strong performance. However, the further development of CTDE faces two key challenges. First, agents struggle to autonomously assess the relevance of input information for cooperative tasks, impairing their decision-making abilities. Second, in communication-limited scenarios with partial observability, agents are unable to access global information, restricting their ability to collaborate effectively from a global perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel cooperative MARL framework based on information selection and tacit learning. In this framework, agents gradually develop implicit coordination during training, enabling them to infer the cooperative behavior of others in a discrete space without communication, relying solely on local information. Moreover, we integrate gating and selection mechanisms, allowing agents to adaptively filter information based on environmental changes, thereby enhancing their decision-making capabilities. Experiments on popular MARL benchmarks show that our framework can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper thoroughly surveys machine learning (ML) algorithms acceleration in hardware accelerators, focusing on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It reviews 287 out of 1138 papers from the past six years, sourced from four top FPGA conferences. Such selection underscores the increasing integration of ML and FPGA technologies and their mutual importance in technological advancement. Research clearly emphasises inference acceleration (81\%) compared to training acceleration (13\%). Additionally, the findings reveals that CNN dominates current FPGA acceleration research while emerging models like GNN show obvious growth trends. The categorization of the FPGA research papers reveals a wide range of topics, demonstrating the growing relevance of ML in FPGA research. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the current trends and future directions of FPGA research in the context of ML applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GraphDOP, a new data-driven, end-to-end forecast system developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) that is trained and initialised exclusively from Earth System observations, with no physics-based (re)analysis inputs or feedbacks. GraphDOP learns the correlations between observed quantities - such as brightness temperatures from polar orbiters and geostationary satellites - and geophysical quantities of interest (that are measured by conventional observations), to form a coherent latent representation of Earth System state dynamics and physical processes, and is capable of producing skilful predictions of relevant weather parameters up to five days into the future.</description>

      <title>AIR: Unifying Individual and Cooperative Exploration in Collective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains challenging for value-based agents due to the absence of an explicit policy. Existing approaches include individual exploration based on uncertainty towards the system and collective exploration through behavioral diversity among agents. However, the introduction of additional structures often leads to reduced training efficiency and infeasible integration of these methods. In this paper, we propose Adaptive exploration via Identity Recognition~(AIR), which consists of two adversarial components: a classifier that recognizes agent identities from their trajectories, and an action selector that adaptively adjusts the mode and degree of exploration. We theoretically prove that AIR can facilitate both individual and collective exploration during training, and experiments also demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of AIR across various tasks.</description>

      <title>MacLight: Multi-scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for Traffic Signal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning methods have proposed promising traffic signal control policy that can be trained on large road networks. Current SOTA methods model road networks as topological graph structures, incorporate graph attention into deep Q-learning, and merge local and global embeddings to improve policy. However, graph-based methods are difficult to parallelize, resulting in huge time overhead. Moreover, none of the current peer studies have deployed dynamic traffic systems for experiments, which is far from the actual situation.
  In this context, we propose Multi-Scene Aggregation Convolutional Learning for traffic signal control (MacLight), which offers faster training speeds and more stable performance. Our approach consists of two main components. The first is the global representation, where we utilize variational autoencoders to compactly compress and extract the global representation. The second component employs the proximal policy optimization algorithm as the backbone, allowing value evaluation to consider both local features and global embedding representations. This backbone model significantly reduces time overhead and ensures stability in policy updates. We validated our method across multiple traffic scenarios under both static and dynamic traffic systems. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to general and domian SOTA methods, our approach achieves superior stability, optimized convergence levels and the highest time efficiency. The code is under https://github.com/Aegis1863/MacLight.</description>

      <title>The Role of Recurrency in Image Segmentation for Noisy and Limited Sample Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The biological brain has inspired multiple advances in machine learning. However, most state-of-the-art models in computer vision do not operate like the human brain, simply because they are not capable of changing or improving their decisions/outputs based on a deeper analysis. The brain is recurrent, while these models are not. It is therefore relevant to explore what would be the impact of adding recurrent mechanisms to existing state-of-the-art architectures and to answer the question of whether recurrency can improve existing architectures. To this end, we build on a feed-forward segmentation model and explore multiple types of recurrency for image segmentation. We explore self-organizing, relational, and memory retrieval types of recurrency that minimize a specific energy function. In our experiments, we tested these models on artificial and medical imaging data, while analyzing the impact of high levels of noise and few-shot learning settings. Our results do not validate our initial hypothesis that recurrent models should perform better in these settings, suggesting that these recurrent architectures, by themselves, are not sufficient to surpass state-of-the-art feed-forward versions and that additional work needs to be done on the topic.</description>

      <title>Critique of Impure Reason: Unveiling the reasoning behaviour of medical Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Latent Variable Modeling for Dynamic Friction Identification and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise identification of dynamic models in robotics is essential to support control design, friction compensation, output torque estimation, etc. A longstanding challenge remains in the identification of friction models for robotic joints, given the numerous physical phenomena affecting the underlying friction dynamics which result into nonlinear characteristics and hysteresis behaviour in particular. These phenomena proof difficult to be modelled and captured accurately using physical analogies alone. This has motivated researchers to shift from physics-based to data-driven models. Currently, these methods are still limited in their ability to generalize effectively to typical industrial robot deployement, characterized by high- and low-velocity operations and frequent direction reversals. Empirical observations motivate the use of dynamic friction models but these remain particulary challenging to establish. To address the current limitations, we propose to account for unidentified dynamics in the robot joints using latent dynamic states. The friction model may then utilize both the dynamic robot state and additional information encoded in the latent state to evaluate the friction torque. We cast this stochastic and partially unsupervised identification problem as a standard probabilistic representation learning problem. In this work both the friction model and latent state dynamics are parametrized as neural networks and integrated in the conventional lumped parameter dynamic robot model. The complete dynamics model is directly learned from the noisy encoder measurements in the robot joints. We use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to find a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the model parameters. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in terms of open-loop prediction accuracy in comparison with baseline methods, using the Kuka KR6 R700 as a test platform.</description>

      <title>GraphSeqLM: A Unified Graph Language Framework for Omic Graph Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of multi-omic data is pivotal for understanding complex diseases, but its high dimensionality and noise present significant challenges. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a robust framework for analyzing large-scale signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction networks, yet they face limitations in expressivity when capturing intricate biological relationships. To address this, we propose Graph Sequence Language Model (GraphSeqLM), a framework that enhances GNNs with biological sequence embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). These embeddings encode structural and biological properties of DNA, RNA, and proteins, augmenting GNNs with enriched features for analyzing sample-specific multi-omic data. By integrating topological, sequence-derived, and biological information, GraphSeqLM demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and outperforms existing methods, paving the way for more effective multi-omic data integration in precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Deep learning joint extremes of metocean variables using the SPAR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for estimating multivariate joint extremes of metocean variables, based on the Semi-Parametric Angular-Radial (SPAR) model. When considered in polar coordinates, the problem of modelling multivariate extremes is transformed to one of modelling an angular density, and the tail of a univariate radial variable conditioned on angle. In the SPAR approach, the tail of the radial variable is modelled using a generalised Pareto (GP) distribution, providing a natural extension of univariate extreme value theory to the multivariate setting. In this work, we show how the method can be applied in higher dimensions, using a case study for five metocean variables: wind speed, wind direction, wave height, wave period and wave direction. The angular variable is modelled empirically, while the parameters of the GP model are approximated using fully-connected deep neural networks. Our data-driven approach provides great flexibility in the dependence structures that can be represented, together with computationally efficient routines for training the model. Furthermore, the application of the method requires fewer assumptions about the underlying distribution(s) compared to existing approaches, and an asymptotically justified means for extrapolating outside the range of observations. Using various diagnostic plots, we show that the fitted models provide a good description of the joint extremes of the metocean variables considered.</description>

      <title>Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-150$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data. By sampling from the joint probability distribution and calculating its conditional entanglement entropy, we show how its underlying structure can be uncovered and interpreted. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The efficiency of the MPS-based ansatz for learning complex correlation structures from time-series data is likely to underpin interpretable advances to challenging time-series ML problems across science, industry, and medicine.</description>

      <title>On Robust Cross Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance is an effective measure of alignment between distributions supported on distinct ambient spaces. Calculating essentially the mutual departure from isometry, it has found vast usage in domain translation and network analysis. It has long been shown to be vulnerable to contamination in the underlying measures. All efforts to introduce robustness in GW have been inspired by similar techniques in optimal transport (OT), which predominantly advocate partial mass transport or unbalancing. In contrast, the cross-domain alignment problem being fundamentally different from OT, demands specific solutions to tackle diverse applications and contamination regimes. Deriving from robust statistics, we discuss three contextually novel techniques to robustify GW and its variants. For each method, we explore metric properties and robustness guarantees along with their co-dependencies and individual relations with the GW distance. For a comprehensive view, we empirically validate their superior resilience to contamination under real machine learning tasks against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>The common ground of DAE approaches. An overview of diverse DAE frameworks emphasizing their commonalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze different approaches to differential-algebraic equations with attention to the implemented rank conditions of various matrix functions. These conditions are apparently very different and certain rank drops in some matrix functions actually indicate a critical solution behavior. We look for common ground by considering various index and regularity notions from literature generalizing the Kronecker index of regular matrix pencils. In detail, starting from the most transparent reduction framework, we work out a comprehensive regularity concept with canonical characteristic values applicable across all frameworks and prove the equivalence of thirteen distinct definitions of regularity. This makes it possible to use the findings of all these concepts together. Additionally, we show why not only the index but also these canonical characteristic values are crucial to describe the properties of the DAE.</description>

      <title>IMPLY-based Approximate Full Adders for Efficient Arithmetic Operations in Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the performance limitations in modern computing, such as the power wall, emerging computing paradigms are gaining increasing importance. Approximate computing offers a promising solution by substantially enhancing energy efficiency and reducing latency, albeit with a trade-off in accuracy. Another emerging method is memristor-based In-Memory Computing (IMC) which has the potential to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck. In this work, we combine these two approaches and propose two Serial APProximate IMPLY-based full adders (SAPPI). When embedded in a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), our designs reduce the number of steps by 39%-41% and the energy consumption by 39%-42% compared to the exact algorithm. We evaluated our approach at the circuit level and compared it with State-of-the-Art (SoA) approximations where our adders improved the speed by up to 10% and the energy efficiency by up to 13%. We applied our designs in three common image processing applications where we achieved acceptable image quality with up to half of the RCA approximated.
  We performed a case study to demonstrate the applicability of our approximations in Machine Learning (ML) underscoring the potential gains in more complex scenarios. The proposed approach demonstrates energy savings of up to 296 mJ (21%) and a reduction of 1.3 billion (20%) computational steps when applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>What Are Step-Level Reward Models Rewarding? Counterintuitive Findings from MCTS-Boosted Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Step-level reward models (SRMs) can significantly enhance mathematical reasoning performance through process supervision or step-level preference alignment based on reinforcement learning. The performance of SRMs is pivotal, as they serve as critical guidelines, ensuring that each step in the reasoning process is aligned with desired outcomes. Recently, AlphaZero-like methods, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is employed for automatic step-level preference annotation, have proven particularly effective. However, the precise mechanisms behind the success of SRMs remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study delves into the counterintuitive aspects of SRMs, particularly focusing on MCTS-based approaches. Our findings reveal that the removal of natural language descriptions of thought processes has minimal impact on the efficacy of SRMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRMs are adept at assessing the complex logical coherence present in mathematical language while having difficulty in natural language. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of the core elements that drive effective step-level reward modeling in mathematical reasoning. By shedding light on these mechanisms, this study offers valuable guidance for developing more efficient and streamlined SRMs, which can be achieved by focusing on the crucial parts of mathematical reasoning.</description>

      <title>Data Preparation for Fairness-Performance Trade-Offs: A Practitioner-Friendly Alternative?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted across industries, addressing fairness and bias has become essential. While many solutions focus on ethical challenges in ML, recent studies highlight that data itself is a major source of bias. Pre-processing techniques, which mitigate bias before training, are effective but may impact model performance and pose integration difficulties. In contrast, fairness-aware Data Preparation practices are both familiar to practitioners and easier to implement, providing a more accessible approach to reducing bias. Objective. This registered report proposes an empirical evaluation of how optimally selected fairness-aware practices, applied in early ML lifecycle stages, can enhance both fairness and performance, potentially outperforming standard pre-processing bias mitigation methods. Method. To this end, we will introduce FATE, an optimization technique for selecting 'Data Preparation' pipelines that optimize fairness and performance. Using FATE, we will analyze the fairness-performance trade-off, comparing pipelines selected by FATE with results by pre-processing bias mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Mamba-based Deep Learning Approaches for Sleep Staging on a Wireless Multimodal Wearable System without Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Study Objectives: We investigate using Mamba-based deep learning approaches for sleep staging on signals from ANNE One (Sibel Health, Evanston, IL), a minimally intrusive dual-sensor wireless wearable system measuring chest electrocardiography (ECG), triaxial accelerometry, and temperature, as well as finger photoplethysmography (PPG) and temperature.
  Methods: We obtained wearable sensor recordings from 360 adults undergoing concurrent clinical polysomnography (PSG) at a tertiary care sleep lab. PSG recordings were scored according to AASM criteria. PSG and wearable sensor data were automatically aligned using their ECG channels with manual confirmation by visual inspection. We trained Mamba-based models with both convolutional-recurrent neural network (CRNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures on these recordings. Ensembling of model variants with similar architectures was performed.
  Results: Our best approach, after ensembling, attains a 3-class (wake, NREM, REM) balanced accuracy of 83.50%, F1 score of 84.16%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 72.68%, and a MCC score of 72.84%; a 4-class (wake, N1/N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 74.64%, F1 score of 74.56%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 61.63%, and MCC score of 62.04%; a 5-class (wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) balanced accuracy of 64.30%, F1 score of 66.97%, Cohen's $\kappa$ of 53.23%, MCC score of 54.38%.
  Conclusions: Deep learning models can infer major sleep stages from a wearable system without electroencephalography (EEG) and can be successfully applied to data from adults attending a tertiary care sleep clinic.</description>

      <title>Learning sparsity-promoting regularizers for linear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to learning sparsity-promoting regularizers for solving linear inverse problems. We develop a bilevel optimization framework to select an optimal synthesis operator, denoted as $B$, which regularizes the inverse problem while promoting sparsity in the solution. The method leverages statistical properties of the underlying data and incorporates prior knowledge through the choice of $B$. We establish the well-posedness of the optimization problem, provide theoretical guarantees for the learning process, and present sample complexity bounds. The approach is demonstrated through examples, including compact perturbations of a known operator and the problem of learning the mother wavelet, showcasing its flexibility in incorporating prior knowledge into the regularization framework. This work extends previous efforts in Tikhonov regularization by addressing non-differentiable norms and proposing a data-driven approach for sparse regularization in infinite dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Streaming Event-Log Prediction in Business Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Python-based framework for event-log prediction in streaming mode, enabling predictions while data is being generated by a business process. The framework allows for easy integration of streaming algorithms, including language models like n-grams and LSTMs, and for combining these predictors using ensemble methods.
  Using our framework, we conducted experiments on various well-known process-mining data sets and compared classical batch with streaming mode. Though, in batch mode, LSTMs generally achieve the best performance, there is often an n-gram whose accuracy comes very close. Combining basic models in ensemble methods can even outperform LSTMs. The value of basic models with respect to LSTMs becomes even more apparent in streaming mode, where LSTMs generally lack accuracy in the early stages of a prediction run, while basic methods make sensible predictions immediately.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) is not only intriguing intellectually but also crucial for AI-driven discovery in science, engineering, and beyond. Extensive efforts on AI4Math have mirrored techniques in NLP, in particular, training large language models on carefully curated math datasets in text form. As a complementary yet less explored avenue, formal mathematical reasoning is grounded in formal systems such as proof assistants, which can verify the correctness of reasoning and provide automatic feedback. In this position paper, we advocate for formal mathematical reasoning and argue that it is indispensable for advancing AI4Math to the next level. In recent years, we have seen steady progress in using AI to perform formal reasoning, including core tasks such as theorem proving and autoformalization, as well as emerging applications such as verifiable generation of code and hardware designs. However, significant challenges remain to be solved for AI to truly master mathematics and achieve broader impact. We summarize existing progress, discuss open challenges, and envision critical milestones to measure future success. At this inflection point for formal mathematical reasoning, we call on the research community to come together to drive transformative advancements in this field.</description>

      <title>LEDA: Log-Euclidean Diffeomorphic Autoencoder for Efficient Statistical Analysis of Diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image registration is a core task in computational anatomy that establishes correspondences between images. Invertible deformable registration, which computes a deformation field and handles complex, non-linear transformation, is essential for tracking anatomical variations, especially in neuroimaging applications where inter-subject differences and longitudinal changes are key. Analyzing the deformation fields is challenging due to their non-linearity, limiting statistical analysis. However, traditional approaches for analyzing deformation fields are computationally expensive, sensitive to initialization, and prone to numerical errors, especially when the deformation is far from the identity. To address these limitations, we propose the Log-Euclidean Diffeomorphic Autoencoder (LEDA), an innovative framework designed to compute the principal logarithm of deformation fields by efficiently predicting consecutive square roots. LEDA operates within a linearized latent space that adheres to the diffeomorphisms group action laws, enhancing our model's robustness and applicability. We also introduce a loss function to enforce inverse consistency, ensuring accurate latent representations of deformation fields. Extensive experiments with the OASIS-1 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of LEDA in accurately modeling and analyzing complex non-linear deformations while maintaining inverse consistency. Additionally, we evaluate its ability to capture and incorporate clinical variables, enhancing its relevance for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Personalized Representation from Personalized Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern vision models excel at general purpose downstream tasks. It is unclear, however, how they may be used for personalized vision tasks, which are both fine-grained and data-scarce. Recent works have successfully applied synthetic data to general-purpose representation learning, while advances in T2I diffusion models have enabled the generation of personalized images from just a few real examples. Here, we explore a potential connection between these ideas, and formalize the challenge of using personalized synthetic data to learn personalized representations, which encode knowledge about an object of interest and may be flexibly applied to any downstream task relating to the target object. We introduce an evaluation suite for this challenge, including reformulations of two existing datasets and a novel dataset explicitly constructed for this purpose, and propose a contrastive learning approach that makes creative use of image generators. We show that our method improves personalized representation learning for diverse downstream tasks, from recognition to segmentation, and analyze characteristics of image generation approaches that are key to this gain.</description>

      <title>Explicit View-labels Matter: A Multifacet Complementarity Study of Multi-view Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consistency and complementarity are two key ingredients for boosting multi-view clustering (MVC). Recently with the introduction of popular contrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further enhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the complementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the feature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion term or the independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture view-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity learning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-, view-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We empirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity learning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by existing methods. Based on this, a simple yet effective \underline{M}ultifacet \underline{C}omplementarity learning framework for \underline{M}ulti-\underline{V}iew \underline{C}lustering (MCMVC) is naturally developed, which fuses multifacet complementarity information, especially explicitly embedding the view-label information. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to use view-labels explicitly to guide the complementarity learning of views. Compared with the SOTA baselines, MCMVC achieves remarkable improvements, e.g., by average margins over $5.00\%$ and $7.00\%$ respectively in complete and incomplete MVC settings on Caltech101-20 in terms of three evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>On Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has gained prominence in operations research and machine learning as a powerful method for achieving solutions with favorable out-of-sample performance. Two compelling explanations for its success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and its equivalence to regularization schemes commonly used in machine learning. However, existing results on generalization bounds and regularization equivalence are largely limited to settings where the Wasserstein ball is of a specific type, and the decision criterion takes certain forms of expected functions. In this paper, we show that generalization bounds and regularization equivalence can be obtained in a significantly broader setting, where the Wasserstein ball is of a general type and the decision criterion accommodates any form, including general risk measures. This not only addresses important machine learning and operations management applications but also expands to general decision-theoretical frameworks previously unaddressed by Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a by-product, we show that Wasserstein DRO coincides with the recent max-sliced Wasserstein DRO for {\it any} decision criterion under affine decision rules -- resulting in both being efficiently solvable as convex programs via our general regularization results. These general assurances provide a strong foundation for expanding the application of Wasserstein DRO across diverse domains of data-driven decision problems.</description>

      <title>Spatially-aware station based car-sharing demand prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, car-sharing services have emerged as viable alternatives to private individual mobility, promising more sustainable and resource-efficient, but still comfortable transportation. Research on short-term prediction and optimization methods has improved operations and fleet control of car-sharing services; however, long-term projections and spatial analysis are sparse in the literature. We propose to analyze the average monthly demand in a station-based car-sharing service with spatially-aware learning algorithms that offer high predictive performance as well as interpretability. Our study utilizes a rich set of socio-demographic, location-based (e.g., POIs), and car-sharing-specific features as input, extracted from a large proprietary car-sharing dataset and publicly available datasets. We first compare the performance of different modeling approaches and find that a global Random Forest with geo-coordinates as part of input features achieves the highest predictive performance with an R-squared score of 0.87 on test data. While a local linear model, Geographically Weighted Regression, performs almost on par in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy. We further leverage the models to identify spatial and socio-demographic drivers of car-sharing demand. An analysis of the Random Forest via SHAP values, as well as the coefficients of GWR and MGWR models, reveals that besides population density and the car-sharing supply, other spatial features such as surrounding POIs play a major role. In addition, MGWR yields exciting insights into the multiscale heterogeneous spatial distributions of factors influencing car-sharing behaviour. Together, our study offers insights for selecting effective and interpretable methods for diagnosing and planning the placement of car-sharing stations.</description>

      <title>LayerAct: Advanced Activation Mechanism for Robust Inference of CNNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04940v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel activation mechanism called LayerAct for CNNs. This approach is motivated by our theoretical and experimental analyses, which demonstrate that Layer Normalization (LN) can mitigate a limitation of existing activation functions regarding noise robustness. However, LN is known to be disadvantageous in CNNs due to its tendency to make activation outputs homogeneous. The proposed method is designed to be more robust than existing activation functions by reducing the upper bound of influence caused by input shifts without inheriting LN's limitation. We provide analyses and experiments showing that LayerAct functions exhibit superior robustness compared to ElementAct functions. Experimental results on three clean and noisy benchmark datasets for image classification tasks indicate that LayerAct functions outperform other activation functions in handling noisy datasets while achieving superior performance on clean datasets in most cases.</description>

      <title>Augment then Smooth: Reconciling Differential Privacy with Certified Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models are susceptible to a variety of attacks that can erode trust, including attacks against the privacy of training data, and adversarial examples that jeopardize model accuracy. Differential privacy and certified robustness are effective frameworks for combating these two threats respectively, as they each provide future-proof guarantees. However, we show that standard differentially private model training is insufficient for providing strong certified robustness guarantees. Indeed, combining differential privacy and certified robustness in a single system is non-trivial, leading previous works to introduce complex training schemes that lack flexibility. In this work, we present DP-CERT, a simple and effective method that achieves both privacy and robustness guarantees simultaneously by integrating randomized smoothing into standard differentially private model training. Compared to the leading prior work, DP-CERT gives up to a 2.5% increase in certified accuracy for the same differential privacy guarantee on CIFAR10. Through in-depth per-sample metric analysis, we find that larger certifiable radii correlate with smaller local Lipschitz constants, and show that DP-CERT effectively reduces Lipschitz constants compared to other differentially private training methods.

      <title>Learning ECG Signal Features Without Backpropagation Using Linear Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLT-ECG, a novel method for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification that leverages concepts from theoretical physics to automatically generate features from time series data. Unlike traditional deep learning approaches, LLT-ECG operates in a forward manner, eliminating the need for backpropagation and hyperparameter tuning. By identifying linear laws that capture shared patterns within specific classes, the proposed method constructs a compact and verifiable representation, enhancing the effectiveness of downstream classifiers. We demonstrate LLT-ECG's state-of-the-art performance on real-world ECG datasets from PhysioNet, underscoring its potential for medical applications where speed and verifiability are crucial.</description>

      <title>Detecting Throat Cancer from Speech Signals using Machine Learning: A Scoping Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Cases of throat cancer are rising worldwide. With survival decreasing significantly at later stages, early detection is vital. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to detect throat cancer from patient speech, facilitating earlier diagnosis and reducing the burden on overstretched healthcare systems. However, no comprehensive review has explored the use of AI and ML for detecting throat cancer from speech. This review aims to fill this gap by evaluating how these technologies perform and identifying issues that need to be addressed in future research. Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping literature review across three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. We included articles that classified speech using machine learning and specified the inclusion of throat cancer patients in their data. Articles were categorized based on whether they performed binary or multi-class classification. Results: We found 27 articles fitting our inclusion criteria, 12 performing binary classification, 13 performing multi-class classification, and two that do both binary and multiclass classification. The most common classification method used was neural networks, and the most frequently extracted feature was mel-spectrograms. We also documented pre-processing methods and classifier performance. We compared each article against the TRIPOD-AI checklist, which showed a significant lack of open science, with only one article sharing code and only three using open-access data. Conclusion: Open-source code is essential for external validation and further development in this field. Our review indicates that no single method or specific feature consistently outperforms others in detecting throat cancer from speech. Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies and improving the reproducibility of results.</description>

      <title>ExpeL: LLM Agents Are Experiential Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent surge in research interest in applying large language models (LLMs) to decision-making tasks has flourished by leveraging the extensive world knowledge embedded in LLMs. While there is a growing demand to tailor LLMs for custom decision-making tasks, finetuning them for specific tasks is resource-intensive and may diminish the model's generalization capabilities. Moreover, state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 and Claude are primarily accessible through API calls, with their parametric weights remaining proprietary and unavailable to the public. This scenario emphasizes the growing need for new methodologies that allow learning from agent experiences without requiring parametric updates. To address these problems, we introduce the Experiential Learning (ExpeL) agent. Our agent autonomously gathers experiences and extracts knowledge using natural language from a collection of training tasks. At inference, the agent recalls its extracted insights and past experiences to make informed decisions. Our empirical results highlight the robust learning efficacy of the ExpeL agent, indicating a consistent enhancement in its performance as it accumulates experiences. We further explore the emerging capabilities and transfer learning potential of the ExpeL agent through qualitative observations and additional experiments.</description>

      <title>Residual Multi-Fidelity Neural Network Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the general problem of constructing a neural network surrogate model using multi-fidelity information. Motivated by error-complexity estimates for ReLU neural networks, we formulate the correlation between an inexpensive low-fidelity model and an expensive high-fidelity model as a possibly non-linear residual function. This function defines a mapping between 1) the shared input space of the models along with the low-fidelity model output, and 2) the discrepancy between the outputs of the two models. The computational framework proceeds by training two neural networks to work in concert. The first network learns the residual function on a small set of high- and low-fidelity data. Once trained, this network is used to generate additional synthetic high-fidelity data, which is used in the training of the second network. The trained second network then acts as our surrogate for the high-fidelity quantity of interest. We present four numerical examples to demonstrate the power of the proposed framework, showing that significant savings in computational cost may be achieved when the output predictions are desired to be accurate within small tolerances.</description>

      <title>Little is Enough: Boosting Privacy by Sharing Only Hard Labels in Federated Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05696v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many critical applications, sensitive data is inherently distributed and cannot be centralized due to privacy concerns. A wide range of federated learning approaches have been proposed to train models locally at each client without sharing their sensitive data, typically by exchanging model parameters, or probabilistic predictions (soft labels) on a public dataset or a combination of both. However, these methods still disclose private information and restrict local models to those that can be trained using gradient-based methods. We propose a federated co-training (FedCT) approach that improves privacy by sharing only definitive (hard) labels on a public unlabeled dataset. Clients use a consensus of these shared labels as pseudo-labels for local training. This federated co-training approach empirically enhances privacy without compromising model quality. In addition, it allows the use of local models that are not suitable for parameter aggregation in traditional federated learning, such as gradient-boosted decision trees, rule ensembles, and random forests. Furthermore, we observe that FedCT performs effectively in federated fine-tuning of large language models, where its pseudo-labeling mechanism is particularly beneficial. Empirical evaluations and theoretical analyses suggest its applicability across a range of federated learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Heat Alert Issuance with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14196v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key strategy in societal adaptation to climate change is using alert systems to prompt preventative action and reduce the adverse health impacts of extreme heat events. This paper implements and evaluates reinforcement learning (RL) as a tool to optimize the effectiveness of such systems. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce a new publicly available RL environment enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of heat alert policies to reduce heat-related hospitalizations. The rewards model is trained from a comprehensive dataset of historical weather, Medicare health records, and socioeconomic/geographic features. We use scalable Bayesian techniques tailored to the low-signal effects and spatial heterogeneity present in the data. The transition model uses real historical weather patterns enriched by a data augmentation mechanism based on climate region similarity. Second, we use this environment to evaluate standard RL algorithms in the context of heat alert issuance. Our analysis shows that policy constraints are needed to improve RL's initially poor performance. Third, a post-hoc contrastive analysis provides insight into scenarios where our modified heat alert-RL policies yield significant gains/losses over the current National Weather Service alert policy in the United States.</description>

      <title>Boosting, Voting Classifiers and Randomized Sample Compression Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In boosting, we aim to leverage multiple weak learners to produce a strong learner. At the center of this paradigm lies the concept of building the strong learner as a voting classifier, which outputs a weighted majority vote of the weak learners. While many successful boosting algorithms, such as the iconic AdaBoost, produce voting classifiers, their theoretical performance has long remained sub-optimal: The best known bounds on the number of training examples necessary for a voting classifier to obtain a given accuracy has so far always contained at least two logarithmic factors above what is known to be achievable by general weak-to-strong learners. In this work, we break this barrier by proposing a randomized boosting algorithm that outputs voting classifiers whose generalization error contains a single logarithmic dependency on the sample size. We obtain this result by building a general framework that extends sample compression methods to support randomized learning algorithms based on sub-sampling.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>

      <title>Towards Adversarially Robust Dataset Distillation by Curvature Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) allows datasets to be distilled to fractions of their original size while preserving the rich distributional information so that models trained on the distilled datasets can achieve a comparable accuracy while saving significant computational loads. Recent research in this area has been focusing on improving the accuracy of models trained on distilled datasets. In this paper, we aim to explore a new perspective of DD. We study how to embed adversarial robustness in distilled datasets, so that models trained on these datasets maintain the high accuracy and meanwhile acquire better adversarial robustness. We propose a new method that achieves this goal by incorporating curvature regularization into the distillation process with much less computational overhead than standard adversarial training. Extensive empirical experiments suggest that our method not only outperforms standard adversarial training on both accuracy and robustness with less computation overhead but is also capable of generating robust distilled datasets that can withstand various adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Reviewing AI's Role in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Recurrence Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Notorious for its 70-80% recurrence rate, Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) imposes a significant human burden and is one of the costliest cancers to manage. Current tools for predicting NMIBC recurrence rely on scoring systems that often overestimate risk and have poor accuracy. This is where Machine learning (ML)-based techniques have emerged as a promising approach for predicting NMIBC recurrence by leveraging molecular and clinical data. This comprehensive review paper critically analyses ML-based frameworks for predicting NMIBC recurrence, focusing on their statistical robustness and algorithmic efficacy. We meticulously examine the strengths and weaknesses of each study, by focusing on various prediction tasks, data modalities, and ML models, highlighting their remarkable performance alongside inherent limitations. A diverse array of ML algorithms that leverage multimodal data spanning radiomics, clinical, histopathological, and genomic data, exhibit significant promise in accurately predicting NMIBC recurrence. However, the path to widespread adoption faces challenges concerning the generalisability and interpretability of models, emphasising the need for collaborative efforts, robust datasets, and the incorporation of cost-effectiveness. Our detailed categorisation and in-depth analysis illuminate the nuances, complexities, and contexts that influence real-world advancement and adoption of these AI-based techniques. This rigorous analysis equips researchers with a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the ML algorithms employed. Researchers can use these insights to refine approaches, address limitations, and boost generalisability of their ML models, ultimately leading to reduced healthcare costs and improved patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Federated Graph Condensation with Information Bottleneck Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph condensation (GC), which reduces the size of a large-scale graph by synthesizing a small-scale condensed graph as its substitution, has benefited various graph learning tasks. However, existing GC methods rely on centralized data storage, which is unfeasible for real-world decentralized data distribution, and overlook data holders' privacy-preserving requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose and study the novel problem of federated graph condensation (FGC) for graph neural networks (GNNs). Specifically, we first propose a general framework for FGC, where we decouple the typical gradient matching process for GC into client-side gradient calculation and server-side gradient matching, integrating knowledge from multiple clients' subgraphs into one smaller condensed graph. Nevertheless, our empirical studies show that under the federated setting, the condensed graph will consistently leak data membership privacy, i.e., the condensed graph during federated training can be utilized to steal training data under the membership inference attack (MIA). To tackle this issue, we innovatively incorporate information bottleneck principles into the FGC, which only needs to extract partial node features in one local pre-training step and utilize the features during federated training. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that our framework consistently protects membership privacy during training. Meanwhile, it can achieve comparable and even superior performance against existing centralized GC and federated graph learning (FGL) methods.</description>

Abstract: Time-series representation learning is a key area of research for remote healthcare monitoring applications. In this work, we focus on a dataset of recordings of in-home activity from people living with Dementia. We design a representation learning method based on converting activity to text strings that can be encoded using a language model fine-tuned to transform data from the same participants within a $30$-day window to similar embeddings in the vector space. This allows for clustering and vector searching over participants and days, and the identification of activity deviations to aid with personalised delivery of care.</description>

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exploded in popularity in recent years. While numerous approaches have been developed, they can be broadly categorized into three main types: centralized training and execution (CTE), centralized training for decentralized execution (CTDE), and decentralized training and execution (DTE). CTE methods assume centralization during training and execution (e.g., with fast, free, and perfect communication) and have the most information during execution. CTDE methods are the most common, as they leverage centralized information during training while enabling decentralized execution -- using only information available to that agent during execution. Decentralized training and execution methods make the fewest assumptions and are often simple to implement.
  This text is an introduction to cooperative MARL -- MARL in which all agents share a single, joint reward. It is meant to explain the setting, basic concepts, and common methods for the CTE, CTDE, and DTE settings. It does not cover all work in cooperative MARL as the area is quite extensive. I have included work that I believe is important for understanding the main concepts in the area and apologize to those that I have omitted. Topics include simple applications of single-agent methods to CTE as well as some more scalable methods that exploit the multi-agent structure, independent Q-learning and policy gradient methods and their extensions, as well as value function factorization methods including the well-known VDN, QMIX, and QPLEX approaches, abd centralized critic methods including MADDPG, COMA, and MAPPO. I also discuss common misconceptions, the relationship between different approaches, and some open questions.</description>

      <title>System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Unlearning Concepts in Diffusion Model via Concept Domain Correction and Concept Preserving Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating photorealistic images. However, the inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses significant risks. Machine Unlearning (MU) offers a promising solution to eliminate sensitive concepts from these models. Despite its potential, existing MU methods face two main challenges: 1) limited generalization, where concept erasure is effective only within the unlearned set, failing to prevent sensitive concept generation from out-of-set prompts; and 2) utility degradation, where removing target concepts significantly impacts the model's overall performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel concept domain correction framework named \textbf{DoCo} (\textbf{Do}main \textbf{Co}rrection). By aligning the output domains of sensitive and anchor concepts through adversarial training, our approach ensures comprehensive unlearning of target concepts. Additionally, we introduce a concept-preserving gradient surgery technique that mitigates conflicting gradient components, thereby preserving the model's utility while unlearning specific concepts. Extensive experiments across various instances, styles, and offensive concepts demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in unlearning targeted concepts with minimal impact on related concepts, outperforming previous approaches even for out-of-distribution prompts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15332v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study estimator selection and hyper-parameter tuning in off-policy evaluation. Although cross-validation is the most popular method for model selection in supervised learning, off-policy evaluation relies mostly on theory, which provides only limited guidance to practitioners. We show how to use cross-validation for off-policy evaluation. This challenges a popular belief that cross-validation in off-policy evaluation is not feasible. We evaluate our method empirically and show that it addresses a variety of use cases.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Accuracy Trade-Offs: A Causal Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems based on machine learning may exhibit discriminatory behavior based on sensitive characteristics such as gender, sex, religion, or race. In light of this, various notions of fairness and methods to quantify discrimination were proposed, leading to the development of numerous approaches for constructing fair predictors. At the same time, imposing fairness constraints may decrease the utility of the decision-maker, highlighting a tension between fairness and utility. This tension is also recognized in legal frameworks, for instance in the disparate impact doctrine of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- in which specific attention is given to considerations of business necessity -- possibly allowing the usage of proxy variables associated with the sensitive attribute in case a high-enough utility cannot be achieved without them. In this work, we analyze the tension between fairness and accuracy from a causal lens for the first time. We introduce the notion of a path-specific excess loss (PSEL) that captures how much the predictor's loss increases when a causal fairness constraint is enforced. We then show that the total excess loss (TEL), defined as the difference between the loss of predictor fair along all causal pathways vs. an unconstrained predictor, can be decomposed into a sum of more local PSELs. At the same time, enforcing a causal constraint often reduces the disparity between demographic groups. Thus, we introduce a quantity that summarizes the fairness-utility trade-off, called the causal fairness/utility ratio, defined as the ratio of the reduction in discrimination vs. the excess loss from constraining a causal pathway. This quantity is suitable for comparing the fairness-utility trade-off across causal pathways. Finally, as our approach requires causally-constrained fair predictors, we introduce a new neural approach for causally-constrained fair learning.</description>

      <title>DiveR-CT: Diversity-enhanced Red Teaming Large Language Model Assistants with Relaxing Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model assistants have made them indispensable, raising significant concerns over managing their safety. Automated red teaming offers a promising alternative to the labor-intensive and error-prone manual probing for vulnerabilities, providing more consistent and scalable safety evaluations. However, existing approaches often compromise diversity by focusing on maximizing attack success rate. Additionally, methods that decrease the cosine similarity from historical embeddings with semantic diversity rewards lead to novelty stagnation as history grows. To address these issues, we introduce DiveR-CT, which relaxes conventional constraints on the objective and semantic reward, granting greater freedom for the policy to enhance diversity. Our experiments demonstrate DiveR-CT's marked superiority over baselines by 1) generating data that perform better in various diversity metrics across different attack success rate levels, 2) better-enhancing resiliency in blue team models through safety tuning based on collected data, 3) allowing dynamic control of objective weights for reliable and controllable attack success rates, and 4) reducing susceptibility to reward overoptimization. Overall, our method provides an effective and efficient approach to LLM red teaming, accelerating real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>CLIPLoss and Norm-Based Data Selection Methods for Multimodal Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data selection has emerged as a core issue for large-scale visual-language model pretaining (e.g., CLIP), particularly with noisy web-curated datasets. Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric). While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce surrogate-CLIPLoss (s-CLIPLoss), a CLIP loss-inspired method that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, NormSim, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data. We test our methods on the data selection benchmark, DataComp~\cite{gadre2023datacomp}. Compared to the best baseline using only OpenAI's CLIP-L/14, our methods achieve a 5.3\% improvement on ImageNet-1k and a 2.8\% improvement on 38 downstream evaluation tasks. Moreover, both s-CLIPLoss and NormSim are compatible with existing techniques. By combining our methods with the current best methods DFN and HYPE, we can boost average performance on downstream tasks by 0.9\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the DataComp-medium benchmark.</description>

      <title>BMRS: Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern neural networks are often massively overparameterized leading to high compute costs during training and at inference. One effective method to improve both the compute and energy efficiency of neural networks while maintaining good performance is structured pruning, where full network structures (e.g.~neurons or convolutional filters) that have limited impact on the model output are removed. In this work, we propose Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured pruning (BMRS), a fully end-to-end Bayesian method of structured pruning. BMRS is based on two recent methods: Bayesian structured pruning with multiplicative noise, and Bayesian model reduction (BMR), a method which allows efficient comparison of Bayesian models under a change in prior. We present two realizations of BMRS derived from different priors which yield different structured pruning characteristics: 1) BMRS_N with the truncated log-normal prior, which offers reliable compression rates and accuracy without the need for tuning any thresholds and 2) BMRS_U with the truncated log-uniform prior that can achieve more aggressive compression based on the boundaries of truncation. Overall, we find that BMRS offers a theoretically grounded approach to structured pruning of neural networks yielding both high compression rates and accuracy. Experiments on multiple datasets and neural networks of varying complexity showed that the two BMRS methods offer a competitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared to other pruning methods.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03923v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.

      <title>Faithful and Accurate Self-Attention Attribution for Message Passing Neural Networks via the Computation Tree Viewpoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been adopted in various popular message passing neural networks (MPNNs), enabling the model to adaptively control the amount of information that flows along the edges of the underlying graph. Such attention-based MPNNs (Att-GNNs) have also been used as a baseline for multiple studies on explainable AI (XAI) since attention has steadily been seen as natural model interpretations, while being a viewpoint that has already been popularized in other domains (e.g., natural language processing and computer vision). However, existing studies often use naive calculations to derive attribution scores from attention, undermining the potential of attention as interpretations for Att-GNNs. In our study, we aim to fill the gap between the widespread usage of Att-GNNs and their potential explainability via attention. To this end, we propose GATT, edge attribution calculation method for self-attention MPNNs based on the computation tree, a rooted tree that reflects the computation process of the underlying model. Despite its simplicity, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GATT in three aspects of model explanation: faithfulness, explanation accuracy, and case studies by using both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets. In all cases, the results demonstrate that GATT greatly improves edge attribution scores, especially compared to the previous naive approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/jordan7186/GAtt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. We show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network on a range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and white noise), thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. We further demonstrate that this method generalizes to residual neural networks (ResNets) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, our method illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer, which we demonstrate for both a DNN trained on MNIST and the vgg16 CNN trained on the ImageNet dataset. Our results provide a technique for significantly accelerating the training of large neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Choosing a meaningful subset of features from high-dimensional observations in unsupervised settings can greatly enhance the accuracy of downstream analysis, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction, and provide valuable insights into the sources of heterogeneity in a given dataset. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised graph-based approach for unsupervised feature selection. Our method's core involves computing robust pseudo-labels by applying simple processing steps to the graph Laplacian's eigenvectors. The subset of eigenvectors used for computing pseudo-labels is chosen based on a model stability criterion. We then measure the importance of each feature by training a surrogate model to predict the pseudo-labels from the observations. Our approach is shown to be robust to challenging scenarios, such as the presence of outliers and complex substructures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets, showing its robustness across multiple domains, particularly its effectiveness on biological datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summarizing web graphs is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the modeled information and its changes over time. We investigate the use of neural networks for lifelong graph summarization. Assuming we observe the web graph at a certain time, we train the networks to summarize graph vertices. We apply this trained network to summarize the vertices of the changed graph at the next point in time. Subsequently, we continue training and evaluating the network to perform lifelong graph summarization. We use the GNNs Graph-MLP and GraphSAINT, as well as an MLP baseline, to summarize the temporal graphs. We compare $1$-hop and $2$-hop summaries. We investigate the impact of reusing parameters from a previous snapshot by measuring the backward and forward transfer and the forgetting rate of the neural networks. Our extensive experiments on ten weekly snapshots of a web graph with over $100$M edges, sampled in 2012 and 2022, show that all networks predominantly use $1$-hop information to determine the summary, even when performing $2$-hop summarization. Due to the heterogeneity of web graphs, in some snapshots, the $2$-hop summary produces over ten times more vertex summaries than the $1$-hop summary. When using the network trained on the last snapshot from 2012 and applying it to the first snapshot of 2022, we observe a strong drop in accuracy. We attribute this drop over the ten-year time warp to the strongly increased heterogeneity of the web graph in 2022.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Ethereum Fraud Detection via Generative and Contrastive Self-supervision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rampant fraudulent activities on Ethereum hinder the healthy development of the blockchain ecosystem, necessitating the reinforcement of regulations. However, multiple imbalances involving account interaction frequencies and interaction types in the Ethereum transaction environment pose significant challenges to data mining-based fraud detection research. To address this, we first propose the concept of meta-interactions to refine interaction behaviors in Ethereum, and based on this, we present a dual self-supervision enhanced Ethereum fraud detection framework, named Meta-IFD. This framework initially introduces a generative self-supervision mechanism to augment the interaction features of accounts, followed by a contrastive self-supervision mechanism to differentiate various behavior patterns, and ultimately characterizes the behavioral representations of accounts and mines potential fraud risks through multi-view interaction feature learning. Extensive experiments on real Ethereum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework in detecting common Ethereum fraud behaviors such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams. Additionally, the generative module can effectively alleviate the interaction distribution imbalance in Ethereum data, while the contrastive module significantly enhances the framework's ability to distinguish different behavior patterns. The source code will be available in https://github.com/GISec-Team/Meta-IFD.</description>

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are neural networks with symmetry. Motivated by the theory of group representations, we decompose the layers of an equivariant neural network into simple representations. The nonlinear activation functions lead to interesting nonlinear equivariant maps between simple representations. For example, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) gives rise to piecewise linear maps. We show that these considerations lead to a filtration of equivariant neural networks, generalizing Fourier series. This observation might provide a useful tool for interpreting equivariant neural networks.</description>

We extend "Knothe's rearrangement" and "triangular transport" to probabilistic graphical models, and use this counterfactual approach, referred to as sequential transport, to discuss fairness at the individual level. After establishing the theoretical foundations of the proposed method, we demonstrate its application through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Policy Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unbiasedly evaluate multiple target policies, the dominant approach among RL practitioners is to run and evaluate each target policy separately. However, this evaluation method is far from efficient because samples are not shared across policies, and running target policies to evaluate themselves is actually not optimal. In this paper, we address these two weaknesses by designing a tailored behavior policy to reduce the variance of estimators across all target policies. Theoretically, we prove that executing this behavior policy with manyfold fewer samples outperforms on-policy evaluation on every target policy under characterized conditions. Empirically, we show our estimator has a substantially lower variance compared with previous best methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of environments.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds For Gaussian Process Regression Under Bounded Support Noise With Applications To Safety Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is a powerful and elegant method for learning complex functions from noisy data with a wide range of applications, including in safety-critical domains. Such applications have two key features: (i) they require rigorous error quantification, and (ii) the noise is often bounded and non-Gaussian due to, e.g., physical constraints. While error bounds for applying GPR in the presence of non-Gaussian noise exist, they tend to be overly restrictive and conservative in practice. In this paper, we provide novel error bounds for GPR under bounded support noise. Specifically, by relying on concentration inequalities and assuming that the latent function has low complexity in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) corresponding to the GP kernel, we derive both probabilistic and deterministic bounds on the error of the GPR. We show that these errors are substantially tighter than existing state-of-the-art bounds and are particularly well-suited for GPR with neural network kernels, i.e., Deep Kernel Learning (DKL). Furthermore, motivated by applications in safety-critical domains, we illustrate how these bounds can be combined with stochastic barrier functions to successfully quantify the safety probability of an unknown dynamical system from finite data. We validate the efficacy of our approach through several benchmarks and comparisons against existing bounds. The results show that our bounds are consistently smaller, and that DKLs can produce error bounds tighter than sample noise, significantly improving the safety probability of control systems.</description>

      <title>Assessing Modality Bias in Video Question Answering Benchmarks with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can simultaneously process visual, textual, and auditory data, capturing insights that complement human analysis. However, existing video question-answering (VidQA) benchmarks and datasets often exhibit a bias toward a single modality, despite the goal of requiring advanced reasoning skills that integrate diverse modalities to answer the queries. In this work, we introduce the modality importance score (MIS) to identify such bias. It is designed to assess which modality embeds the necessary information to answer the question. Additionally, we propose an innovative method using state-of-the-art MLLMs to estimate the modality importance, which can serve as a proxy for human judgments of modality perception. With this MIS, we demonstrate the presence of unimodal bias and the scarcity of genuinely multimodal questions in existing datasets. We further validate the modality importance score with multiple ablation studies to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on permuted feature sets. Our results indicate that current models do not effectively integrate information due to modality imbalance in existing datasets. Our proposed MLLM-derived MIS can guide the curation of modality-balanced datasets that advance multimodal learning and enhance MLLMs' capabilities to understand and utilize synergistic relations across modalities.</description>

      <title>Alt-MoE:A Scalable Framework for Bidirectional Multimodal Alignment and Efficient Knowledge Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has advanced significantly by aligning different modalities within shared latent spaces, enabling tasks such as cross-modal understanding and generation. Current alignment strategies in multimodal learning primarily include direct alignment using pre-trained or unified encoders and single-directional alignment via modality-specific connectors. Direct alignment struggles to fully leverage rich intra-modal knowledge, often requiring extensive training data to achieve cross-modal representation. Meanwhile, single-directional alignment methods, despite leveraging pre-trained knowledge, restrict task adaptability and hinder the model's ability to capture bidirectional relationships, leading to incomplete knowledge fusion and underutilization of complementary modality-specific information. To address these limitations, we introduce Alt-MoE, a scalable multimodal alignment framework that employs a mixture of experts (MoE) model as a multi-directional connector across modalities. By utilizing a sequential alternating one-way alignment strategy, Alt-MoE iteratively refines the model to achieve bidirectional alignment. Alt-MoE operates in latent space, enabling efficient vector pre-storage and real-time retrieval via MoE, optimizing large-scale data processing. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that Alt-MoE achieves competitive performance on cross-modal retrieval and visual question answering by integrating diverse modality-specific knowledge, generalizing to unseen data, and easily scaling to new tasks and modalities through dynamic adjustment of MoE capacity and expert activation.</description>

      <title>MicroFlow: An Efficient Rust-Based Inference Engine for TinyML</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant interest in developing machine learning algorithms on embedded systems. This is particularly relevant for bare metal devices in Internet of Things, Robotics, and Industrial applications that face limited memory, processing power, and storage, and which require extreme robustness. To address these constraints, we present MicroFlow, an open-source TinyML framework for the deployment of Neural Networks (NNs) on embedded systems using the Rust programming language. The compiler-based inference engine of MicroFlow, coupled with Rust's memory safety, makes it suitable for TinyML applications in critical environments. The proposed framework enables the successful deployment of NNs on highly resource-constrained devices, including bare-metal 8-bit microcontrollers with only 2kB of RAM. Furthermore, MicroFlow is able to use less Flash and RAM memory than other state-of-the-art solutions for deploying NN reference models (i.e. wake-word and person detection), achieving equally accurate but faster inference compared to existing engines on medium-size NNs, and similar performance on bigger ones. The experimental results prove the efficiency and suitability of MicroFlow for the deployment of TinyML models in critical environments where resources are particularly limited.</description>

      <title>Replacing Paths with Connection-Biased Attention for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) completion aims to identify additional facts that can be inferred from the existing facts in the KG. Recent developments in this field have explored this task in the inductive setting, where at test time one sees entities that were not present during training; the most performant models in the inductive setting have employed path encoding modules in addition to standard subgraph encoding modules. This work similarly focuses on KG completion in the inductive setting, without the explicit use of path encodings, which can be time-consuming and introduces several hyperparameters that require costly hyperparameter optimization. Our approach uses a Transformer-based subgraph encoding module only; we introduce connection-biased attention and entity role embeddings into the subgraph encoding module to eliminate the need for an expensive and time-consuming path encoding module. Evaluations on standard inductive KG completion benchmark datasets demonstrate that our \textbf{C}onnection-\textbf{B}iased \textbf{Li}nk \textbf{P}rediction (CBLiP) model has superior performance to models that do not use path information. Compared to models that utilize path information, CBLiP shows competitive or superior performance while being faster. Additionally, to show that the effectiveness of connection-biased attention and entity role embeddings also holds in the transductive setting, we compare CBLiP's performance on the relation prediction task in the transductive setting.</description>

Abstract: Julia has been heralded as a potential successor to Python for scientific machine learning and numerical computing, boasting ergonomic and performance improvements. Since Julia's inception in 2012 and declaration of language goals in 2017, its ecosystem and language-level features have grown tremendously. In this paper, we take a modern look at Julia's features and ecosystem, assess the current state of the language, and discuss its viability and pitfalls as a replacement for Python as the de-facto scientific machine learning language. We call for the community to address Julia's language-level issues that are preventing further adoption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear and unstable aerodynamic interference generated by the tandem wings of such biomimetic systems poses substantial challenges for motion control, especially under multiple random operating conditions. To address these challenges, the Concerto Reinforcement Learning Extension (CRL2E) algorithm has been developed. This plug-and-play, fully on-the-job, real-time reinforcement learning algorithm incorporates a novel Physics-Inspired Rule-Based Policy Composer Strategy with a Perturbation Module alongside a lightweight network optimized for real-time control. To validate the performance and the rationality of the module design, experiments were conducted under six challenging operating conditions, comparing seven different algorithms. The results demonstrate that the CRL2E algorithm achieves safe and stable training within the first 500 steps, improving tracking accuracy by 14 to 66 times compared to the Soft Actor-Critic, Proximal Policy Optimization, and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. Additionally, CRL2E significantly enhances performance under various random operating conditions, with improvements in tracking accuracy ranging from 8.3% to 60.4% compared to the Concerto Reinforcement Learning (CRL) algorithm. The convergence speed of CRL2E is 36.11% to 57.64% faster than the CRL algorithm with only the Composer Perturbation and 43.52% to 65.85% faster than the CRL algorithm when both the Composer Perturbation and Time-Interleaved Capability Perturbation are introduced, especially in conditions where the standard CRL struggles to converge. Hardware tests indicate that the optimized lightweight network structure excels in weight loading and average inference time, meeting real-time control requirements.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains Genomic Models with Near-zero Marginal Cost for Future Queried Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of large-scale machine learning models in genomics, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. While Shapley values explain model predictions locally for an individual input query sequence, extracting biological knowledge requires global explanation across thousands of input sequences. This demands exponential model evaluations per sequence, resulting in significant computational cost and carbon footprint. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, a method that estimates Shapley values and interactions with a near-zero marginal cost for future queried sequences after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley values and interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcome, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing almost all predictive motifs -- a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible interactions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01757v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples-those without spurious correlations-and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive optimization algorithms, particularly Adam and its variant AdamW, are fundamental components of modern deep learning. However, their training dynamics lack comprehensive theoretical understanding, with limited insight into why common practices -- such as specific hyperparameter choices and normalization layers -- contribute to successful generalization. This work presents a continuous-time formulation of Adam and AdamW, facilitating a tractable analysis of training dynamics that can shed light on such practical questions. We theoretically derive a stable region for Adam's hyperparameters $(\beta, \gamma)$ that ensures bounded updates, empirically verifying these predictions by observing unstable exponential parameter growth outside of this stable region. Furthermore, we theoretically justify the success of normalization layers by uncovering an implicit meta-adaptive effect of scale-invariant architectural components. This insight leads to an explicit optimizer, $2$-Adam, which we generalize to $k$-Adam -- an optimizer that applies an adaptive normalization procedure $k$ times, encompassing Adam (corresponding to $k=1$) and Adam with a normalization layer (corresponding to $k=2$). Overall, our continuous-time formulation of Adam facilitates a principled analysis, offering deeper understanding of optimal hyperparameter choices and architectural decisions in modern deep learning.</description>

Abstract: Forecasters using flexible neural networks (NN) in multi-horizon distributional regression setups often struggle to gain detailed insights into the underlying mechanisms that lead to the predicted feature-conditioned distribution parameters. In this work, we deploy a Neural Basis Model for Location, Scale and Shape, that blends the principled interpretability of GAMLSS with a computationally scalable shared basis decomposition, combined by linear projections supporting dedicated stepwise and parameter-wise feature shape functions aggregations. Experiments have been conducted on multiple market regions, achieving probabilistic forecasting performance comparable to that of distributional neural networks, while providing more insights into the model behavior through the learned nonlinear feature level maps to the distribution parameters across the prediction steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges. X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from tessellated geometry files (e.g., STLs) by generating point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus.</description>

      <title>Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.</description>

Abstract: Ensemble learning has proven effective in improving predictive performance and estimating uncertainty in neural networks. However, conventional ensemble methods often suffer from redundant parameter usage and computational inefficiencies due to entirely independent network training. To address these challenges, we propose the Divergent Ensemble Network (DEN), a novel architecture that combines shared representation learning with independent branching. DEN employs a shared input layer to capture common features across all branches, followed by divergent, independently trainable layers that form an ensemble. This shared-to-branching structure reduces parameter redundancy while maintaining ensemble diversity, enabling efficient and scalable learning.</description>

      <title>MAPLE: A Framework for Active Preference Learning Guided by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in using natural language for preference learning. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational burdens, taxing human supervision, and lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce MAPLE, a framework for large language model-guided Bayesian active preference learning. MAPLE leverages LLMs to model the distribution over preference functions, conditioning it on both natural language feedback and conventional preference learning feedback, such as pairwise trajectory rankings. MAPLE also employs active learning to systematically reduce uncertainty in this distribution and incorporates a language-conditioned active query selection mechanism to identify informative and easy-to-answer queries, thus reducing human burden. We evaluate MAPLE's sample efficiency and preference inference quality across two benchmarks, including a real-world vehicle route planning benchmark using OpenStreetMap data. Our results demonstrate that MAPLE accelerates the learning process and effectively improves humans' ability to answer queries.</description>

      <title>Why Does Dropping Edges Usually Outperform Adding Edges in Graph Contrastive Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used as an effective self-supervised learning method for graph representation learning. However, how to apply adequate and stable graph augmentation to generating proper views for contrastive learning remains an essential problem. Dropping edges is a primary augmentation in GCL while adding edges is not a common method due to its unstable performance. To our best knowledge, there is no theoretical analysis to study why dropping edges usually outperforms adding edges. To answer this question, we introduce a new metric, namely Error Passing Rate (EPR), to quantify how a graph fits the network. Inspired by the theoretical conclusions and the idea of positive-incentive noise, we propose a novel GCL algorithm, Error-PAssing-based Graph Contrastive Learning (EPAGCL), which uses both edge adding and edge dropping as its augmentations. To be specific, we generate views by adding and dropping edges based on the weights derived from EPR. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets are conducted to validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hyzhang98/EPAGCL.</description>

      <title>RWKV-edge: Deeply Compressed RWKV for Resource-Constrained Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To deploy LLMs on resource-contained platforms such as mobile robotics and wearables, non-transformers LLMs have achieved major breakthroughs. Recently, a novel RNN-based LLM family, Repentance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) models have shown promising results in text generation on resource-constrained devices thanks to their computational efficiency. However, these models remain too large to be deployed on embedded devices due to their high parameter count. In this paper, we propose an efficient suite of compression techniques, tailored to the RWKV architecture. These techniques include low-rank approximation, sparsity predictors, and clustering head, designed to align with the model size. Our methods compress the RWKV models by 4.95--3.8x with only 2.95pp loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>MGDA: Model-based Goal Data Augmentation for Offline Goal-conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a state-of-the-art family of algorithms, known as Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL) methods, has been introduced to tackle challenges in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL optimizes a lower bound of the goal-conditioned RL objective and has demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse goal-reaching tasks, providing a simple, effective, and stable solution. However, prior research has identified a critical limitation of GCWSL: the lack of trajectory stitching capabilities. To address this, goal data augmentation strategies have been proposed to enhance these methods. Nevertheless, existing techniques often struggle to sample suitable augmented goals for GCWSL effectively. In this paper, we establish unified principles for goal data augmentation, focusing on goal diversity, action optimality, and goal reachability. Based on these principles, we propose a Model-based Goal Data Augmentation (MGDA) approach, which leverages a learned dynamics model to sample more suitable augmented goals. MGDA uniquely incorporates the local Lipschitz continuity assumption within the learned model to mitigate the impact of compounding errors. Empirical results show that MGDA significantly enhances the performance of GCWSL methods on both state-based and vision-based maze datasets, surpassing previous goal data augmentation techniques in improving stitching capabilities.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Matrices: Combining for a More Efficient and Effective Foundation Model Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to make the foundation model more efficient and effective, our idea is combining sequence transformation and state transformation. First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.</description>

      <title>Posterior Mean Matching: Generative Modeling through Online Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces posterior mean matching (PMM), a new method for generative modeling that is grounded in Bayesian inference. PMM uses conjugate pairs of distributions to model complex data of various modalities like images and text, offering a flexible alternative to existing methods like diffusion models. PMM models iteratively refine noisy approximations of the target distribution using updates from online Bayesian inference. PMM is flexible because its mechanics are based on general Bayesian models. We demonstrate this flexibility by developing specialized examples: a generative PMM model of real-valued data using the Normal-Normal model, a generative PMM model of count data using a Gamma-Poisson model, and a generative PMM model of discrete data using a Dirichlet-Categorical model. For the Normal-Normal PMM model, we establish a direct connection to diffusion models by showing that its continuous-time formulation converges to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Additionally, for the Gamma-Poisson PMM, we derive a novel SDE driven by a Cox process, which is a significant departure from traditional Brownian motion-based generative models. PMMs achieve performance that is competitive with generative models for language modeling and image generation.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Detection in Imbalanced Multi-Class Datasets Using an Optimal MIP-Based Ensemble Weighting Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the challenges of imbalanced multi-class datasets typically used for rare event detection in critical cyber-physical systems, we propose an optimal, efficient, and adaptable mixed integer programming (MIP) ensemble weighting scheme. Our approach leverages the diverse capabilities of the classifier ensemble on a granular per class basis, while optimizing the weights of classifier-class pairs using elastic net regularization for improved robustness and generalization. Additionally, it seamlessly and optimally selects a predefined number of classifiers from a given set. We evaluate and compare our MIP-based method against six well-established weighting schemes, using representative datasets and suitable metrics, under various ensemble sizes. The experimental results reveal that MIP outperforms all existing approaches, achieving an improvement in balanced accuracy ranging from 0.99% to 7.31%, with an overall average of 4.53% across all datasets and ensemble sizes. Furthermore, it attains an overall average increase of 4.63%, 4.60%, and 4.61% in macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score, respectively, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Federated Unlearning Model Recovery in Data with Skewed Label Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In federated learning, federated unlearning is a technique that provides clients with a rollback mechanism that allows them to withdraw their data contribution without training from scratch. However, existing research has not considered scenarios with skewed label distributions. Unfortunately, the unlearning of a client with skewed data usually results in biased models and makes it difficult to deliver high-quality service, complicating the recovery process. This paper proposes a recovery method of federated unlearning with skewed label distributions. Specifically, we first adopt a strategy that incorporates oversampling with deep learning to supplement the skewed class data for clients to perform recovery training, therefore enhancing the completeness of their local datasets. Afterward, a density-based denoising method is applied to remove noise from the generated data, further improving the quality of the remaining clients' datasets. Finally, all the remaining clients leverage the enhanced local datasets and engage in iterative training to effectively restore the performance of the unlearning model. Extensive evaluations on commonly used federated learning datasets with varying degrees of skewness show that our method outperforms baseline methods in restoring the performance of the unlearning model, particularly regarding accuracy on the skewed class.</description>

      <title>Personalized Clustering via Targeted Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering traditionally aims to reveal a natural grouping structure within unlabeled data. However, this structure may not always align with users' preferences. In this paper, we propose a personalized clustering method that explicitly performs targeted representation learning by interacting with users via modicum task information (e.g., $\textit{must-link}$ or $\textit{cannot-link}$ pairs) to guide the clustering direction. We query users with the most informative pairs, i.e., those pairs most hard to cluster and those most easy to miscluster, to facilitate the representation learning in terms of the clustering preference. Moreover, by exploiting attention mechanism, the targeted representation is learned and augmented. By leveraging the targeted representation and constrained contrastive loss as well, personalized clustering is obtained. Theoretically, we verify that the risk of personalized clustering is tightly bounded, guaranteeing that active queries to users do mitigate the clustering risk. Experimentally, extensive results show that our method performs well across different clustering tasks and datasets, even when only a limited number of queries are available.</description>

      <title>SSE-SAM: Balancing Head and Tail Classes Gradually through Stage-Wise SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where vast majority of classes known as tail classes have only few samples. Traditional methods tend to overfit on these tail classes. Recently, a new approach called Imbalanced SAM (ImbSAM) is proposed to leverage the generalization benefits of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for long-tailed distributions. The main strategy is to merely enhance the smoothness of the loss function for tail classes. However, we argue that improving generalization in long-tail scenarios requires a careful balance between head and tail classes. We show that neither SAM nor ImbSAM alone can fully achieve this balance. For SAM, we prove that although it enhances the model's generalization ability by escaping saddle point in the overall loss landscape, it does not effectively address this for tail-class losses. Conversely, while ImbSAM is more effective at avoiding saddle points in tail classes, the head classes are trained insufficiently, resulting in significant performance drops. Based on these insights, we propose Stage-wise Saddle Escaping SAM (SSE-SAM), which uses complementary strengths of ImbSAM and SAM in a phased approach. Initially, SSE-SAM follows the majority sample to avoid saddle points of the head-class loss. During the later phase, it focuses on tail-classes to help them escape saddle points. Our experiments confirm that SSE-SAM has better ability in escaping saddles both on head and tail classes, and shows performance improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dyna-style off-policy model-based reinforcement learning (DMBRL) algorithms are a family of techniques for generating synthetic state transition data and thereby enhancing the sample efficiency of off-policy RL algorithms. This paper identifies and investigates a surprising performance gap observed when applying DMBRL algorithms across different benchmark environments with proprioceptive observations. We show that, while DMBRL algorithms perform well in OpenAI Gym, their performance can drop significantly in DeepMind Control Suite (DMC), even though these settings offer similar tasks and identical physics backends. Modern techniques designed to address several key issues that arise in these settings do not provide a consistent improvement across all environments, and overall our results show that adding synthetic rollouts to the training process -- the backbone of Dyna-style algorithms -- significantly degrades performance across most DMC environments. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of several fundamental challenges in model-based RL and show that, like many optimization fields, there is no free lunch when evaluating performance across diverse benchmarks in RL.</description>

      <title>LoLaFL: Low-Latency Federated Learning via Forward-only Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for enabling edge learning with distributed data while ensuring data privacy. However, the traditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly meet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile networks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model parameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required for convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To address this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding rate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant white-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency Federated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables layer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication rounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two \emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on the proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be harmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures of the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of features to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison with traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can achieve reductions in latency of over 91\% and 98\%, respectively, while maintaining comparable accuracies.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Release and Learning of Threshold Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:1504.07553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of $(\epsilon, \delta)$ differentially private algorithms for releasing approximate answers to threshold functions. A threshold function $c_x$ over a totally ordered domain $X$ evaluates to $c_x(y) = 1$ if $y \le x$, and evaluates to $0$ otherwise. We give the first nontrivial lower bound for releasing thresholds with $(\epsilon,\delta)$ differential privacy, showing that the task is impossible over an infinite domain $X$, and moreover requires sample complexity $n \ge \Omega(\log^*|X|)$, which grows with the size of the domain. Inspired by the techniques used to prove this lower bound, we give an algorithm for releasing thresholds with $n \le 2^{(1+ o(1))\log^*|X|}$ samples. This improves the previous best upper bound of $8^{(1 + o(1))\log^*|X|}$ (Beimel et al., RANDOM '13).
  Our sample complexity upper and lower bounds also apply to the tasks of learning distributions with respect to Kolmogorov distance and of properly PAC learning thresholds with differential privacy. The lower bound gives the first separation between the sample complexity of properly learning a concept class with $(\epsilon,\delta)$ differential privacy and learning without privacy. For properly learning thresholds in $\ell$ dimensions, this lower bound extends to $n \ge \Omega(\ell \cdot \log^*|X|)$.
  To obtain our results, we give reductions in both directions from releasing and properly learning thresholds and the simpler interior point problem. Given a database $D$ of elements from $X$, the interior point problem asks for an element between the smallest and largest elements in $D$. We introduce new recursive constructions for bounding the sample complexity of the interior point problem, as well as further reductions and techniques for proving impossibility results for other basic problems in differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Learning Low Degree Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a hypergraph via edge detecting queries. In this problem, a learner queries subsets of vertices of a hidden hypergraph and observes whether these subsets contain an edge or not. In general, learning a hypergraph with $m$ edges of maximum size $d$ requires $\Omega((2m/d)^{d/2})$ queries. In this paper, we aim to identify families of hypergraphs that can be learned without suffering from a query complexity that grows exponentially in the size of the edges.
  We show that hypermatchings and low-degree near-uniform hypergraphs with $n$ vertices are learnable with poly$(n)$ queries. For learning hypermatchings (hypergraphs of maximum degree $ 1$), we give an $O(\log^3 n)$-round algorithm with $O(n \log^5 n)$ queries. We complement this upper bound by showing that there are no algorithms with poly$(n)$ queries that learn hypermatchings in $o(\log \log n)$ adaptive rounds. For hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ and edge size ratio $\rho$, we give a non-adaptive algorithm with $O((2n)^{\rho \Delta+1}\log^2 n)$ queries. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms with poly$(n, m)$ query complexity for learning non-trivial families of hypergraphs that have a super-constant number of edges of super-constant size.</description>

      <title>Variational measurement-based quantum computation for generative modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) offers a fundamentally unique paradigm to design quantum algorithms. Indeed, due to the inherent randomness of quantum measurements, the natural operations in MBQC are not deterministic and unitary, but are rather augmented with probabilistic byproducts. Yet, the main algorithmic use of MBQC so far has been to completely counteract this probabilistic nature in order to simulate unitary computations expressed in the circuit model. In this work, we propose designing MBQC algorithms that embrace this inherent randomness and treat the random byproducts in MBQC as a resource for computation. As a natural application where randomness can be beneficial, we consider generative modeling, a task in machine learning centered around generating complex probability distributions. To address this task, we propose a variational MBQC algorithm equipped with control parameters that allow one to directly adjust the degree of randomness to be admitted in the computation. Our algebraic and numerical findings indicate that this additional randomness can lead to significant gains in expressivity and learning performance for certain generative modeling tasks, respectively. These results highlight the potential advantages in exploiting the inherent randomness of MBQC and motivate further research into MBQC-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Linear Regression Models for Opinion Formation in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider public health officials aiming to spread awareness about a new vaccine in a community interconnected by a social network. How can they distribute information with minimal resources, so as to avoid polarization and ensure community-wide convergence of opinion? To tackle such challenges, we initiate the study of sample complexity of opinion convergence in networks. Our framework is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard the opinion of each agent as a data-derived model, unlike previous works that treat opinions as data-independent scalars. The opinion model for every agent is initially learned from its local samples and evolves game-theoretically as all agents communicate with neighbors and revise their models towards an equilibrium. Our focus is on the sample complexity needed to ensure that the opinions converge to an equilibrium such that the final model of every agent has low generalization error.
  Our paper has two main technical results. First, we present a novel polynomial time optimization framework to quantify the total sample complexity for arbitrary networks, when the underlying learning problem is (generalized) linear regression. Second, we leverage this optimization to study the network gain which measures the improvement of sample complexity when learning over a network compared to that in isolation. Towards this end, we derive network gain bounds for various network classes including cliques, star graphs, and random regular graphs. Additionally, our framework provides a method to study sample distribution within the network, suggesting that it is sufficient to allocate samples inversely to the degree. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world networks strongly support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Named Entity Recognition: A Comprehensive Survey and Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition seeks to extract substrings within a text that name real-world objects and to determine their type (for example, whether they refer to persons or organizations). In this survey, we first present an overview of recent popular approaches, including advancements in Transformer-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) that have not had much coverage in other surveys. In addition, we discuss reinforcement learning and graph-based approaches, highlighting their role in enhancing NER performance. Second, we focus on methods designed for datasets with scarce annotations. Third, we evaluate the performance of the main NER implementations on a variety of datasets with differing characteristics (as regards their domain, their size, and their number of classes). We thus provide a deep comparison of algorithms that have never been considered together. Our experiments shed some light on how the characteristics of datasets affect the behavior of the methods we compare.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Probabilistic Battery Health Management Approach for Robust Inspection Drone Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Health monitoring of remote critical infrastructure is a complex and expensive activity due to the limited infrastructure accessibility. Inspection drones are ubiquitous assets that enhance the reliability of critical infrastructures through improved accessibility. However, due to the harsh operation environment, it is crucial to monitor their health to ensure successful inspection operations. The battery is a key component that determines the overall reliability of the inspection drones and, with an appropriate health management approach, contributes to reliable and robust inspections. In this context, this paper presents a novel hybrid probabilistic approach for battery end-of-discharge (EOD) voltage prediction of Li-Po batteries. The hybridization is achieved in an error-correction configuration, which combines physics-based discharge and probabilistic error-correction models to quantify the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The performance of the hybrid probabilistic methodology was empirically evaluated on a dataset comprising EOD voltage under varying load conditions. The dataset was obtained from real inspection drones operated on different flights, focused on offshore wind turbine inspections. The proposed approach has been tested with different probabilistic methods and demonstrates 14.8% improved performance in probabilistic accuracy compared to the best probabilistic method. In addition, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties provide robust estimations to enhance the diagnosis of battery health-states.</description>

      <title>LLM Processes: Numerical Predictive Distributions Conditioned on Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses. Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</description>

      <title>Local Causal Discovery for Structural Evidence of Direct Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the causal pathways of unfairness is a critical objective for improving policy design and algorithmic decision-making. Prior work in causal fairness analysis often requires knowledge of the causal graph, hindering practical applications in complex or low-knowledge domains. Moreover, global discovery methods that learn causal structure from data can display unstable performance on finite samples, preventing robust fairness conclusions. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce local discovery for direct discrimination (LD3): a method that uncovers structural evidence of direct unfairness by identifying the causal parents of an outcome variable. LD3 performs a linear number of conditional independence tests relative to variable set size, and allows for latent confounding under the sufficient condition that all parents of the outcome are observed. We show that LD3 returns a valid adjustment set (VAS) under a new graphical criterion for the weighted controlled direct effect, a qualitative indicator of direct discrimination. LD3 limits unnecessary adjustment, providing interpretable VAS for assessing unfairness. We use LD3 to analyze causal fairness in two complex decision systems: criminal recidivism prediction and liver transplant allocation. LD3 was more time-efficient and returned more plausible results on real-world data than baselines, which took 46$\times$ to 5870$\times$ longer to execute.</description>

      <title>Factor Augmented Tensor-on-Tensor Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the prediction task of tensor-on-tensor regression in which both covariates and responses are multi-dimensional arrays (a.k.a., tensors) across time with arbitrary tensor order and data dimension. Existing methods either focused on linear models without accounting for possibly nonlinear relationships between covariates and responses, or directly employed black-box deep learning algorithms that failed to utilize the inherent tensor structure. In this work, we propose a Factor Augmented Tensor-on-Tensor Neural Network (FATTNN) that integrates tensor factor models into deep neural networks. We begin with summarizing and extracting useful predictive information (represented by the ``factor tensor'') from the complex structured tensor covariates, and then proceed with the prediction task using the estimated factor tensor as input of a temporal convolutional neural network. The proposed methods effectively handle nonlinearity between complex data structures, and improve over traditional statistical models and conventional deep learning approaches in both prediction accuracy and computational cost. By leveraging tensor factor models, our proposed methods exploit the underlying latent factor structure to enhance the prediction, and in the meantime, drastically reduce the data dimensionality that speeds up the computation. The empirical performances of our proposed methods are demonstrated via simulation studies and real-world applications to three public datasets. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantial increases in prediction accuracy and significant reductions in computational time compared to benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Low-Resource Machine Translation through the Lens of Personalized Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach called MeritOpt based on the Personalized Federated Learning algorithm MeritFed that can be applied to Natural Language Tasks with heterogeneous data. We evaluate it on the Low-Resource Machine Translation task, using the datasets of South East Asian and Finno-Ugric languages. In addition to its effectiveness, MeritOpt is also highly interpretable, as it can be applied to track the impact of each language used for training. Our analysis reveals that target dataset size affects weight distribution across auxiliary languages, that unrelated languages do not interfere with the training, and auxiliary optimizer parameters have minimal impact. Our approach is easy to apply with a few lines of code, and we provide scripts for reproducing the experiments at https://github.com/VityaVitalich/MeritOpt.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Task Vectors Enable Many-Shot Multimodal In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

      <title>Adaptive Prediction Ensemble: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving often struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, sometimes performing worse than simple rule-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving. More details can be found on the project page: https://sites.google.com/view/ape-generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and analyzing lengthy sequential inputs, owing to their extensive context windows that allow processing millions of tokens in a single forward pass. However, this paper uncovers a surprising limitation: LLMs fall short when handling long input sequences. We investigate this issue using three datasets and two tasks (sentiment analysis and news categorization) across various LLMs, including Claude 3, Gemini Pro, GPT 3.5 Turbo, Llama 3 Instruct, and Mistral Instruct models. To address this limitation, we propose and evaluate ad-hoc solutions that substantially enhance LLMs' performance on long input sequences by up to 50%, while reducing API cost and latency by up to 93% and 50%, respectively.</description>

      <title>GeoTransformer: Enhancing Urban Forecasting with Dependency Retrieval and Geospatial Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in urban forecasting have leveraged high-dimensional spatial data through two primary approaches: graph-based methods that rely on predefined spatial structures and region-based methods that use satellite imagery for local features. Although these methods have laid an important foundation, they struggle to integrate holistic urban information and dynamically model spatial dependencies. To address this gap, we propose GeoTransformer, a framework combining high-dimensional regional embeddings with dynamic spatial modeling. GeoTransformer features two innovations: (1) a dependency retrieval module identifying spatial dependencies to select relevant regions, and (2) a geospatial attention mechanism leveraging global urban information. These components unify structural and global urban information for better predictions. Extensive experiments on GDP and ride-share demand forecasting show that GeoTransformer outperforms baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing urban forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>mRNA2vec: mRNA Embedding with Language Model in the 5'UTR-CDS for mRNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are accelerating the discovery of new drugs and revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. However, selecting particular mRNA sequences for vaccines and therapeutics from extensive mRNA libraries is costly. Effective mRNA therapeutics require carefully designed sequences with optimized expression levels and stability. This paper proposes a novel contextual language model (LM)-based embedding method: mRNA2vec. In contrast to existing mRNA embedding approaches, our method is based on the self-supervised teacher-student learning framework of data2vec. We jointly use the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) region as the input sequences. We adapt our LM-based approach specifically to mRNA by 1) considering the importance of location on the mRNA sequence with probabilistic masking, 2) using Minimum Free Energy (MFE) prediction and Secondary Structure (SS) classification as additional pretext tasks. mRNA2vec demonstrates significant improvements in translation efficiency (TE) and expression level (EL) prediction tasks in UTR compared to SOTA methods such as UTR-LM. It also gives a competitive performance in mRNA stability and protein production level tasks in CDS such as CodonBERT.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the statistical performance of a robust spectral clustering method for latent structure recovery in noisy data matrices. We consider eigenvector-based clustering applied to a matrix of nonparametric rank statistics that is derived entrywise from the raw, original data matrix. This approach is robust in the sense that, unlike traditional spectral clustering procedures, it can provably recover population-level latent block structure even when the observed data matrix includes heavy-tailed entries and has a heterogeneous variance profile.
  Our main theoretical contributions are threefold and hold under flexible data generating conditions. First, we establish that robust spectral clustering with rank statistics can consistently recover latent block structure, viewed as communities of nodes in a graph, in the sense that unobserved community memberships for all but a vanishing fraction of nodes are correctly recovered with high probability when the data matrix is large. Second, we refine the former result and further establish that, under certain conditions, the community membership of any individual, specified node of interest can be asymptotically exactly recovered with probability tending to one in the large-data limit. Third, we establish asymptotic normality results associated with the truncated eigenstructure of matrices whose entries are rank statistics, made possible by synthesizing contemporary entrywise matrix perturbation analysis with the classical nonparametric theory of so-called simple linear rank statistics. Collectively, these results demonstrate the statistical utility of rank-based data transformations when paired with spectral techniques for dimensionality reduction. Additionally, for a dataset of human connectomes, our approach yields parsimonious dimensionality reduction and improved recovery of ground-truth neuroanatomical cluster structure.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Embedding by Approximate Equitable Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</description>

      <title>Fields of The World: A Machine Learning Benchmark Dataset For Global Agricultural Field Boundary Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crop field boundaries are foundational datasets for agricultural monitoring and assessments but are expensive to collect manually. Machine learning (ML) methods for automatically extracting field boundaries from remotely sensed images could help realize the demand for these datasets at a global scale. However, current ML methods for field instance segmentation lack sufficient geographic coverage, accuracy, and generalization capabilities. Further, research on improving ML methods is restricted by the lack of labeled datasets representing the diversity of global agricultural fields. We present Fields of The World (FTW) -- a novel ML benchmark dataset for agricultural field instance segmentation spanning 24 countries on four continents (Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America). FTW is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets with 70,462 samples, each containing instance and semantic segmentation masks paired with multi-date, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. We provide results from baseline models for the new FTW benchmark, show that models trained on FTW have better zero-shot and fine-tuning performance in held-out countries than models that aren't pre-trained with diverse datasets, and show positive qualitative zero-shot results of FTW models in a real-world scenario -- running on Sentinel-2 scenes over Ethiopia.</description>

      <title>The Clear Sky Corridor: Insights Towards Aerosol Formation in Exoplanets Using An AI-based Survey of Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure. Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes. Surveying 42 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar, novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin (depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across a broader wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Masked Diffusion Models on Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown promise in language modeling, yet their scalability and effectiveness in core language tasks, such as text generation and language understanding, remain underexplored. This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective unsupervised classifier-free guidance that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference. In language understanding, the 1.1B MDM outperforms the 1.1B TinyLlama model trained on the same data across four of eight zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, it achieves competitive math reasoning ability with the 7B Llama-2 model on the GSM8K dataset. In text generation, MDMs provide a flexible trade-off compared to ARMs utilizing KV-cache: MDMs match the performance of ARMs while being 1.4 times faster or achieving higher quality than ARMs at a higher computational cost. Moreover, MDMs address challenging tasks for ARMs by effectively handling bidirectional reasoning and adapting to temporal shifts in data. Notably, a 1.1B MDM breaks the reverse curse encountered by much larger ARMs with significantly more data and computation, such as 13B Llama-2 and 175B GPT-3.

      <title>DroidSpeak: KV Cache Sharing for Cross-LLM Communication and Multi-LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in complex workflows, where different LLMs and fine-tuned variants collaboratively address complex tasks. However, these systems face significant inefficiencies due to redundant context processing of the shared context. We propose DroidSpeak, a framework that optimizes context sharing between fine-tuned LLMs derived from the same foundational model. DroidSpeak identifies critical layers in the KV cache and selectively recomputes them, enabling effective reuse of intermediate data while maintaining high accuracy.
  Our approach balances computational efficiency and task fidelity, significantly reducing inference latency and throughput bottlenecks. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 3x higher throughputs and 2.6x faster prefill times with negligible accuracy loss compared to full recomputation.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>

      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Guidance for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance is an error-correcting technique used to improve the perceptual quality of images generated by diffusion models. Typically, the correction is achieved by linear extrapolation, using an auxiliary diffusion model that has lower performance than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar errors as the primary one but stronger. We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity. The result is a novel guidance method, which we call sliding window guidance (SWG), that guides the primary model with itself by constraining its receptive field. Intriguingly, SWG aligns better with human preferences than state-of-the-art guidance methods while requiring neither training, architectural modifications, nor class conditioning. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>Best-of-N Jailbreaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prompting for Continual Relation Extraction: A Within-Task Variance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Relation Extraction (CRE), many current approaches rely on memory buffers to rehearse previously learned knowledge while acquiring new tasks. Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as potent alternatives to rehearsal-based strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, upon analyzing existing prompt-based approaches for CRE, we identified several critical limitations, such as inaccurate prompt selection, inadequate mechanisms for mitigating forgetting in shared parameters, and suboptimal handling of cross-task and within-task variances. To overcome these challenges, we draw inspiration from the relationship between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts, proposing a novel approach that employs a prompt pool for each task, capturing variations within each task while enhancing cross-task variances. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative model to consolidate prior knowledge within shared parameters, eliminating the need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-free methods in continual relation extraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acquiring, processing, and visualizing geospatial data requires significant computing resources, especially for large spatio-temporal domains. This challenge hinders the rapid discovery of predictive features, which is essential for advancing geospatial modeling. To address this, we developed Similarity Search (Sims), a no-code web tool that allows users to perform clustering and similarity search over defined regions of interest using Google Earth Engine as a backend. Sims is designed to complement existing modeling tools by focusing on feature exploration rather than model creation. We demonstrate the utility of Sims through a case study analyzing simulated maize yield data in Rwanda, where we evaluate how different combinations of soil, weather, and agronomic features affect the clustering of yield response zones. Sims is open source and available at https://github.com/microsoft/Sims</description>

      <title>Client-Side Patching against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a versatile framework for training models in decentralized environments. However, the trust placed in clients makes federated learning vulnerable to backdoor attacks launched by malicious participants. While many defenses have been proposed, they often fail short when facing heterogeneous data distributions among participating clients. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for federated learning systems designed to mitigate backdoor attacks on the clients-side. Our approach leverages adversarial learning techniques and model patching to neutralize the impact of backdoor attacks. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our defense effectively reduces backdoor accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses, such as LFighter, FLAME, and RoseAgg, in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios, while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy on clean data.</description>

      <title>Scientific Realism vs. Anti-Realism: Toward a Common Ground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The debate between scientific realism and anti-realism remains at a stalemate, making reconciliation seem hopeless. Yet, important work remains: exploring a common ground, even if only to uncover deeper points of disagreement and, ideally, to benefit both sides of the debate. I propose such a common ground. Specifically, many anti-realists, such as instrumentalists, have yet to seriously engage with Sober's call to justify their preferred version of Ockham's razor through a positive account. Meanwhile, realists face a similar challenge: providing a non-circular explanation of how their version of Ockham's razor connects to truth. The common ground I propose addresses these challenges for both sides; the key is to leverage the idea that everyone values some truths and to draw on insights from scientific fields that study scientific inference -- namely, statistics and machine learning. This common ground also isolates a distinctively epistemic root of the irreconcilability in the realism debate.</description>

      <title>SoftVQ-VAE: Efficient 1-Dimensional Continuous Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient image tokenization with high compression ratios remains a critical challenge for training generative models. We present SoftVQ-VAE, a continuous image tokenizer that leverages soft categorical posteriors to aggregate multiple codewords into each latent token, substantially increasing the representation capacity of the latent space. When applied to Transformer-based architectures, our approach compresses 256x256 and 512x512 images using as few as 32 or 64 1-dimensional tokens. Not only does SoftVQ-VAE show consistent and high-quality reconstruction, more importantly, it also achieves state-of-the-art and significantly faster image generation results across different denoising-based generative models. Remarkably, SoftVQ-VAE improves inference throughput by up to 18x for generating 256x256 images and 55x for 512x512 images while achieving competitive FID scores of 1.78 and 2.21 for SiT-XL. It also improves the training efficiency of the generative models by reducing the number of training iterations by 2.3x while maintaining comparable performance. With its fully-differentiable design and semantic-rich latent space, our experiment demonstrates that SoftVQ-VAE achieves efficient tokenization without compromising generation quality, paving the way for more efficient generative models. Code and model are released.</description>

      <title>Learning Massive-scale Partial Correlation Networks in Clinical Multi-omics Studies with HP-ACCORD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical model estimation from modern multi-omics data requires a balance between statistical estimation performance and computational scalability. We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested in simulated data with up to one million variables demonstrating complex dependency structures akin to biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data showed superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenomic regulation, demonstrating the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis. %derived from the gene expression data.</description>

      <title>ManiSkill-HAB: A Benchmark for Low-Level Manipulation in Home Rearrangement Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality benchmarks are the foundation for embodied AI research, enabling significant advancements in long-horizon navigation, manipulation and rearrangement tasks. However, as frontier tasks in robotics get more advanced, they require faster simulation speed, more intricate test environments, and larger demonstration datasets. To this end, we present MS-HAB, a holistic benchmark for low-level manipulation and in-home object rearrangement. First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against. Finally, we develop a rule-based trajectory filtering system to sample specific demonstrations from our RL policies which match predefined criteria for robot behavior and safety. Combining demonstration filtering with our fast environments enables efficient, controlled data generation at scale.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>Alignment faking in large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.</description>

      <title>Permutation recovery of spikes in noisy high-dimensional tensor estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of gradient flow in high dimensions for the multi-spiked tensor problem, where the goal is to estimate $r$ unknown signal vectors (spikes) from noisy Gaussian tensor observations. Specifically, we analyze the maximum likelihood estimation procedure, which involves optimizing a highly nonconvex random function. We determine the sample complexity required for gradient flow to efficiently recover all spikes, without imposing any assumptions on the separation of the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). More precisely, our results provide the sample complexity required to guarantee recovery of the spikes up to a permutation. Our work builds on our companion paper [Ben Arous, Gerbelot, Piccolo 2024], which studies Langevin dynamics and determines the sample complexity and separation conditions for the SNRs necessary for ensuring exact recovery of the spikes (where the recovered permutation matches the identity). During the recovery process, the correlations between the estimators and the hidden vectors increase in a sequential manner. The order in which these correlations become significant depends on their initial values and the corresponding SNRs, which ultimately determines the permutation of the recovered spikes.</description>
