      <title>Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA), effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration. This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection". VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features, together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD, through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework. First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically, guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.</description>

      <title>A Dataset Generation Scheme Based on Video2EEG-SPGN-Diffusion for SEED-VD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source framework, Video2EEG-SPGN-Diffusion, that leverages the SEED-VD dataset to generate a multimodal dataset of EEG signals conditioned on video stimuli. Additionally, we disclose an engineering pipeline for aligning video and EEG data pairs, facilitating the training of multimodal large models with EEG alignment capabilities. Personalized EEG signals are generated using a self-play graph network (SPGN) integrated with a diffusion model. As a major contribution, we release a new dataset comprising over 1000 samples of SEED-VD video stimuli paired with generated 62-channel EEG signals at 200 Hz and emotion labels, enabling video-EEG alignment and advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with substantial research and engineering significance.</description>

      <title>Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses (or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC, which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs, offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC.</description>

      <title>Optical Music Recognition of Jazz Lead Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and models.</description>

      <title>RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass (i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with "4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions, and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time, Vision-Based System for Badminton Smash Speed Estimation on Mobile Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel, cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels to analyze and improve their game.</description>

      <title>A Stroke-Level Large-Scale Database of Chinese Character Handwriting and the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for Handwriting Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical, and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally, we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters and sub-characters across different languages.</description>

      <title>Anticipatory Fall Detection in Humans with Hybrid Directed Graph Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls, the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states: stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state, offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced assistance systems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Hard and Soft Clustering for Precise Brain Tumor Segmentation in MR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association. Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset, incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of 0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.</description>

      <title>Handling imbalance and few-sample size in ML based Onion disease classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than other approaches using the same datasets.</description>

      <title>Delta Velocity Rectified Flow for Text-to-Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free, path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/gaspardbd/DeltaVelocityRectifiedFlow.</description>

      <title>Systematic Integration of Attention Modules into CNNs for Accurate and Generalizable Medical Image Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however, conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets. Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Object Detection for UAV Solar Panel Inspection Using an Enhanced Defects Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model. These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection approaches in practical solar panel monitoring and maintenance scenarios.
  The dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/IsuruMunasinghe98/solar-panel-inspection-dataset.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Instance Segmentation with Superpixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications, including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving. Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Augmented Structure Preserving Neural Networks for cell biomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes, ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools (Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the same observed features.</description>

      <title>Advanced Brain Tumor Segmentation Using EMCAD: Efficient Multi-scale Convolutional Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources. However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs. To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset consisting of MRI scans from 369 brain tumor patients. The preliminary result obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a stable mean Dice score of 0.285 plus/minus 0.015 throughout the training process which is moderate. The initial model maintained consistent performance across the validation set without showing signs of over-fitting.</description>

      <title>FAVAE-Effective Frequency Aware Latent Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions, due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sensitivity Filter Pruning using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning For DCNN's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion, and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics, identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70 percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70 percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy, surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient deployment on edge and mobile platforms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Veriserum is an open-source dataset designed to support the training of deep learning registration for dual-plane fluoroscopic analysis. It comprises approximately 110,000 X-ray images of 10 knee implant pair combinations (2 femur and 5 tibia implants) captured during 1,600 trials, incorporating poses associated with daily activities such as level gait and ramp descent. Each image is annotated with an automatically registered ground-truth pose, while 200 images include manually registered poses for benchmarking.
  Key features of Veriserum include dual-plane images and calibration tools. The dataset aims to support the development of applications such as 2D/3D image registration, image segmentation, X-ray distortion correction, and 3D reconstruction. Freely accessible, Veriserum aims to advance computer vision and medical imaging research by providing a reproducible benchmark for algorithm development and evaluation. The Veriserum dataset used in this study is publicly available via https://movement.ethz.ch/data-repository/veriserum.html, with the data stored at ETH Z\"urich Research Collections: https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000701146.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Layer-Freezing Strategies for Enhanced Transfer Learning in YOLO Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth, dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but, rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical, evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in scenarios with limited resources.</description>

      <title>Quaternion Approximation Networks for Enhanced Image Classification and Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO, DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and application in other domains.</description>

      <title>OpenEgo: A Large-Scale Multimodal Egocentric Dataset for Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric human videos provide scalable demonstrations for imitation learning, but existing corpora often lack either fine-grained, temporally localized action descriptions or dexterous hand annotations. We introduce OpenEgo, a multimodal egocentric manipulation dataset with standardized hand-pose annotations and intention-aligned action primitives. OpenEgo totals 1107 hours across six public datasets, covering 290 manipulation tasks in 600+ environments. We unify hand-pose layouts and provide descriptive, timestamped action primitives. To validate its utility, we train language-conditioned imitation-learning policies to predict dexterous hand trajectories. OpenEgo is designed to lower the barrier to learning dexterous manipulation from egocentric video and to support reproducible research in vision-language-action learning. All resources and instructions will be released at www.openegocentric.com.</description>

      <title>Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently surpassing existing works.</description>

      <title>DuoCLR: Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning for Skeleton-based Human Action Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting representations of the same action class across different permutations, while ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific Disentangled Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Aware Post-Training Quantization for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters, leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a 20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline, with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and Reenactment Separated Method for Realistic Gaussian Head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MFFI: Multi-Dimensional Face Forgery Image Dataset for Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes, richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image (\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$ image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability, and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The dataset and additional details are publicly available at {https://github.com/inclusionConf/MFFI}.</description>

      <title>Language-guided Recursive Spatiotemporal Graph Modeling for Video Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs, respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe. In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised and unsupervised manners. The code is available at https://github.com/park-jungin/videograph.</description>

      <title>Patch-level Kernel Alignment for Self-Supervised Dense Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>SpecPrune-VLA: Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Models via Action-Aware Self-Speculative Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior actions, causing &gt;20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local (current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level: prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed), adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs. OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.</description>

      <title>SuMa: A Subspace Mapping Approach for Robust and Effective Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed. However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results that are on par with methods targeting completeness.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Learning for Hyperspectral Images of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties as tree representations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating YOLO Architectures: Implications for Real-Time Vehicle Detection in Urban Environments of Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</description>

      <title>EditIDv2: Editable ID Customization with Data-Lubricated ID Feature Integration for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench evaluation.</description>

      <title>OOTSM: A Decoupled Linguistic Framework for Effective Scene Graph Anticipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves dramatically by 21.9%.

      <title>WIPUNet: A Physics-inspired Network with Weighted Inductive Biases for Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by "pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept: rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at $\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise. Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii) demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA machinery.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Multi-Turn Visual-Textual Reasoning in LVLMs via Dynamic Memory and Adaptive Visual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following (MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>MeshMetrics: A Precise Implementation of Distance-Based Image Segmentation Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former, the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention. Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package, available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Vision-Language Large Models for Interpretable Video Action Recognition with Semantic Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding, complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition, emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B) for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set), but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural language explanations for its predictions.</description>

      <title>JRN-Geo: A Joint Perception Network based on RGB and Normal images for Cross-view Geo-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images. Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features.

      <title>Knowledge-Augmented Vision Language Models for Underwater Bioacoustic Spectrogram Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine mammal vocalization analysis depends on interpreting bioacoustic spectrograms. Vision Language Models (VLMs) are not trained on these domain-specific visualizations. We investigate whether VLMs can extract meaningful patterns from spectrograms visually. Our framework integrates VLM interpretation with LLM-based validation to build domain knowledge. This enables adaptation to acoustic data without manual annotation or model retraining.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-BIND-T: Improving SLAM with Temporally Consistent Cross-Modal LiDAR Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space, with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for downstream SLAM.</description>

      <title>Multi-LVI-SAM: A Robust LiDAR-Visual-Inertial Odometry for Multiple Fisheye Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework, Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.</description>

      <title>Depth-Aware Super-Resolution via Distance-Adaptive Variational Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges. Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.</description>

      <title>InterAct: A Large-Scale Dataset of Dynamic, Expressive and Interactive Activities between Two People in Daily Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured. InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs. Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .</description>

      <title>Unleashing Hierarchical Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Framework for Training-Free Referring Video Object Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content, particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object. \textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.</description>

      <title>PictOBI-20k: Unveiling Large Multimodal Models in Visual Decipherment for Pictographic Oracle Bone Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars, offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over 15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.</description>

      <title>Posterior shape models revisited: Improving 3D reconstructions from partial data using target specific models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions, particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance. It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable in plug-and-play scenarios.</description>

      <title>3DPillars: Pillar-based two-stage 3D object detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient, PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations, narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First, we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using 3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively, and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.</description>

      <title>CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward Projection based View Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB (Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in 3D object detection.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Deep Anomaly Detection for Medical Manufacturing: Structural Similarity and Feature Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection, yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy, efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations. The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference, enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement, outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tbwa233/Probabilistic-SAM/.</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Dust Aerosol Detection with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks on MODIS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based models may further sharpen edges.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Deep Learning-Based Small Organ Segmentation: A Benchmarking Perspective for Medical Research with Limited Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis. However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net, DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models (SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful clinical utility.</description>

      <title>BTCChat: Advancing Remote Sensing Bi-temporal Change Captioning with Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis, previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks.</description>

      <title>A Fine-Grained Attention and Geometric Correspondence Model for Musculoskeletal Risk Classification in Athletes Using Multimodal Visual and Skeletal Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations. ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of 93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of 93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of 0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions in sports.</description>

      <title>Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Coefficients-Preserving Sampling for Reinforcement Learning with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

      <title>Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively.

      <title>StripDet: Strip Attention-Based Lightweight 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Neural Bloom: A Deep Learning Approach to Real-Time Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling, also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation. These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%. These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future. This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining high-quality realism.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Aware Self-Supervision for Medical 3D Imaging with Multi-Granularity Observable Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging. Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies, while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.</description>

      <title>OmniStyle2: Scalable and High Quality Artistic Style Transfer Data Generation via Destylization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural, style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style transfer.</description>

      <title>ConstStyle: Robust Domain Generalization with Unified Style Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains. To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Strategy Guided Diffusion via Sparse Masking Temporal Reweighting Distribution Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information. The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.</description>

      <title>S-LAM3D: Segmentation-Guided Monocular 3D Object Detection via Feature Space Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one. Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene: pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can balance the need for additional sensors or training data.</description>

      <title>Motion Aware ViT-based Framework for Monocular 6-DoF Spacecraft Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers 6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.</description>

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning. Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels, each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification, segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian cuisine.

      <title>BLaVe-CoT: Consistency-Aware Visual Question Answering for Blind and Low Vision Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see. As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers, each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer, and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings. This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Enhancement and Benchmark for UAV-based Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000 instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images). Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Micro-Expression Recognition via Fine-Grained Dynamic Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions. Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation. Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image. The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11% over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM, CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/CYF-cuber/FDP.</description>

      <title>DVLO4D: Deep Visual-Lidar Odometry with Sparse Spatial-temporal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment, fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency, with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Blood Report Images Using General Purpose Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of 100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications. While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the limited dataset size.</description>

      <title>TinyDef-DETR:An Enhanced DETR Detector for UAV Power Line Defect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects. Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets, while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.</description>

      <title>BranchGRPO: Stable and Efficient GRPO with Structured Branching in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment. However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Graph Neural Networks for Data-Driven Prediction of Natural Convection in Enclosed Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data, particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090 GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1) Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), that employs cross-attention for skip connections, providing superior feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a viable path toward democratizing high-quality text-to-image generation for individual researchers and smaller organizations with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Tomographic Image Reconstruction Integrating Neural Networks and Mathematical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&amp;G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks. Code will be released.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</description>

      <title>CARDIE: clustering algorithm on relevant descriptors for image enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our GitHub.</description>

      <title>SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity. Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification and burnt area segmentation.</description>

      <title>RetinaGuard: Obfuscating Retinal Age in Fundus Images for Biometric Privacy Preserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.</description>

      <title>UniVerse-1: Unified Audio-Video Generation via Stitching of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations. Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.</description>

      <title>UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Applied Innovation for Fracture Detection in X-rays Using Custom CNN and Transfer Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset. Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation for clinical translation</description>

      <title>Exploring Light-Weight Object Recognition for Real-Time Document Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions: improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model. Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system. The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while retaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

      <title>Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data. Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view environments.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Remote Facial Skin Hydration and TEWL Assessment from Selfie Images: A Systematic Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function: skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly, diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens. However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression. Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e, scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1) imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding. Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.</description>

      <title>Video-based Generalized Category Discovery via Memory-Guided Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However, relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Text4Seg++: Advancing Image Segmentation via Generative Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks. To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the MLLM framework.</description>

      <title>Towards scalable organ level 3D plant segmentation: Bridging the data algorithm computing gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general 3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains, ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio (PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv) conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping.

      <title>Quantitative Currency Evaluation in Low-Resource Settings through Pattern Analysis to Assist Visually Impaired Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI, BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs. Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.</description>

      <title>Multi View Slot Attention Using Paraphrased Texts For Face Anti-Spoofing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens, failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text. MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

      <title>A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Colorectal Pathology Diagnosis: Integrating Histological and Colonoscopy Data in a Pilot Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset. The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.</description>

      <title>MRD-LiNet: A Novel Lightweight Hybrid CNN with Gradient-Guided Unlearning for Improved Drought Stress Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management. Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification; however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters, restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings. To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.</description>

      <title>Your Super Resolution Model is not Enough for Tackling Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet, HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>AI-based response assessment and prediction in longitudinal imaging for brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in 177 patients who were monitored for &gt;360 days at approximately two-month intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12 months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations. Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.</description>

      <title>3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes, though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as 3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden scene.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the ISRGC-Q Challenge, built upon the Image Super-Resolution Generated Content Quality Assessment (ISRGen-QA) dataset, and organized as part of the Visual Quality Assessment (VQualA) Competition at the ICCV 2025 Workshops. Unlike existing Super-Resolution Image Quality Assessment (SR-IQA) datasets, ISRGen-QA places a greater emphasis on SR images generated by the latest generative approaches, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models. The primary goal of this challenge is to analyze the unique artifacts introduced by modern super-resolution techniques and to evaluate their perceptual quality effectively. A total of 108 participants registered for the challenge, with 4 teams submitting valid solutions and fact sheets for the final testing phase. These submissions demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ISRGen-QA dataset. The project is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/ISRGen-QA.</description>

      <title>Index-Preserving Lightweight Token Pruning for Efficient Document Understanding in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Phantom-Insight: Adaptive Multi-cue Fusion for Video Camouflaged Object Detection with Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2) MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently, enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video. Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its strong generalization ability.</description>

      <title>When Language Model Guides Vision: Grounding DINO for Cattle Muzzle Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent, limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network for Image Super-resolution Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work, we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.</description>

      <title>Cross3DReg: Towards a Large-scale Real-world Cross-source Point Cloud Registration Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error (RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$, respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.</description>

      <title>IGAff: Benchmarking Adversarial Iterative and Genetic Affine Algorithms on Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging, especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101 datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack (AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels, and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance, achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with contrasting attention.</description>

      <title>A Statistical 3D Stomach Shape Model for Anatomical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations. We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans, demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab: https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research. This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>Does DINOv3 Set a New Medical Vision Standard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks, can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3 across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization, such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3 does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3 as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>FSG-Net: Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g., illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries. To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations. Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components. Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers. Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.</description>

      <title>WS$^2$: Weakly Supervised Segmentation using Before-After Supervision in Waste Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable. Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials. To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt, including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised segmentation methods on WS$^2$.</description>

      <title>TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KomJay520/TIDE.</description>

      <title>Predicting Brain Tumor Response to Therapy using a Hybrid Deep Learning and Radiomics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks, volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.</description>

      <title>On the Reproducibility of "FairCLIP: Harnessing Fairness in Vision-Language Learning''</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al. (2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset. However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking EfficientTAM on FMO datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</description>

      <title>Back To The Drawing Board: Rethinking Scene-Level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch. Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models, we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches. This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.</description>

      <title>Evolving from Unknown to Known: Retentive Angular Representation Learning for Incremental Open Set Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators for color images.</description>

      <title>CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis, but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across diverse settings.

      <title>Detection of trade in products derived from threatened species using machine learning and a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The application can be used in real time to click images and help identify potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g. in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Swin Attention Networks for Simultaneously Low-Dose PET and CT Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET) have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety. In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet), which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features, while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise. We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</description>

      <title>Investigating Location-Regularised Self-Supervised Feature Learning for Seafloor Visual Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration. Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL, with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs, high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL. Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$ and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Clustering of Seafloor Imagery for Interpretation during Long-Term AUV Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner. The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution, supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3% across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous marine exploration.</description>

      <title>VIM-GS: Visual-Inertial Monocular Gaussian Splatting via Object-level Guidance in Large Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes. Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output, we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.</description>

      <title>BioLite U-Net: Edge-Deployable Semantic Segmentation for In Situ Bioprinting Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process, labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85% and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame, demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines, BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent, closed-loop bioprinting systems.</description>

      <title>STAGE: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis via Graded Diffusion with Explicit Mask Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution, enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA) strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background, resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances downstream anomaly segmentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Cortex Synth, a novel end-to-end differentiable framework for joint 3D skeleton geometry and topology synthesis from single 2D images. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A hierarchical graph attention mechanism with multi-scale skeletal refinement, (2) Differentiable spectral topology optimization via Laplacian eigen decomposition, and (3) Adversarial geometric consistency training for pose structure alignment. The framework integrates four synergistic modules: a pseudo 3D point cloud generator, an enhanced PointNet encoder, a skeleton coordinate decoder, and a novel Differentiable Graph Construction Network (DGCN). Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results with 18.7 percent improvement in MPJPE and 27.3 percent in Graph Edit Distance on ShapeNet, while reducing topological errors by 42 percent compared to previous approaches. The model's end-to-end differentiability enables applications in robotic manipulation, medical imaging, and automated character rigging.</description>

      <title>MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection through an Explainable EfficientNetV2 and MLP-Mixer-Attention Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy and interpretability in brain tumor classification.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot 3D-Aware Trajectory-Guided image-to-video generation via Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets. Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification, which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.</description>

      <title>Co-Seg: Mutual Prompt-Guided Collaborative Learning for Tissue and Nuclei Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances.

      <title>Event Spectroscopy: Event-based Multispectral and Depth Sensing using Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue, which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution, low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to $60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in complex natural environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study. Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we constructed a deep learning feature extraction network ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy, surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89% (890/900) on the expanded test set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption, particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors (ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware, delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw, RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based vision research and early-stage system development.

      <title>D-HUMOR: Dark Humor Understanding via Multimodal Open-ended Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor, target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other), and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model (VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms, producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in multimodal humor understanding and content moderation.

      <title>UrbanTwin: High-Fidelity Synthetic Replicas of Roadside Lidar Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</description>

      <title>P3-SAM: Native 3D Part Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly 3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>SynthDrive: Scalable Real2Sim2Real Sensor Simulation Pipeline for High-Fidelity Asset Generation and Driving Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1) CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2) learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.</description>

      <title>MIORe &amp; VAR-MIORe: Benchmarks to Push the Boundaries of Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.</description>

      <title>UMO: Scaling Multi-Identity Consistency for Image Customization via Matching Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However, since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity preserving.

      <title>Video-Based MPAA Rating Prediction: An Attention-Driven Hybrid Architecture Using Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling, and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application, the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance across streaming platforms.</description>

      <title>Curia: A Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Radiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow, single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models (FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing 150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging. Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Generic Foundation Models for Multimodal Surgical Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition. As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47 different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude increases, highlighting the models susceptibility to adversarial examples. This study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery, they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images, increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric. We are open-sourcing the code, the fine-tuned model weights, as well as the dataset at: https://github.com/MatteoKartoon/BiRefNet.</description>

      <title>Automated Radiographic Total Sharp Score (ARTSS) in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Solution to Reduce Inter-Intra Reader Variation and Enhancing Clinical Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring (ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50, II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed 3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227 validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model, ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits, reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality.</description>

      <title>A New Hybrid Model of Generative Adversarial Network and You Only Look Once Algorithm for Automatic License-Plate Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR) steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%, especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model, particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as input.</description>

      <title>Barlow-Swin: Toward a novel siamese-based segmentation architecture using Swin-Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows, particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks, their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep, computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.</description>

      <title>Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and Inference-Time Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.</description>

      <title>BIR-Adapter: A Low-Complexity Diffusion Model Adapter for Blind Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations. We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity. Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under additional unknown degradations.</description>

      <title>FoMo4Wheat: Toward reliable crop vision foundation models with globally curated data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5 million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites, spanning &gt;2,000 genotypes and &gt;500 environmental conditions). This wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat and https://huggingface.co/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat.

      <title>Interleaving Reasoning for Better Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .</description>

      <title>H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module (TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.</description>

      <title>LocoMamba: Vision-Driven Locomotion via End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning with Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11849v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>ManipDreamer3D : Synthesizing Plausible Robotic Manipulation Video with Occupancy-aware 3D Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory. This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate superior visual quality compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Large Language Models for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Layer-Wise Anomaly Detection in Directed Energy Deposition using High-Fidelity Fringe Projection Profilometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated, annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Feed Two Birds with One Scone: Exploiting Function-Space Regularization for Both OOD Robustness and ID Fine-Tuning Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID) performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this, most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights, features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.</description>

      <title>From Image Generation to Infrastructure Design: a Multi-agent Pipeline for Street Design Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design.</description>

      <title>ProfilingAgent: Profiling-Guided Agentic Reasoning for Adaptive Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies. Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with &lt;0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization.</description>

      <title>Stereovision Image Processing for Planetary Navigation Maps with Semi-Global Matching and Superpixel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes. Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching. State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details. The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue, the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Towards Meta-Cognitive Knowledge Editing for Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing, assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND (Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Tell-Tale Watermarks for Explanatory Reasoning in Synthetic Media Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Detection Through Diverse CNN Architectures in IoT Healthcare Industries: Fast R-CNN, U-Net, Transfer Learning-Based CNN, and Fully Connected CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered deep learning has advanced brain tumor diagnosis in Internet of Things (IoT)-healthcare systems, achieving high accuracy with large datasets. Brain health is critical to human life, and accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides key data for brain tumor detection, serving as a major source of big data for AI-driven image classification. In this study, we classified glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors from MRI images using Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and UNet architectures. We also applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and CNN-based transfer learning models such as Inception-V3, EfficientNetB4, and VGG19. Model performance was assessed using F-score, recall, precision, and accuracy. The Fast R-CNN achieved the best results with 99% accuracy, 98.5% F-score, 99.5% Area Under the Curve (AUC), 99.4% recall, and 98.5% precision. Combining R-CNN, UNet, and transfer learning enables earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment in IoT-healthcare systems, improving patient outcomes. IoT devices such as wearable monitors and smart imaging systems continuously collect real-time data, which AI algorithms analyze to provide immediate insights for timely interventions and personalized care. For external cohort cross-dataset validation, EfficientNetB2 achieved the strongest performance among fine-tuned EfficientNet models, with 92.11% precision, 92.11% recall/sensitivity, 95.96% specificity, 92.02% F1-score, and 92.23% accuracy. These findings underscore the robustness and reliability of AI models in handling diverse datasets, reinforcing their potential to enhance brain tumor classification and patient care in IoT healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Performance of Conformal Prediction in Capturing Aleatoric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.</description>

      <title>eKalibr-Inertial: Continuous-Time Spatiotemporal Calibration for Event-Based Visual-Inertial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</description>

      <title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however the impressive performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.</description>

      <title>Learning in ImaginationLand: Omnidirectional Policies through 3D Generative Models (OP-Gen)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer, and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for data augmentation.</description>

      <title>O$^3$Afford: One-Shot 3D Object-to-Object Affordance Grounding for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints. Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficiency of Latent Spaces via the Coupling-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact, interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality. We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C) can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.</description>

      <title>Signal-Based Malware Classification Using 1D CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These images can then be classified based on their textural information using computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise, caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format. It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of 0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to operate on the proposed signal modality.</description>

      <title>Tackling Device Data Distribution Real-time Shift via Prototype-based Parameter Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based, backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix, facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality.</description>

      <title>Impact of Labeling Inaccuracy and Image Noise on Tooth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs using Federated, Centralized and Local Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI. We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation (additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set. From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at 0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777). Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD: 1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD: 1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Anatomy-Contrast Disentanglement: A Domain-General MRI Harmonization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an invaluable tool for clinical and research applications. Yet, variations in scanners and acquisition parameters cause inconsistencies in image contrast, hindering data comparability and reproducibility across datasets and clinical studies. Existing scanner harmonization methods, designed to address this challenge, face limitations, such as requiring traveling subjects or struggling to generalize to unseen domains. We propose a novel approach using a conditioned diffusion autoencoder with a contrastive loss and domain-agnostic contrast augmentation to harmonize MR images across scanners while preserving subject-specific anatomy. Our method enables brain MRI synthesis from a single reference image. It outperforms baseline techniques, achieving a +7% PSNR improvement on a traveling subjects dataset and +18% improvement on age regression in unseen. Our model provides robust, effective harmonization of brain MRIs to target scanners without requiring fine-tuning. This advancement promises to enhance comparability, reproducibility, and generalizability in multi-site and longitudinal clinical studies, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>From Skin to Skeleton: Towards Biomechanically Accurate 3D Digital Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code, and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..</description>

      <title>Towards In-Air Ultrasonic QR Codes: Deep Learning for Classification of Passive Reflector Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable alternative for autonomous systems. While previous research has successfully classified individual acoustic landmarks, this paper takes a step towards increasing information capacity by introducing reflector constellations as encoded tags. Our primary contribution is a multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to simultaneously identify multiple, closely spaced reflectors from a single in-air 3D sonar measurement. Our initial findings on a small dataset confirm the feasibility of this approach, validating the ability to decode these complex acoustic patterns. Secondly, we investigated using adaptive beamforming with null-steering to isolate individual reflectors for single-label classification. Finally, we discuss the experimental results and limitations, offering key insights and future directions for developing acoustic landmark systems with significantly increased information entropy and their accurate and robust detection and classification.</description>

      <title>MM-DINOv2: Adapting Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited annotations.</description>

      <title>LLaDA-VLA: Vision Language Diffusion Action Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.</description>

      <title>Scaling Transformer-Based Novel View Synthesis Models with Token Disentanglement and Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data. As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

      <title>F1: A Vision-Language-Action Model Bridging Understanding and Generation to Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation, and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Deep Reactive Policy: Learning Reactive Manipulator Motion Planning for Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization, outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: 3D skeleton-based human action recognition has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional RGB and depth-based approaches, offering robustness to environmental variations, computational efficiency, and enhanced privacy. Despite remarkable progress, current research remains fragmented across diverse input representations and lacks evaluation under scenarios that reflect modern real-world challenges.This paper presents a representation-centric survey of skeleton-based action recognition, systematically categorizing state-of-the-art methods by their input feature types: joint coordinates, bone vectors, motion flows, and extended representations, and analyzing how these choices influence spatial-temporal modeling strategies. Building on the insights from this review, we introduce ANUBIS, a large-scale, challenging skeleton action dataset designed to address critical gaps in existing benchmarks. ANUBIS incorporates multi-view recordings with back-view perspectives, complex multi-person interactions, fine-grained and violent actions, and contemporary social behaviors.We benchmark a diverse set of state-of-the-art models on ANUBIS and conduct an in-depth analysis of how different feature types affect recognition performance across 102 action categories. Our results show strong action-feature dependencies, highlight the limitations of na\"ive multi-representational fusion, and point toward the need for task-aware, semantically aligned integration strategies. This work offers both a comprehensive foundation and a practical benchmarking resource, aiming to guide the next generation of robust, generalizable skeleton-based action recognition systems for complex real-world scenarios.The dataset website, benchmarking framework, and download link are available at https://yliu1082.github.io/ANUBIS/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, ascertaining whether an agent is human is critical. We systematically benchmark AI's ability to imitate humans in three language tasks (image captioning, word association, conversation) and three vision tasks (color estimation, object detection, attention prediction), collecting data from 636 humans and 37 AI agents. Next, we conducted 72,191 Turing-like tests with 1,916 human judges and 10 AI judges. Current AIs are approaching the ability to convincingly impersonate humans and deceive human judges in both language and vision. Even simple AI judges outperformed humans in distinguishing AI from human responses. Imitation ability showed minimal correlation with conventional AI performance metrics, suggesting that passing as human is an important independent evaluation criterion. The large-scale Turing datasets and metrics introduced here offer valuable benchmarks for assessing human-likeness in AI and highlight the importance of rigorous, quantitative imitation tests for AI development.</description>

      <title>ADIR: Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in image generation, capturing rich information about natural image statistics. This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model. We evaluate our approach on two leading publicly available diffusion models--Stable Diffusion and Guided Diffusion--and demonstrate that our method, termed Adaptive Diffusion for Image Reconstruction (ADIR), yields substantial improvements across a range of image reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential for deploying autonomous systems can be significantly increased by improving the perception and interpretation of the environment. However, the development of deep learning-based techniques for autonomous systems in unstructured outdoor environments poses challenges due to limited data availability for training and testing. To address this gap, we present the German Outdoor and Offroad Dataset (GOOSE), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for unstructured outdoor environments. The GOOSE dataset incorporates 10 000 labeled pairs of images and point clouds, which are utilized to train a range of state-of-the-art segmentation models on both image and point cloud data. We open source the dataset, along with an ontology for unstructured terrain, as well as dataset standards and guidelines. This initiative aims to establish a common framework, enabling the seamless inclusion of existing datasets and a fast way to enhance the perception capabilities of various robots operating in unstructured environments. The dataset, pre-trained models for offroad perception, and additional documentation can be found at https://goose-dataset.de/.</description>

      <title>EdgeSAM: Prompt-In-the-Loop Distillation for SAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents EdgeSAM, an accelerated variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), optimized for efficient execution on edge devices with minimal compromise in performance. Our approach involves distilling the original ViT-based SAM image encoder into a purely CNN-based architecture, better suited for edge devices. We carefully benchmark various distillation strategies and demonstrate that task-agnostic encoder distillation fails to capture the full knowledge embodied in SAM. To overcome this bottleneck, we include both the prompt encoder and mask decoder in the distillation process, with box and point prompts in the loop, so that the distilled model can accurately capture the intricate dynamics between user input and mask generation. To mitigate dataset bias issues stemming from point prompt distillation, we incorporate a lightweight module within the encoder. As a result, EdgeSAM achieves a 37-fold speed increase compared to the original SAM, and it also outperforms MobileSAM/EfficientSAM, being over 7 times as fast when deployed on edge devices while enhancing the mIoUs on COCO and LVIS by 2.3/1.5 and 3.1/1.6, respectively. It is also the first SAM variant that can run at over 30 FPS on an iPhone 14. Code and demo are available at https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/edgesam.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on species distribution modeling using global-scale presence-only data, leveraging geographical and environmental features to map species ranges, as in previous studies. However, we innovate by integrating taxonomic classification into our approach. Specifically, we propose using a large language model to extract a latent representation of the taxonomic classification from a textual prompt. This allows us to map the range of any taxonomic rank, including unseen species, without additional supervision. We also present a new proximity-aware evaluation metric, suitable for evaluating species distribution models, which addresses critical shortcomings of traditional metrics. We evaluated our model for species range prediction, zero-shot prediction, and geo-feature regression and found that it outperforms several state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Osprey: Pixel Understanding with Visual Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10032v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved impressive general-purpose vision-language capabilities through visual instruction tuning. However, current MLLMs primarily focus on image-level or box-level understanding, falling short in achieving fine-grained vision-language alignment at pixel level. Besides, the lack of mask-based instruction data limits their advancements. In this paper, we propose Osprey, a mask-text instruction tuning approach, to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction, aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal, we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples, and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Specifically, Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input. Experimental results demonstrate Osprey's superiority in various region understanding tasks, showcasing its new capability for pixel-level instruction tuning. In particular, Osprey can be integrated with Segment Anything Model (SAM) seamlessly to obtain multi-granularity semantics. The source code, dataset and demo can be found at https://github.com/CircleRadon/Osprey.</description>

      <title>Regeneration Based Training-free Attribution of Fake Images Generated by Text-to-Image Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have recently garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate images based on prompt descriptions. While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.</description>

      <title>Slice-100K: A Multimodal Dataset for Extrusion-based 3D Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G-code (Geometric code) or RS-274 is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. G-code provides machine instructions for the movement of the 3D printer, especially for the nozzle, stage, and extrusion of material for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Currently, there does not exist a large repository of curated CAD models along with their corresponding G-code files for additive manufacturing. To address this issue, we present Slice-100K, a first-of-its-kind dataset of over 100,000 G-code files, along with their tessellated CAD model, LVIS (Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation) categories, geometric properties, and renderings. We build our dataset from triangulated meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by finetuning GPT-2 on a subset of the dataset for G-code translation from a legacy G-code format (Sailfish) to a more modern, widely used format (Marlin). Our dataset can be found at https://github.com/idealab-isu/Slice-100K. Slice-100K will be the first step in developing a multimodal foundation model for digital manufacturing.</description>

      <title>ShapeSplat: A Large-scale Dataset of Gaussian Splats and Their Self-Supervised Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build ShapeSplat, a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet, ModelNet and Objaverse datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 206K objects spanning over 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 3.8 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.
  We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce Gaussian-MAE, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Evidential Transformer, an uncertainty-driven transformer model for improved and robust image retrieval. In this paper, we make several contributions to content-based image retrieval (CBIR). We incorporate probabilistic methods into image retrieval, achieving robust and reliable results, with evidential classification surpassing traditional training based on multiclass classification as a baseline for deep metric learning. Furthermore, we improve the state-of-the-art retrieval results on several datasets by leveraging the Global Context Vision Transformer (GC ViT) architecture. Our experimental results consistently demonstrate the reliability of our approach, setting a new benchmark in CBIR in all test settings on the Stanford Online Products (SOP) and CUB-200-2011 datasets.</description>

      <title>ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</description>

Abstract: Planning with partial observation is a central challenge in embodied AI. A majority of prior works have tackled this challenge by developing agents that physically explore their environment to update their beliefs about the world state. In contrast, humans can $\textit{imagine}$ unseen parts of the world through a mental exploration and $\textit{revise}$ their beliefs with imagined observations. Such updated beliefs can allow them to make more informed decisions, without necessitating the physical exploration of the world at all times. To achieve this human-like ability, we introduce the $\textit{Generative World Explorer (Genex)}$, an egocentric world exploration framework that allows an agent to mentally explore a large-scale 3D world (e.g., urban scenes) and acquire imagined observations to update its belief. This updated belief will then help the agent to make a more informed decision at the current step. To train $\textit{Genex}$, we create a synthetic urban scene dataset, Genex-DB. Our experimental results demonstrate that (1) $\textit{Genex}$ can generate high-quality and consistent observations during long-horizon exploration of a large virtual physical world and (2) the beliefs updated with the generated observations can inform an existing decision-making model (e.g., an LLM agent) to make better plans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual Question Generation (VQG) research focuses predominantly on natural images while neglecting the diagram, which is a critical component in educational materials. To meet the needs of pedagogical assessment, we propose the Diagram-Driven Course Questions Generation (DDCQG) task and construct DiagramQG, a comprehensive dataset with 15,720 diagrams and 25,798 questions across 37 subjects and 371 courses. Our approach employs course and input text constraints to generate course-relevant questions about specific diagram elements. We reveal three challenges of DDCQG: domain-specific knowledge requirements across courses, long-tail distribution in course coverage, and high information density in diagrams. To address these, we propose the Hierarchical Knowledge Integration framework (HKI-DDCQG), which utilizes trainable CLIP for identifying relevant diagram patches, leverages frozen vision-language models for knowledge extraction, and generates questions with trainable T5. Experiments demonstrate that HKI-DDCQG outperforms existing models on DiagramQG while maintaining strong generalizability across natural image datasets, establishing a strong baseline for DDCQG.</description>

      <title>ElectroVizQA: How well do Multi-modal LLMs perform in Electronics Visual Question Answering?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining significant attention for their ability to process multi-modal data, providing enhanced contextual understanding of complex problems. MLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA); however, they often struggle with fundamental engineering problems, and there is a scarcity of specialized datasets for training on topics like digital electronics. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark dataset called ElectroVizQA specifically designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance on digital electronic circuit problems commonly found in undergraduate curricula. This dataset, the first of its kind tailored for the VQA task in digital electronics, comprises approximately 626 visual questions, offering a comprehensive overview of digital electronics topics. This paper rigorously assesses the extent to which MLLMs can understand and solve digital electronic circuit questions, providing insights into their capabilities and limitations within this specialized domain. By introducing this benchmark dataset, we aim to motivate further research and development in the application of MLLMs to engineering education, ultimately bridging the performance gap and enhancing the efficacy of these models in technical fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved outstanding results in the field of image super-resolution. These methods typically inject low-resolution (LR) images via ControlNet.In this paper, we first explore the temporal dynamics of information infusion through ControlNet, revealing that the input from LR images predominantly influences the initial stages of the denoising process. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel timestep-aware diffusion model that adaptively integrates features from both ControlNet and the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD). Our method enhances the transmission of LR information in the early stages of diffusion to guarantee image fidelity and stimulates the generation ability of the SD model itself more in the later stages to enhance the detail of generated images. To train this method, we propose a timestep-aware training strategy that adopts distinct losses at varying timesteps and acts on disparate modules. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code: https://github.com/SleepyLin/TASR</description>

      <title>NF3DM: Combining Neural Fields and Deformation Models for 3D Non-Rigid Motion Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel, data-driven approach for reconstructing temporally coherent 3D motion from unstructured and potentially partial observations of non-rigidly deforming shapes. Our goal is to achieve high-fidelity motion reconstructions for shapes that undergo near-isometric deformations, such as humans wearing loose clothing. The key novelty of our work lies in its ability to combine implicit shape representations with explicit mesh-based deformation models, enabling detailed and temporally coherent motion reconstructions without relying on parametric shape models or decoupling shape and motion. Each frame is represented as a neural field decoded from a feature space where observations over time are fused, hence preserving geometric details present in the input data. Temporal coherence is enforced with a near-isometric deformation constraint between adjacent frames that applies to the underlying surface in the neural field. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, as demonstrated by its application to human and animal motion sequences reconstructed from monocular depth videos.</description>

      <title>Llama Learns to Direct: DirectorLLM for Human-Centric Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DirectorLLM, a novel video generation model that employs a large language model (LLM) to orchestrate human poses within videos. As foundational text-to-video models rapidly evolve, the demand for high-quality human motion and interaction grows. To address this need and enhance the authenticity of human motions, we extend the LLM from a text generator to a video director and human motion simulator. Utilizing open-source resources from Llama 3, we train the DirectorLLM to generate detailed instructional signals, such as human poses, to guide video generation. This approach offloads the simulation of human motion from the video generator to the LLM, effectively creating informative outlines for human-centric scenes. These signals are used as conditions by the video renderer, facilitating more realistic and prompt-following video generation. As an independent LLM module, it can be applied to different video renderers, including UNet and DiT, with minimal effort. Experiments on automatic evaluation benchmarks and human evaluations show that our model outperforms existing ones in generating videos with higher human motion fidelity, improved prompt faithfulness, and enhanced rendered subject naturalness.</description>

      <title>Motion-enhanced Cardiac Anatomy Segmentation via an Insertable Temporal Attention Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac anatomy segmentation is useful for clinical assessment of cardiac morphology to inform diagnosis and intervention. Deep learning (DL), especially with motion information, has improved segmentation accuracy. However, existing techniques for motion enhancement are not yet optimal, and they have high computational costs due to increased dimensionality or reduced robustness due to suboptimal approaches that use non-DL motion registration, non-attention models, or single-headed attention. They further have limited adaptability and are inconvenient for incorporation into existing networks where motion awareness is desired. Here, we propose a novel, computationally efficient Temporal Attention Module (TAM) that offers robust motion enhancement, modeled as a small, multi-headed, cross-temporal attention module. TAM's uniqueness is that it is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be inserted into a broad range of segmentation networks (CNN-based, Transformer-based, or hybrid) for motion enhancement without requiring substantial changes in the network's backbone. This feature enables high adaptability and ease of integration for enhancing both existing and future networks. Extensive experiments on multiple 2D and 3D cardiac ultrasound and MRI datasets confirm that TAM consistently improves segmentation across a range of networks while maintaining computational efficiency and improving on currently reported performance. The evidence demonstrates that it is a robust, generalizable solution for motion-awareness enhancement that is scalable (such as from 2D to 3D).</description>

      <title>Separate Motion from Appearance: Customizing Motion via Customizing Text-to-Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion customization aims to adapt the diffusion model (DM) to generate videos with the motion specified by a set of video clips with the same motion concept. To realize this goal, the adaptation of DM should be possible to model the specified motion concept, without compromising the ability to generate diverse appearances. Thus, the key to solving this problem lies in how to separate the motion concept from the appearance in the adaptation process of DM. Typical previous works explore different ways to represent and insert a motion concept into large-scale pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, e.g., learning a motion LoRA, using latent noise residuals, etc. While those methods can encode the motion concept, they also inevitably encode the appearance in the reference videos, resulting in weakened appearance generation capability. In this paper, we follow the typical way to learn a motion LoRA to encode the motion concept, but propose two novel strategies to enhance motion-appearance separation, including temporal attention purification (TAP) and appearance highway (AH). Specifically, we assume that in the temporal attention module, the pretrained Value embeddings are sufficient to serve as basic components needed by producing a new motion. Thus, in TAP, we choose only to reshape the temporal attention with motion LoRAs so that Value embeddings can be reorganized to produce a new motion. Further, in AH, we alter the starting point of each skip connection in U-Net from the output of each temporal attention module to the output of each spatial attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to previous works, our method can generate videos with appearance more aligned with the text descriptions and motion more consistent with the reference videos.</description>

      <title>FAAGC: Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve Based on the shape space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely applied across various domains and industries. However, many fields still face challenges due to limited and insufficient data. This paper proposes a Feature Augmentation on Adaptive Geodesic Curve (FAAGC) method in the pre-shape space to increase data. In the pre-shape space, objects with identical shapes lie on a great circle. Thus, we project deep model representations into the pre-shape space and construct a geodesic curve, i.e., an arc of a great circle, for each class. Feature augmentation is then performed by sampling along these geodesic paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAAGC improves classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and generalizes well across various feature types.</description>

      <title>CHIRLA: Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a key challenge in computer vision, requiring the matching of individuals across cameras, locations, and time. While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust systems that handle long-term variations caused by clothing and physical changes. We present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset designed for video-based long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA was recorded over seven months in four connected indoor environments using seven strategically placed cameras, capturing realistic movements with substantial clothing and appearance variability. The dataset includes 22 individuals, more than five hours of video, and about 1M bounding boxes with identity annotations obtained through semi-automatic labeling. We also define benchmark protocols for person tracking and Re-ID, covering diverse and challenging scenarios such as occlusion, reappearance, and multi-camera conditions. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios. The benchmark code is publicly available at: https://github.com/bdager/CHIRLA.</description>

      <title>AI Sees Your Location, But With A Bias Toward The Wealthy World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, particularly in recognizing geographic information from images. However, VLMs still show regional biases in this task. To systematically evaluate these issues, we introduce a benchmark consisting of 1,200 images paired with detailed geographic metadata. Evaluating four VLMs, we find that while these models demonstrate the ability to recognize geographic information from images, achieving up to 53.8% accuracy in city prediction, they exhibit significant biases. Specifically, performance is substantially higher for economically developed and densely populated regions compared to less developed (-12.5%) and sparsely populated (-17.0%) areas. Moreover, regional biases of frequently over-predicting certain locations remain. For instance, they consistently predict Sydney for images taken in Australia, shown by the low entropy scores for these countries. The strong performance of VLMs also raises privacy concerns, particularly for users who share images online without the intent of being identified. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/FairLocator.</description>

      <title>In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy: Efficient Estimation of Segmentation Quality without Ground-Truth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. In this paper, we introduce In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy (In-Context RCA), a novel framework for automatically estimating segmentation quality in the absence of ground-truth annotations. By leveraging recent in-context learning segmentation models and incorporating retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images, our approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data. Validated across diverse medical imaging modalities, our method demonstrates robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

      <title>GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05689v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

      <title>StreamMind: Unlocking Full Frame Rate Streaming Video Dialogue through Event-Gated Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of real-world human-AI interaction applications, such as AI assistants, the need for Streaming Video Dialogue is critical. To address this need, we introduce StreamMind, a video LLM framework that achieves ultra-FPS streaming video processing (100 fps on a single A100) and enables proactive, always-on responses in real time, without explicit user intervention.
  To solve the key challenge of the contradiction between linear video streaming speed and quadratic transformer computation cost, we propose a novel perception-cognition interleaving paradigm named ''event-gated LLM invocation'', in contrast to the existing per-time-step LLM invocation. By introducing a Cognition Gate network between the video encoder and the LLM, LLM is only invoked when relevant events occur. To realize the event feature extraction with constant cost, we propose Event-Preserving Feature Extractor (EPFE) based on state-space method, generating a single perception token for spatiotemporal features. These techniques enable the video LLM with full-FPS perception and real-time cognition response.
  Experiments on Ego4D and SoccerNet streaming tasks, as well as standard offline benchmarks, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both model capability and real-time efficiency, paving the way for ultra-high-FPS applications, such as Game AI and interactive media. The code and data is available at https://aka.ms/StreamMind.</description>

      <title>VisBias: Measuring Explicit and Implicit Social Biases in Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates both explicit and implicit social biases exhibited by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The key distinction between these bias types lies in the level of awareness: explicit bias refers to conscious, intentional biases, while implicit bias operates subconsciously. To analyze explicit bias, we directly pose questions to VLMs related to gender and racial differences: (1) Multiple-choice questions based on a given image (e.g., "What is the education level of the person in the image?") (2) Yes-No comparisons using two images (e.g., "Is the person in the first image more educated than the person in the second image?") For implicit bias, we design tasks where VLMs assist users but reveal biases through their responses: (1) Image description tasks: Models are asked to describe individuals in images, and we analyze disparities in textual cues across demographic groups. (2) Form completion tasks: Models draft a personal information collection form with 20 attributes, and we examine correlations among selected attributes for potential biases. We evaluate Gemini-1.5, GPT-4V, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.2-Vision and LLaVA-v1.6. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/uscnlp-lime/VisBias.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of modern machine learning, particularly in facial translation networks, is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, paired, large-scale datasets. However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks Can (Meta-)Learn the Same-Different Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have come to match and exceed human performance in many settings, the tasks these models optimize for are largely constrained to the level of individual objects, such as classification and captioning. Humans remain vastly superior to CNNs in visual tasks involving relations, including the ability to identify two objects as `same' or `different'. A number of studies have shown that while CNNs can be coaxed into learning the same-different relation in some settings, they tend to generalize poorly to other instances of this relation. In this work we show that the same CNN architectures that fail to generalize the same-different relation with conventional training are able to succeed when trained via meta-learning, which explicitly encourages abstraction and generalization across tasks.</description>

      <title>IMAGGarment: Fine-Grained Garment Generation for Controllable Fashion Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents IMAGGarment, a fine-grained garment generation (FGG) framework that enables high-fidelity garment synthesis with precise control over silhouette, color, and logo placement. Unlike existing methods that are limited to single-condition inputs, IMAGGarment addresses the challenges of multi-conditional controllability in personalized fashion design and digital apparel applications. Specifically, IMAGGarment employs a two-stage training strategy to separately model global appearance and local details, while enabling unified and controllable generation through end-to-end inference. In the first stage, we propose a global appearance model that jointly encodes silhouette and color using a mixed attention module and a color adapter. In the second stage, we present a local enhancement model with an adaptive appearance-aware module to inject user-defined logos and spatial constraints, enabling accurate placement and visual consistency. To support this task, we release GarmentBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 180K garment samples paired with multi-level design conditions, including sketches, color references, logo placements, and textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior structural stability, color fidelity, and local controllability performance. Code, models, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGGarment.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: A Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. The U-Net is compared with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>

      <title>WMKA-Net: A Weighted Multi-Kernel Attention Network for Retinal Vessel Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is crucial for intelligent ophthalmic diagnosis, yet it faces three major challenges: insufficient multi-scale feature fusion, disruption of contextual continuity, and noise interference. This study proposes a dual-stage solution to address these issues. The first stage employs a Reversible Multi-Scale Fusion Module (RMS) that uses hierarchical adaptive convolution to dynamically merge cross-scale features from capillaries to main vessels, self-adaptively calibrating feature biases. The second stage introduces a Vascular-Oriented Attention Mechanism, which models long-distance vascular continuity through an axial pathway and enhances the capture of topological key nodes, such as bifurcation points, via a dedicated bifurcation attention pathway. The synergistic operation of these two pathways effectively restores the continuity of vascular structures and improves the segmentation accuracy of complex vascular networks. Systematic experiments on the DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE-DB1 datasets demonstrate that WMKA-Net achieves an accuracy of 0.9909, sensitivity of 0.9198, and specificity of 0.9953, significantly outperforming existing methods. This model provides an efficient, precise, and robust intelligent solution for the early screening of diabetic retinopathy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Partially Relevant Video Retrieval through Inter- and Intra-Sample Analysis with Coherence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve the target video that is partially relevant to the text query. The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, which enhances temporal structure learning by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video frames and moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <title>Corner Cases: How Size and Position of Objects Challenge ImageNet-Trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backgrounds in images play a major role in contributing to spurious correlations among different data points. Owing to aesthetic preferences of humans capturing the images, datasets can exhibit positional (location of the object within a given frame) and size (region-of-interest to image ratio) biases for different classes. In this paper, we show that these biases can impact how much a model relies on spurious features in the background to make its predictions. To better illustrate our findings, we propose a synthetic dataset derived from ImageNet-1k, Hard-Spurious-ImageNet, which contains images with various backgrounds, object positions, and object sizes. By evaluating the dataset on different pretrained models, we find that most models rely heavily on spurious features in the background when the region-of-interest (ROI) to image ratio is small and the object is far from the center of the image. Moreover, we also show that current methods that aim to mitigate harmful spurious features, do not take into account these factors, hence fail to achieve considerable performance gains for worst-group accuracies when the size and location of core features in an image change.

      <title>HumaniBench: A Human-Centric Framework for Large Multimodal Models Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11454v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have been widely tested on tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounding, but lack rigorous evaluation for alignment with human-centered (HC) values such as fairness, ethics, and inclusivity. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{HumaniBench}, a novel benchmark of 32,000 real-world image-question pairs and an evaluation suite. Labels are generated via an AI-assisted pipeline and validated by experts. HumaniBench assesses LMMs across seven key alignment principles: fairness, ethics, empathy, inclusivity, reasoning, robustness, and multilinguality, through diverse open-ended and closed-ended VQA tasks. Grounded in AI ethics and real-world needs, these principles provide a holistic lens for societal impact. Benchmarking results on different LMM shows that proprietary models generally lead in reasoning, fairness, and multilinguality, while open-source models excel in robustness and grounding. Most models struggle to balance accuracy with ethical and inclusive behavior. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and test-time scaling improve alignment. As the first benchmark tailored for HC alignment, HumaniBench offers a rigorous testbed to diagnose limitations, and promote responsible LMM development. All data and code are publicly available for reproducibility.

      <title>Making Rotation Averaging Fast and Robust with Anisotropic Coordinate Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation, uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page: https://ylochman.github.io/acd</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with computer vision is profoundly transforming perception tasks like image segmentation. For intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where accurate scene understanding is critical for safety and efficiency, this new paradigm offers unprecedented capabilities. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of LLM-augmented image segmentation, focusing on its applications, challenges, and future directions within ITS. We provide a taxonomy of current approaches based on their prompting mechanisms and core architectures, and we highlight how these innovations can enhance road scene understanding for autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance. Finally, we identify key challenges, including real-time performance and safety-critical reliability, and outline a perspective centered on explainable, human-centric AI as a prerequisite for the successful deployment of this technology in next-generation transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Pushing Trade-Off Boundaries: Compact yet Effective Remote Sensing Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is essential for monitoring urban expansion, disaster assessment, and resource management, offering timely, accurate, and large-scale insights into dynamic landscape transformations. While deep learning has revolutionized change detection, the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern models have not necessarily translated into significant accuracy gains. Instead of following this trend, this study explores a more efficient approach, focusing on lightweight models that maintain high accuracy while minimizing resource consumption, which is an essential requirement for on-satellite processing. To this end, we propose FlickCD, which means quick flick then get great results, pushing the boundaries of the performance-resource trade-off. FlickCD introduces an Enhanced Difference Module (EDM) to amplify critical feature differences between temporal phases while suppressing irrelevant variations such as lighting and weather changes, thereby reducing computational costs in the subsequent change decoder. Additionally, the FlickCD decoder incorporates Local-Global Fusion Blocks, leveraging Shifted Window Self-Attention (SWSA) and Efficient Global Self-Attention (EGSA) to effectively capture semantic information at multiple scales, preserving both coarse- and fine-grained changes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that FlickCD reduces computational and storage overheads by more than an order of magnitude while achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance or incurring only a minor (&lt;1% F1) accuracy trade-off. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/xulsh8/FlickCD.</description>

      <title>Visual Structures Helps Visual Reasoning: Addressing the Binding Problem in VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual reasoning is often limited by the binding problem: the failure to reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents. This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces VISER (Visual Input Structure for Enhanced Reasoning), a simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level spatial structures and pairing this with a textual prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning tasks. Specifically, VISER improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by 25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship tasks by 9.50% on a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies, including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade performance. VISER enhances binding only with a single-query inference, underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.</description>

      <title>CoreMark: Toward Robust and Universal Text Watermarking Technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text watermarking schemes have gained considerable attention in recent years, yet still face critical challenges in achieving simultaneous robustness, generalizability, and imperceptibility. This paper introduces a new embedding paradigm,termed CORE, which comprises several consecutively aligned black pixel segments. Its key innovation lies in its inherent noise resistance during transmission and broad applicability across languages and fonts. Based on the CORE, we present a text watermarking framework named CoreMark. Specifically, CoreMark first dynamically extracts COREs from characters. Then, the characters with stronger robustness are selected according to the lengths of COREs. By modifying the thickness of the CORE, the hidden data is embedded into the selected characters without causing significant visual distortions. Moreover, a general plug-and-play embedding strength modulator is proposed, which can adaptively enhance the robustness for small font sizes by adjusting the embedding strength according to the font size. Experimental evaluation indicates that CoreMark demonstrates outstanding generalizability across multiple languages and fonts. Compared to existing methods, CoreMark achieves significant improvements in resisting screenshot, print-scan, and print camera attacks, while maintaining satisfactory imperceptibility.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Out-of-Distribution Unlabeled Images: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with an Open-Vocabulary Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images) or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution (OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and (2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU, respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes abundant unlabeled OOD images for semantic segmentation tasks. We hope this work can inspire future research and real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/wooseok-shin/SemiOVS</description>

      <title>Driver-Net: Multi-Camera Fusion for Assessing Driver Take-Over Readiness in Automated Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safe transition of control in automated vehicles requires an accurate and timely assessment of driver readiness. This paper introduces Driver-Net, a novel deep learning framework that fuses multi-camera inputs to estimate driver take-over readiness. Unlike conventional vision-based driver monitoring systems that focus on head pose or eye gaze, Driver-Net captures synchronised visual cues from the driver's head, hands, and body posture through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block, followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion. As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with new regulatory mandates and upcoming safety standards.</description>

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.</description>

      <title>DiffOSeg: Omni Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Expert Collaboration Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

      <title>Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</description>

      <title>LMM4Edit: Benchmarking and Evaluating Multimodal Image Editing with LMMs</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4Edit.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Continuous Colormap Recovery from a 2D Scalar Field Visualization without a Legend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications -- colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color palettes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Image Similarity Metric for Scene Composition Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc. Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal, neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM), a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely, it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of scene composition.

      <title>SGDFuse: SAM-Guided Diffusion for High-Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks. However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at https://github.com/boshizhang123/SGDFuse.</description>

      <title>VSI: Visual Subtitle Integration for Keyframe Selection to enhance Long Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream, respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00% key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed multimodal search strategy.</description>

      <title>Physical Autoregressive Model for Robotic Manipulation without Action Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector for Image Forgery Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization. While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space, generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2) Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by them.</description>

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However, due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various robot tasks.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

      <title>AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem: optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time. Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally, AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.</description>

      <title>What Can We Learn from Harry Potter? An Exploratory Study of Visual Representation Learning from Atypical Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the open world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing studies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets, open-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are interested in asking: What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in the learning process? To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting of various types of unusual atypical data (e.g., sci-fi, animation, etc.). To study how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into the model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key tasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel category discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found that even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently improve performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that increasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD detection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more semantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance compared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the semantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to unseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental evaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation learning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset, encouraging further studies in this direction.

      <title>MESTI-MEGANet: Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image and Micro-expression Gradient Attention Networks for Micro-expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements. Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network (MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI, comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures (VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>ER-LoRA: Effective-Rank Guided Adaptation for Weather-Generalized Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog, snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data. Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to achieve weather-generalized depth estimation by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of high-visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry -- centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM) strategy, which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of effective ranks (entropy-rank and stable-rank). In the tuning phase, we adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task-aware singular directions for initialization, based on the entropy-rank and full-tuned weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization based on the stable-rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and full fine-tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Image-to-Brain Signal Generation with Cross-Attention Mechanisms for Visual Prostheses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind individuals. However, while researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process-converting images to M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage-remains largely unexplored. Thus, we present the first image-to-brain signal (M/EEG) framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained alignment during the generation process. Furthermore, we evaluate our framework on two multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Additionally, we pioneer the visualization of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PractiLight: Practical Light Control Using Foundational Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach, effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge, enabling practical and general relighting.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of mPLUG-Owl2 via Pixel-Level Visual Prompts for NR-IQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (&lt; 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks.

      <title>NoisyNN: Exploring the Impact of Information Entropy Change in Learning Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of entropy change in deep learning systems by noise injection at different levels, including the embedding space and the image. The series of models that employ our methodology are collectively known as Noisy Neural Networks (NoisyNN), with examples such as NoisyViT and NoisyCNN. Noise is conventionally viewed as a harmful perturbation in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), as well as different learning tasks like image classification and transfer learning. However, this work shows noise can be an effective way to change the entropy of the learning system. We demonstrate that specific noise can boost the performance of various deep models under certain conditions. We theoretically prove the enhancement gained from positive noise by reducing the task complexity defined by information entropy and experimentally show the significant performance gain in large image datasets, such as the ImageNet. Herein, we use the information entropy to define the complexity of the task. We categorize the noise into two types, positive noise (PN) and harmful noise (HN), based on whether the noise can help reduce the task complexity. Extensive experiments of CNNs and ViTs have shown performance improvements by proactively injecting positive noise, where we achieved an unprecedented top 1 accuracy of 95$\%$ on ImageNet. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence have confirmed that the presence of positive noise, can benefit the learning process, while the traditionally perceived harmful noise indeed impairs deep learning models. The different roles of noise offer new explanations for deep models on specific tasks and provide a new paradigm for improving model performance. Moreover, it reminds us that we can influence the performance of learning systems via information entropy change.</description>

      <title>Support or Refute: Analyzing the Stance of Evidence to Detect Out-of-Context Mis- and Disinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01766v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mis- and disinformation online have become a major societal problem as major sources of online harms of different kinds. One common form of mis- and disinformation is out-of-context (OOC) information, where different pieces of information are falsely associated, e.g., a real image combined with a false textual caption or a misleading textual description. Although some past studies have attempted to defend against OOC mis- and disinformation through external evidence, they tend to disregard the role of different pieces of evidence with different stances. Motivated by the intuition that the stance of evidence represents a bias towards different detection results, we propose a stance extraction network (SEN) that can extract the stances of different pieces of multi-modal evidence in a unified framework. Moreover, we introduce a support-refutation score calculated based on the co-occurrence relations of named entities into the textual SEN. Extensive experiments on a public large-scale dataset demonstrated that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, with the best model achieving a performance gain of 3.2% in accuracy. The source code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/yx3266/SEN.</description>

      <title>AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model. Demos are shown in https://junzhan2000.github.io/AnyGPT.github.io/</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Data Augmentation for Cardiac MRI using Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While deep learning holds great promise for disease diagnosis and prognosis in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, its progress is often constrained by highly imbalanced and biased training datasets. To address this issue, we propose a method to alleviate imbalances inherent in datasets through the generation of synthetic data based on sensitive attributes such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and health condition. We adopt ControlNet based on a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to condition on text assembled from patient metadata and cardiac geometry derived from segmentation masks. We assess our method using a large-cohort study from the UK Biobank by evaluating the realism of the generated images using established quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we conduct a downstream classification task aimed at debiasing a classifier by rectifying imbalances within underrepresented groups through synthetically generated samples. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating dataset imbalances, such as the scarcity of diagnosed female patients or individuals with normal BMI level suffering from heart failure. This work represents a major step towards the adoption of synthetic data for the development of fair and generalizable models for medical classification tasks. Notably, we conduct all our experiments using a single, consumer-level GPU to highlight the feasibility of our approach within resource-constrained environments. Our code is available at https://github.com/faildeny/debiasing-cardiac-mri.</description>

Abstract: Objectives: To present a publicly available deep learning-based torso segmentation model that provides comprehensive voxel-wise coverage, including delineations that extend to the boundaries of anatomical compartments. Materials and Methods: We extracted preliminary segmentations from TotalSegmentator, spine, and body composition models for Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MR) images, then improved them iteratively and retrained an nnUNet model. Using a random retrospective subset of German National Cohort (NAKO), UK Biobank, internal MR and Computed Tomography (CT) data (Training: 2897 series from 626 subjects, 290 female; mean age 53+-16; 3-fold-cross validation (20% hold-out). Internal testing 36 series from 12 subjects, 6 male; mean age 60+-11), we segmented 71 structures in torso MR and 72 in CT images: 20 organs, 10 muscles, 19 vessels, 16 bones, ribs in CT, intervertebral discs, spinal cord, spinal canal and body composition (subcutaneous fat, unclassified muscles and visceral fat). For external validation, we used existing automatic organ segmentations, independent ground truth segmentations on gradient echo images, and the Amos data. We used non-parametric bootstrapping for confidence intervals and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for computing statistical significance. Results: We achieved an average Dice score of 0.90+-0.06 on our internal gradient echo test set, which included 71 semantic segmentation labels. Our model ties with the best model on Amos with a Dice of 0,81+-0.14, while having a larger field of view and a considerably higher number structures included. Conclusion: Our work presents a publicly available full-torso segmentation model for MRI and CT images that classifies almost all subject voxels to date.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Pneumonia Detection Using a Novel Multi-Scale Transformer Approach</title>

Abstract: Pneumonia, a prevalent respiratory infection, remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly among vulnerable populations. Chest X-rays serve as a primary tool for pneumonia detection; however, variations in imaging conditions and subtle visual indicators complicate consistent interpretation. Automated tools can enhance traditional methods by improving diagnostic reliability and supporting clinical decision-making. In this study, we propose a novel multi-scale transformer approach for pneumonia detection that integrates lung segmentation and classification into a unified framework. Our method introduces a lightweight transformer-enhanced TransUNet for precise lung segmentation, achieving a Dice score of 95.68% on the "Chest X-ray Masks and Labels" dataset with fewer parameters than traditional transformers. For classification, we employ pre-trained ResNet models (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101) to extract multi-scale feature maps, which are then processed through a modified transformer module to enhance pneumonia detection. This integration of multi-scale feature extraction and lightweight transformer modules ensures robust performance, making our method suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments. Our approach achieves 93.75% accuracy on the "Kermany" dataset and 96.04% accuracy on the "Cohen" dataset, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency. This work demonstrates the potential of multi-scale transformer architectures to improve pneumonia diagnosis, offering a scalable and accurate solution to global healthcare challenges. https://github.com/amirrezafateh/Multi-Scale-Transformer-Pneumonia</description>

      <title>ILeSiA: Interactive Learning of Robot Situational Awareness from Camera Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a promising approach for teaching robots new skills. However, a central challenge in the execution of acquired skills is the ability to recognize faults and prevent failures. This is essential because demonstrations typically cover only a limited set of scenarios and often only the successful ones. During task execution, unforeseen situations may arise, such as changes in the robot's environment or interaction with human operators. To recognize such situations, this paper focuses on teaching the robot situational awareness by using a camera input and labeling frames as safe or risky. We train a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model fed by a low-dimensional latent space representation of the input images. The model outputs a continuous risk score ranging from zero to one, quantifying the degree of risk at each timestep. This allows for pausing task execution in unsafe situations and directly adding new training data, labeled by the human user. Our experiments on a robotic manipulator show that the proposed method can reliably detect both known and novel faults using only a single example for each new fault. In contrast, a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) performs well only on faults it has encountered during training. Our method enables the next generation of cobots to be rapidly deployed with easy-to-set-up, vision-based risk assessment, proactively safeguarding humans and detecting misaligned parts or missing objects before failures occur. We provide all the code and data required to reproduce our experiments at imitrob.ciirc.cvut.cz/publications/ilesia.</description>

      <title>An Architecture Built for Federated Learning: Addressing Data Heterogeneity through Adaptive Normalization-Free Feature Recalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized collaborative training paradigm preserving stakeholders' data ownership while improving performance and generalization. However, statistical heterogeneity among client datasets degrades system performance. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Normalization-free Feature Recalibration (ANFR), a model architecture-level approach that combines weight standardization and channel attention to combat heterogeneous data in FL. ANFR leverages weight standardization to avoid mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging, ensuring robustness under heterogeneity, and channel attention to produce learnable scaling factors for feature maps, suppressing inconsistencies across clients due to heterogeneity. We demonstrate that combining these techniques boosts model performance beyond their individual contributions, by improving class selectivity and channel attention weight distribution. ANFR works with any aggregation method, supports both global and personalized FL, and adds minimal overhead. Furthermore, when training with differential privacy, ANFR achieves an appealing balance between privacy and utility, enabling strong privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance. By integrating weight standardization and channel attention in the backbone model, ANFR offers a novel and versatile approach to the challenge of statistical heterogeneity. Extensive experiments show ANFR consistently outperforms established baselines across various aggregation methods, datasets, and heterogeneity conditions.

      <title>Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing for Enhanced Straggler Resilience and Numerical Stability in Distributed CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim2Real Gap: Vision Encoder Pre-Training for Visuomotor Policy Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation offers a scalable and efficient alternative to real-world data collection for learning visuomotor robotic policies. However, the simulation-to-reality, or Sim2Real distribution shift -- introduced by employing simulation-trained policies in real-world environments -- frequently prevents successful policy transfer. We present an offline framework to evaluate the performance of using large-scale pre-trained vision encoders to address the Sim2Real gap. We examine a diverse collection of encoders, assessing their ability to extract features necessary for robot control (Action Score) while remaining invariant to task-irrelevant environmental variations (Domain Invariance Score). Evaluating 23 encoders, we reveal patterns across architectures, pre-training datasets, and parameter scales. Our findings show that manipulation-pretrained encoders consistently achieve higher Action Scores, CNN-based encoders demonstrate stronger domain invariance than ViTs, and the best-performing models combine both properties, underscoring DIS and AS as complementary predictors of Sim2Real transferability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Alignment of Unconditioned Action Prior for Language-conditioned Pick and Place in Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of language-conditioned pick and place in clutter, where a robot should grasp a target object in open clutter and move it to a specified place. Some approaches learn end-to-end policies with features from vision foundation models, requiring large datasets. Others combine foundation models in a zero-shot setting, suffering from cascading errors. In addition, they primarily leverage vision and language foundation models, focusing less on action priors. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective policy by integrating foundation priors from vision, language, and action. We propose A$^2$, an action prior alignment method that aligns unconditioned action priors with 3D vision-language priors by learning one attention layer. The alignment formulation enables our policy to train with less data and preserve zero-shot generalization capabilities. We show that a shared policy for both pick and place actions enhances the performance for each task, and introduce a policy adaptation scheme to accommodate the multi-modal nature of actions. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real-world show that our policy achieves higher task success rates with fewer steps for both pick and place tasks in clutter, effectively generalizing to unseen objects and language instructions.

      <title>Multimodal Latent Fusion of ECG Leads for Early Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in early assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) primarily focus on applying machine learning methods to centralized diagnostic modalities, such as 12-lead electrocardiogram (12L-ECG). Despite their potential, these approaches fall short in decentralized clinical settings, e.g., point-of-care and general practice, where handheld 6-lead ECG (6L-ECG) can offer an alternative but is limited by the scarcity of labeled data for developing reliable models. To address this, we propose a lead-specific electrocardiogram multimodal variational autoencoder (\textsc{LS-EMVAE}), which incorporates a hierarchical modality expert (HiME) fusion mechanism and a latent representation alignment loss. HiME combines mixture-of-experts and product-of-experts to enable flexible, adaptive latent fusion, while the alignment loss improves coherence among lead-specific and shared representations. To alleviate data scarcity and enhance representation learning, we adopt a transfer learning strategy: the model is first pre-trained on a large unlabeled 12L-ECG dataset and then fine-tuned on smaller task-specific labeled 6L-ECG datasets. We validate \textsc{LS-EMVAE} across two retrospective cohorts in a 6L-ECG setting: 892 subjects from the ASPIRE registry for (1) PH detection and (2) phenotyping pre-/post-capillary PH, and 16,416 subjects from UK Biobank for (3) predicting elevated pulmonary atrial wedge pressure, where it consistently outperforms unimodal and multimodal baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalizability and interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/Shef-AIRE/LS-EMVAE.</description>

      <title>Semi-SMD: Semi-Supervised Metric Depth Estimation via Surrounding Cameras for Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Semi-SD, a novel metric depth estimation framework tailored for surrounding cameras equipment in autonomous driving. In this work, the input data consists of adjacent surrounding frames and camera parameters. We propose a unified spatial-temporal-semantic fusion module to construct the visual fused features. Cross-attention components for surrounding cameras and adjacent frames are utilized to focus on metric scale information refinement and temporal feature matching. Building on this, we propose a pose estimation framework using surrounding cameras, their corresponding estimated depths, and extrinsic parameters, which effectively address the scale ambiguity in multi-camera setups. Moreover, semantic world model and monocular depth estimation world model are integrated to supervised the depth estimation, which improve the quality of depth estimation. We evaluate our algorithm on DDAD and nuScenes datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of surrounding camera based depth estimation quality.

      <title>Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning. Project Page: https://robodita.github.io.</description>

      <title>Efficient Unstructured Pruning of Mamba State-Space Models for Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks. However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings while broadening Mamba's applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content generation modeling has emerged as a promising direction in computational pathology, offering capabilities such as data-efficient learning, synthetic data augmentation, and task-oriented generation across diverse diagnostic tasks. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell boundary information is crucial for analyzing cell behaviors from time-lapse microscopy videos. Existing supervised cell segmentation tools, such as ImageJ, require tuning various parameters and rely on restrictive assumptions about the shape of the objects. While recent supervised segmentation tools based on convolutional neural networks enhance accuracy, they depend on high-quality labeled images, making them unsuitable for segmenting new types of objects not in the database. We developed a novel unsupervised cell segmentation algorithm based on fast Gaussian processes for noisy microscopy images without the need for parameter tuning or restrictive assumptions about the shape of the object. We derived robust thresholding criteria adaptive for heterogeneous images containing distinct brightness at different parts to separate objects from the background, and employed watershed segmentation to distinguish touching cell objects. Both simulated studies and real-data analysis of large microscopy images demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our approach compared with the alternatives.</description>

      <title>SUDER: Self-Improving Unified Large Multimodal Models for Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate vision-language alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are naturally inverse dual tasks, we propose \textbf{SUDER} (\textbf{S}elf-improving \textbf{U}nified LMMs with \textbf{D}ual s\textbf{E}lf-\textbf{R}ewards), a framework reinforcing the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs with a self-supervised dual reward mechanism. SUDER leverages the inherent duality between understanding and generation tasks to provide self-supervised optimization signals for each other. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood within the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.</description>

      <title>PRO: Projection Domain Synthesis for CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic CT projection data is crucial for advancing imaging research, yet its generation remains challenging. Current image domain methods are limited as they cannot simulate the physical acquisition process or utilize the complete statistical information present in projection data, restricting their utility and fidelity. In this work, we present PRO, a projection domain synthesis foundation model for CT imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that performs CT synthesis in the projection domain. Unlike previous approaches that operate in the image domain, PRO learns rich structural representations from projection data and leverages anatomical text prompts for controllable synthesis. Projection data generation models can utilize complete measurement signals and simulate the physical processes of scanning, including material attenuation characteristics, beam hardening, scattering, and projection geometry, and support research on downstream imaging tasks. Moreover, PRO functions as a foundation model, capable of generalizing across diverse downstream tasks by adjusting its generative behavior via prompt inputs. Experimental results demonstrated that incorporating our synthesized data significantly improves performance across multiple downstream tasks, including low-dose and sparse-view reconstruction. These findings underscore the versatility and scalability of PRO in data generation for various CT applications. These results highlight the potential of projection domain synthesis as a powerful tool for data augmentation and robust CT imaging.

      <title>LanternNet: A Hub-and-Spoke System to Seek and Suppress Spotted Lanternfly Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20800v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p &lt; 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.</description>

      <title>Identifying actionable driver mutations in lung cancer using an efficient Asymmetric Transformer Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.</description>

      <title>Hessian-Based Lightweight Neural Network HessNet for State-of-the-Art Brain Vessel Segmentation on a Minimal Training Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.</description>

      <title>SemLayoutDiff: Semantic Layout Generation with Diffusion Model for Indoor Scene Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent, realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

      <title>QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Learn2Reg 2024: New Benchmark Datasets Driving Progress on New Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for clinical applications, and fair benchmarking of different methods is essential for monitoring ongoing progress. To date, the Learn2Reg 2020-2023 challenges have released several complementary datasets and established metrics for evaluations. However, these editions did not capture all aspects of the registration problem, particularly in terms of modality diversity and task complexity. To address these limitations, the 2024 edition introduces three new tasks, including large-scale multi-modal registration and unsupervised inter-subject brain registration, as well as the first microscopy-focused benchmark within Learn2Reg. The new datasets also inspired new method developments, including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment and instance optimisation.</description>

      <title>Insights from Gradient Dynamics: Gradient Autoscaled Normalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification, stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide insights for future optimization research.</description>

      <title>Hyper Diffusion Avatars: Dynamic Human Avatar Generation using Network Weight Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars. However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand, generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time, controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale, cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.</description>

      <title>DEXOP: A Device for Robotic Transfer of Dexterous Human Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision + tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity.

      <title>AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.</description>

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving, entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents, featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a $90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.
