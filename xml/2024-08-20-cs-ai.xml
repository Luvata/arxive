      <title>Unleash The Power of Pre-Trained Language Models for Irregularly Sampled Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), such as ChatGPT, have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing. This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by non-uniform sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work explores the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in this under-explored area. Furthermore, we present a unified PLM-based framework, ISTS-PLM, which integrates time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored for comprehensive intra and inter-time series modeling and includes a learnable input embedding layer and a task-specific output layer to tackle diverse ISTS analytical tasks. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a simple yet effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, and extrapolation, as well as few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare and biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Dialogue State Tracking for Playing GuessWhich Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GuessWhich is an engaging visual dialogue game that involves interaction between a Questioner Bot (QBot) and an Answer Bot (ABot) in the context of image-guessing. In this game, QBot's objective is to locate a concealed image solely through a series of visually related questions posed to ABot. However, effectively modeling visually related reasoning in QBot's decision-making process poses a significant challenge. Current approaches either lack visual information or rely on a single real image sampled at each round as decoding context, both of which are inadequate for visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that focuses on visually related reasoning through the use of a mental model of the undisclosed image. Within this framework, QBot learns to represent mental imagery, enabling robust visual reasoning by tracking the dialogue state. The dialogue state comprises a collection of representations of mental imagery, as well as representations of the entities involved in the conversation. At each round, QBot engages in visually related reasoning using the dialogue state to construct an internal representation, generate relevant questions, and update both the dialogue state and internal representation upon receiving an answer. Our experimental results on the VisDial datasets (v0.5, 0.9, and 1.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, as it achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all metrics and datasets, surpassing previous state-of-the-art models. Codes and datasets from our experiments are freely available at \href{https://github.com/xubuvd/GuessWhich}.</description>

      <title>Automated Design of Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We formulate a new research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, control flows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity.</description>

      <title>A theory of understanding for artificial intelligence: composability, catalysts, and learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding is a crucial yet elusive concept in artificial intelligence (AI). This work proposes a framework for analyzing understanding based on the notion of composability. Given any subject (e.g., a person or an AI), we suggest characterizing its understanding of an object in terms of its ability to process (compose) relevant inputs into satisfactory outputs from the perspective of a verifier. This highly universal framework can readily apply to non-human subjects, such as AIs, non-human animals, and institutions. Further, we propose methods for analyzing the inputs that enhance output quality in compositions, which we call catalysts. We show how the structure of a subject can be revealed by analyzing its components that act as catalysts and argue that a subject's learning ability can be regarded as its ability to compose inputs into its inner catalysts. Finally we examine the importance of learning ability for AIs to attain general intelligence. Our analysis indicates that models capable of generating outputs that can function as their own catalysts, such as language models, establish a foundation for potentially overcoming existing limitations in AI understanding.</description>

      <title>An Unsupervised Learning Framework Combined with Heuristics for the Maximum Minimal Cut Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Minimal Cut Problem (MMCP), a NP-hard combinatorial optimization (CO) problem, has not received much attention due to the demanding and challenging bi-connectivity constraint. Moreover, as a CO problem, it is also a daunting task for machine learning, especially without labeled instances. To deal with these problems, this work proposes an unsupervised learning framework combined with heuristics for MMCP that can provide valid and high-quality solutions. As far as we know, this is the first work that explores machine learning and heuristics to solve MMCP. The unsupervised solver is inspired by a relaxation-plus-rounding approach, the relaxed solution is parameterized by graph neural networks, and the cost and penalty of MMCP are explicitly written out, which can train the model end-to-end. A crucial observation is that each solution corresponds to at least one spanning tree. Based on this finding, a heuristic solver that implements tree transformations by adding vertices is utilized to repair and improve the solution quality of the unsupervised solver. Alternatively, the graph is simplified while guaranteeing solution consistency, which reduces the running time. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our framework and give a specific application. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against two techniques designed.</description>

      <title>String Diagram of Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical framework of optimal transports (OTs), namely string diagrams of OTs. Our target problem is a safety problem on string diagrams of OTs, which requires proving or disproving that the minimum transportation cost in a given string diagram of OTs is above a given threshold. We reduce the safety problem on a string diagram of OTs to that on a monolithic OT by composing cost matrices. Our novel reduction exploits an algebraic structure of cost matrices equipped with two compositions: a sequential composition and a parallel composition. We provide a novel algorithm for the safety problem on string diagrams of OTs by our reduction, and we demonstrate its efficiency and performance advantage through experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply optimization is a complex and challenging task in the magazine retail industry because of the fixed inventory assumption, irregular sales patterns, and varying product and point-of-sale characteristics. We introduce AthenIA, an industrialized magazine supply optimization solution that plans the supply for over 20,000 points of sale in France. We modularize the supply planning process into a four-step pipeline: demand sensing, optimization, business rules, and operating. The core of the solution is a novel group conformalized quantile regression method that integrates domain expert insights, coupled with a supply optimization technique that balances the costs of out-of-stock against the costs of over-supply. AthenIA has proven to be a valuable tool for magazine publishers, particularly in the context of evolving economic and ecological challenges.</description>

      <title>Understanding Enthymemes in Argument Maps: Bridging Argument Mining and Logic-based Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Argument mining is natural language processing technology aimed at identifying arguments in text. Furthermore, the approach is being developed to identify the premises and claims of those arguments, and to identify the relationships between arguments including support and attack relationships. In this paper, we assume that an argument map contains the premises and claims of arguments, and support and attack relationships between them, that have been identified by argument mining. So from a piece of text, we assume an argument map is obtained automatically by natural language processing. However, to understand and to automatically analyse that argument map, it would be desirable to instantiate that argument map with logical arguments. Once we have the logical representation of the arguments in an argument map, we can use automated reasoning to analyze the argumentation (e.g. check consistency of premises, check validity of claims, and check the labelling on each arc corresponds with thw logical arguments). We address this need by using classical logic for representing the explicit information in the text, and using default logic for representing the implicit information in the text. In order to investigate our proposal, we consider some specific options for instantiation.</description>

      <title>Robust Stochastic Shortest-Path Planning via Risk-Sensitive Incremental Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the pervasiveness of Stochastic Shortest-Path (SSP) problems in high-risk industries, such as last-mile autonomous delivery and supply chain management, robust planning algorithms are crucial for ensuring successful task completion while mitigating hazardous outcomes. Mainstream chance-constrained incremental sampling techniques for solving SSP problems tend to be overly conservative and typically do not consider the likelihood of undesirable tail events. We propose an alternative risk-aware approach inspired by the asymptotically-optimal Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) planning algorithm, which selects nodes along path segments with minimal Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Our motivation rests on the step-wise coherence of the CVaR risk measure and the optimal substructure of the SSP problem. Thus, optimizing with respect to the CVaR at each sampling iteration necessarily leads to an optimal path in the limit of the sample size. We validate our approach via numerical path planning experiments in a two-dimensional grid world with obstacles and stochastic path-segment lengths. Our simulation results show that incorporating risk into the tree growth process yields paths with lengths that are significantly less sensitive to variations in the noise parameter, or equivalently, paths that are more robust to environmental uncertainty. Algorithmic analyses reveal similar query time and memory space complexity to the baseline RRT* procedure, with only a marginal increase in processing time. This increase is offset by significantly lower noise sensitivity and reduced planner failure rates.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning LLMs for Autonomous Spacecraft Control: A Case Study Using Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompt. This study explores the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for autonomous spacecraft control, using the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games suite (KSPDG) as a testing environment. Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches face limitations in this domain due to insufficient simulation capabilities and data. By leveraging LLMs, specifically fine-tuning models like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA, we demonstrate how these models can effectively control spacecraft using language-based inputs and outputs. Our approach integrates real-time mission telemetry into textual prompts processed by the LLM, which then generate control actions via an agent. The results open a discussion about the potential of LLMs for space operations beyond their nominal use for text-related tasks. Future work aims to expand this methodology to other space control tasks and evaluate the performance of different LLM families. The code is available at this URL: \texttt{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}.</description>

      <title>LLM-PCGC: Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key to effective point cloud compression is to obtain a robust context model consistent with complex 3D data structures. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted their capabilities not only as powerful generators for in-context learning and generation but also as effective compressors. These dual attributes of LLMs make them particularly well-suited to meet the demands of data compression. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of using LLM for compression tasks, focusing on lossless point cloud geometry compression (PCGC) experiments. However, applying LLM directly to PCGC tasks presents some significant challenges, i.e., LLM does not understand the structure of the point cloud well, and it is a difficult task to fill the gap between text and point cloud through text description, especially for large complicated and small shapeless point clouds. To address these problems, we introduce a novel architecture, namely the Large Language Model-based Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LLM-PCGC) method, using LLM to compress point cloud geometry information without any text description or aligning operation. By utilizing different adaptation techniques for cross-modality representation alignment and semantic consistency, including clustering, K-tree, token mapping invariance, and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the proposed method can translate LLM to a compressor/generator for point cloud. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure to employ LLM as a compressor for point cloud data. Experiments demonstrate that the LLM-PCGC outperforms the other existing methods significantly, by achieving -40.213% bit rate reduction compared to the reference software of MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) standard, and by achieving -2.267% bit rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art learning-based method.</description>

Abstract: The NFDI4DataScience (NFDI4DS) project aims to enhance the accessibility and interoperability of research data within Data Science (DS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) by connecting digital artifacts and ensuring they adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. To this end, this poster introduces the NFDI4DS Ontology, which describes resources in DS and AI and models the structure of the NFDI4DS consortium. Built upon the NFDICore ontology and mapped to the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), this ontology serves as the foundation for the NFDI4DS knowledge graph currently under development.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Parameter Learning in Probabilistic Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter learning is a crucial task in the field of Statistical Relational Artificial Intelligence: given a probabilistic logic program and a set of observations in the form of interpretations, the goal is to learn the probabilities of the facts in the program such that the probabilities of the interpretations are maximized. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to solve such a task within the formalism of Probabilistic Answer Set Programming, both based on the extraction of symbolic equations representing the probabilities of the interpretations. The first solves the task using an off-the-shelf constrained optimization solver while the second is based on an implementation of the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that our proposals often outperform existing approaches based on projected answer set enumeration in terms of quality of the solution and in terms of execution time. The paper has been accepted at the ICLP2024 conference and is under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).</description>

      <title>Pessimistic Iterative Planning for Robust POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust partially observable Markov decision processes (robust POMDPs) extend classical POMDPs to handle additional uncertainty on the transition and observation probabilities via so-called uncertainty sets. Policies for robust POMDPs must not only be memory-based to account for partial observability but also robust against model uncertainty to account for the worst-case instances from the uncertainty sets. We propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP) framework, which finds robust memory-based policies for robust POMDPs. PIP alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting an adversarial (non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty sets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this adversarial POMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and use this evaluation in step (1) to select the next adversarial POMDP. Within PIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC through a recurrent neural network trained using supervision policies optimized for the adversarial POMDP. The empirical evaluation in four benchmark environments showcases improved robustness against a baseline method in an ablation study and competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art robust POMDP solver.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Evaluator: Measuring LLMs' Adherence to Task Evaluation Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs-as-a-judge is a recently popularized method which replaces human judgements in task evaluation (Zheng et al. 2024) with automatic evaluation using LLMs. Due to widespread use of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT4 and Llama3 are expected to have strong alignment with human preferences when prompted for a quality judgement, such as the coherence of a text. While this seems beneficial, it is not clear whether the assessments by an LLM-as-a-judge constitute only an evaluation based on the instructions in the prompts, or reflect its preference for high-quality data similar to its fine-tune data. To investigate how much influence prompting the LLMs-as-a-judge has on the alignment of AI judgements to human judgements, we analyze prompts with increasing levels of instructions about the target quality of an evaluation, for several LLMs-as-a-judge. Further, we compare to a prompt-free method using model perplexity as a quality measure instead. We aggregate a taxonomy of quality criteria commonly used across state-of-the-art evaluations with LLMs and provide this as a rigorous benchmark of models as judges. Overall, we show that the LLMs-as-a-judge benefit only little from highly detailed instructions in prompts and that perplexity can sometimes align better with human judgements than prompting, especially on textual quality.</description>

      <title>GeoTransformer: Enhancing Urban Forecasting with Geospatial Attention Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have focused on encoding urban spatial information into high-dimensional spaces, with notable efforts dedicated to integrating sociodemographic data and satellite imagery. These efforts have established foundational models in this field. However, the effective utilization of these spatial representations for urban forecasting applications remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce GeoTransformer, a novel structure that synergizes the Transformer architecture with geospatial statistics prior. GeoTransformer employs an innovative geospatial attention mechanism to incorporate extensive urban information and spatial dependencies into a unified predictive model. Specifically, we compute geospatial weighted attention scores between the target region and surrounding regions and leverage the integrated urban information for predictions. Extensive experiments on GDP and ride-share demand prediction tasks demonstrate that GeoTransformer significantly outperforms existing baseline models, showcasing its potential to enhance urban forecasting tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent wave of foundation models has witnessed tremendous success in computer vision (CV) and beyond, with the segment anything model (SAM) having sparked a passion for exploring task-agnostic visual foundation models. Empowered by its remarkable zero-shot generalization, SAM is currently challenging numerous traditional paradigms in CV, delivering extraordinary performance not only in various image segmentation and multi-modal segmentation (\eg, text-to-mask) tasks, but also in the video domain. Additionally, the latest released SAM 2 is once again sparking research enthusiasm in the realm of promptable visual segmentation for both images and videos. However, existing surveys mainly focus on SAM in various image processing tasks, a comprehensive and in-depth review in the video domain is notably absent. To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic review on SAM for videos in the era of foundation models. As the first to review the progress of SAM for videos, this work focuses on its applications to various tasks by discussing its recent advances, and innovation opportunities of developing foundation models on broad applications. We begin with a brief introduction to the background of SAM and video-related research domains. Subsequently, we present a systematic taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three key areas: video understanding, video generation, and video editing, analyzing and summarizing their advantages and limitations. Furthermore, comparative results of SAM-based and current state-of-the-art methods on representative benchmarks, as well as insightful analysis are offered. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by current research and envision several future research directions in the field of SAM for video and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence Act  (AI Act) came into force in the European Union (EU) on 1 August 2024. It is a key piece of legislation both for the citizens at the heart of AI technologies and for the industry active in the internal market. The AI Act imposes progressive compliance on organisations - both private and public - involved in the global value chain of AI systems and models marketed and used in the EU. While the Act is unprecedented on an international scale in terms of its horizontal and binding regulatory scope, its global appeal in support of trustworthy AI is one of its major challenges.</description>

      <title>CodeMirage: Hallucinations in Code Generated by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potentials in program generation and no-code automation. However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.</description>

      <title>Plan with Code: Comparing approaches for robust NL to DSL generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning in code is considered a more reliable approach for many orchestration tasks. This is because code is more tractable than steps generated via Natural Language and make it easy to support more complex sequences by abstracting deterministic logic into functions. It also allows spotting issues with incorrect function names with the help of parsing checks that can be run on code. Progress in Code Generation methodologies, however, remains limited to general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python. LLMs continue to face challenges with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs, leading to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors. This is more common for custom function names, that are typically part of the plan. Moreover, keeping LLMs up-to-date with newer function names is an issue. This poses a challenge for scenarios like task planning over a large number of APIs, since the plan is represented as a DSL having custom API names. In this paper, we focus on workflow automation in RPA (Robotic Process Automation) domain as a special case of task planning. We present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these strategies with a fine-tuned model. Our results showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric. However, with our optimizations, RAG approach is able to match the quality for in-domain API names in the test set. Additionally, it offers significant advantage for out-of-domain or unseen API names, outperforming Fine-Tuned model on similarity metric by 7 pts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Latent Space for Generating Peptide Analogs Using Protein Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating peptides with desired properties is crucial for drug discovery and biotechnology. Traditional sequence-based and structure-based methods often require extensive datasets, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we proposed a novel method that utilized autoencoder shaped models to explore the protein embedding space, and generate novel peptide analogs by leveraging protein language models. The proposed method requires only a single sequence of interest, avoiding the need for large datasets. Our results show significant improvements over baseline models in similarity indicators of peptide structures, descriptors and bioactivities. The proposed method validated through Molecular Dynamics simulations on TIGIT inhibitors, demonstrates that our method produces peptide analogs with similar yet distinct properties, highlighting its potential to enhance peptide screening processes.</description>

      <title>API-guided Dataset Synthesis to Finetune Large Code Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large code models (LCMs), pre-trained on vast code corpora, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide array of code-related tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a vital role in aligning these models with specific requirements and enhancing their performance in particular domains. However, synthesizing high-quality SFT datasets poses a significant challenge due to the uneven quality of datasets and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets.
  Inspired by APIs as high-level abstractions of code that encapsulate rich semantic information in a concise structure, we propose DataScope, an API-guided dataset synthesis framework designed to enhance the SFT process for LCMs in both general and domain-specific scenarios. DataScope comprises two main components: Dsel and Dgen. On one hand, Dsel employs API coverage as a core metric, enabling efficient dataset synthesis in general scenarios by selecting subsets of existing (uneven-quality) datasets with higher API coverage. On the other hand, Dgen recasts domain dataset synthesis as a process of using API-specified high-level functionality and deliberately-constituted code skeletons to synthesize concrete code.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate DataScope's effectiveness, with models fine-tuned on its synthesized datasets outperforming those tuned on unoptimized datasets five times larger. Furthermore, a series of analyses on model internals, relevant hyperparameters, and case studies provide additional evidence for the efficacy of our proposed methods. These findings underscore the significance of dataset quality in SFT and advance the field of LCMs by providing an efficient, cost-effective framework for constructing high-quality datasets. This contribution enhances performance across both general and domain-specific scenarios, paving the way for more powerful and tailored LCMs.</description>

      <title>Decoding the human brain tissue response to radiofrequency excitation using a biophysical-model-free deep MRI on a chip framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relies on radiofrequency (RF) excitation of proton spin. Clinical diagnosis requires a comprehensive collation of biophysical data via multiple MRI contrasts, acquired using a series of RF sequences that lead to lengthy examinations. Here, we developed a vision transformer-based framework that captures the spatiotemporal magnetic signal evolution and decodes the brain tissue response to RF excitation, constituting an MRI on a chip. Following a per-subject rapid calibration scan (28.2 s), a wide variety of image contrasts including fully quantitative molecular, water relaxation, and magnetic field maps can be generated automatically. The method was validated across healthy subjects and a cancer patient in two different imaging sites, and proved to be 94% faster than alternative protocols. The deep MRI on a chip (DeepMonC) framework may reveal the molecular composition of the human brain tissue in a wide range of pathologies, while offering clinically attractive scan times.</description>

      <title>Understanding Help-Seeking Behavior of Students Using LLMs vs. Web Search for Writing SQL Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth in the use of large language models (LLMs) in programming education is altering how students write SQL queries. Traditionally, students relied heavily on web search for coding assistance, but this has shifted with the adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT. However, the comparative process and outcomes of using web search versus LLMs for coding help remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a randomized interview study in a database classroom to compare web search and LLMs, including a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) and an instructor-tuned LLM, for writing SQL queries. Our findings indicate that using an instructor-tuned LLM required significantly more interactions than both ChatGPT and web search, but resulted in a similar number of edits to the final SQL query. No significant differences were found in the quality of the final SQL queries between conditions, although the LLM conditions directionally showed higher query quality. Furthermore, students using instructor-tuned LLM reported a lower mental demand. These results have implications for learning and productivity in programming education.</description>

      <title>Assessing and Enhancing Large Language Models in Rare Disease Question-answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in general medical domains, questions remain about their performance in diagnosing rare diseases. To answer this question, we aim to assess the diagnostic performance of LLMs in rare diseases, and explore methods to enhance their effectiveness in this area. In this work, we introduce a rare disease question-answering (ReDis-QA) dataset to evaluate the performance of LLMs in diagnosing rare diseases. Specifically, we collected 1360 high-quality question-answer pairs within the ReDis-QA dataset, covering 205 rare diseases. Additionally, we annotated meta-data for each question, facilitating the extraction of subsets specific to any given disease and its property. Based on the ReDis-QA dataset, we benchmarked several open-source LLMs, revealing that diagnosing rare diseases remains a significant challenge for these models.
  To facilitate retrieval augmentation generation for rare disease diagnosis, we collect the first rare diseases corpus (ReCOP), sourced from the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) database. Specifically, we split the report of each rare disease into multiple chunks, each representing a different property of the disease, including their overview, symptoms, causes, effects, related disorders, diagnosis, and standard therapies. This structure ensures that the information within each chunk aligns consistently with a question. Experiment results demonstrate that ReCOP can effectively improve the accuracy of LLMs on the ReDis-QA dataset by an average of 8%. Moreover, it significantly guides LLMs to generate trustworthy answers and explanations that can be traced back to existing literature.</description>

      <title>Predictive uncertainty estimation in deep learning for lung carcinoma classification in digital pathology under real dataset shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown tremendous progress in a wide range of digital pathology and medical image classification tasks. Its integration into safe clinical decision-making support requires robust and reliable models. However, real-world data comes with diversities that often lie outside the intended source distribution. Moreover, when test samples are dramatically different, clinical decision-making is greatly affected. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in models is crucial for well-calibrated predictions and determining when (or not) to trust a model. Unfortunately, many works have overlooked the importance of predictive uncertainty estimation. This paper evaluates whether predictive uncertainty estimation adds robustness to deep learning-based diagnostic decision-making systems. We investigate the effect of various carcinoma distribution shift scenarios on predictive performance and calibration. We first systematically investigate three popular methods for improving predictive uncertainty: Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble, and few-shot learning on lung adenocarcinoma classification as a primary disease in whole slide images. Secondly, we compare the effectiveness of the methods in terms of performance and calibration under clinically relevant distribution shifts such as in-distribution shifts comprising primary disease sub-types and other characterization analysis data; out-of-distribution shifts comprising well-differentiated cases, different organ origin, and imaging modality shifts. While studies on uncertainty estimation exist, to our best knowledge, no rigorous large-scale benchmark compares predictive uncertainty estimation including these dataset shifts for lung carcinoma classification.</description>

      <title>PQV-Mobile: A Combined Pruning and Quantization Toolkit to Optimize Vision Transformers for Mobile Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViTs) are extremely effective at computer vision tasks and are replacing convolutional neural networks as the new state-of-the-art, they are complex and memory-intensive models. In order to effectively run these models on resource-constrained mobile/edge systems, there is a need to not only compress these models but also to optimize them and convert them into deployment-friendly formats. To this end, this paper presents a combined pruning and quantization tool, called PQV-Mobile, to optimize vision transformers for mobile applications. The tool is able to support different types of structured pruning based on magnitude importance, Taylor importance, and Hessian importance. It also supports quantization from FP32 to FP16 and int8, targeting different mobile hardware backends. We demonstrate the capabilities of our tool and show important latency-memory-accuracy trade-offs for different amounts of pruning and int8 quantization with Facebook Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) models. Our results show that even pruning a DeiT model by 9.375% and quantizing it to int8 from FP32 followed by optimizing for mobile applications, we find a latency reduction by 7.18X with a small accuracy loss of 2.24%. The tool is open source.</description>

      <title>W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG by utilizing the ranking capabilities of LLMs to create weakly labeled data for training dense retrievers. Specifically, we rerank the top-$K$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that LLMs will generate the correct answer based on the question and each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive training examples for dense retrieval. Our comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.</description>

      <title>SpectralEarth: Training Hyperspectral Foundation Models at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have triggered a paradigm shift in computer vision and are increasingly being adopted in remote sensing, particularly for multispectral imagery. Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538,974 image patches covering 415,153 unique locations from more than 11,636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. Additionally, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multi-temporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth. We integrate a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct four downstream datasets for land-cover and crop-type mapping, providing benchmarks for model evaluation.

      <title>Efficient Data-Sketches and Fine-Tuning for Early Detection of Distributional Drift in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributional drift detection is important in medical applications as it helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of models by identifying changes in the underlying data distribution that could affect diagnostic or treatment decisions. However, current methods have limitations in detecting drift; for example, the inclusion of abnormal datasets can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper presents an accurate and sensitive approach to detect distributional drift in CT-scan medical images by leveraging data-sketching and fine-tuning techniques. We developed a robust baseline library model for real-time anomaly detection, allowing for efficient comparison of incoming images and identification of anomalies. Additionally, we fine-tuned a vision transformer pre-trained model to extract relevant features using breast cancer images as an example, significantly enhancing model accuracy to 99.11\%. Combining with data-sketches and fine-tuning, our feature extraction evaluation demonstrated that cosine similarity scores between similar datasets provide greater improvements, from around 50\% increased to 100\%. Finally, the sensitivity evaluation shows that our solutions are highly sensitive to even 1\% salt-and-pepper and speckle noise, and it is not sensitive to lighting noise (e.g., lighting conditions have no impact on data drift). The proposed methods offer a scalable and reliable solution for maintaining the accuracy of diagnostic models in dynamic clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Assistant Selection for Improved Inference Acceleration with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their widespread adoption, large language models (LLMs) remain prohibitive to use under resource constraints, with their ever growing sizes only increasing the barrier for use. One noted issue is the high latency associated with auto-regressive generation, rendering large LLMs use dependent on advanced computing infrastructure. Assisted decoding, where a smaller draft model guides a larger target model's generation, has helped alleviate this, but remains dependent on alignment between the two models. Thus if the draft model is insufficiently capable on some domain relative to the target model, performance can degrade. Alternatively, one can leverage multiple draft models to better cover the expertise of the target, but when multiple black-box draft models are available, selecting an assistant without details about its construction can be difficult. To better understand this decision making problem, we observe it as a contextual bandit, where a policy must choose a draft model based on a context. We show that even without prior knowledge of the draft models, creating an offline dataset from only outputs of independent draft/target models and training a policy over the alignment of these outputs can accelerate performance on multiple domains provided the candidates are effective. Further results show this to hold on various settings with multiple assisted decoding candidates, highlighting its flexibility and the advantageous role that such decision making can play.</description>

      <title>Fairness Issues and Mitigations in (Differentially Private) Socio-demographic Data Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical agencies rely on sampling techniques to collect socio-demographic data crucial for policy-making and resource allocation. This paper shows that surveys of important societal relevance introduce sampling errors that unevenly impact group-level estimates, thereby compromising fairness in downstream decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization approach modeled on real-world survey design processes, ensuring sampling costs are optimized while maintaining error margins within prescribed tolerances. Additionally, privacy-preserving methods used to determine sampling rates can further impact these fairness issues. The paper explores the impact of differential privacy on the statistics informing the sampling process, revealing a surprising effect: not only the expected negative effect from the addition of noise for differential privacy is negligible, but also this privacy noise can in fact reduce unfairness as it positively biases smaller counts. These findings are validated over an extensive analysis using datasets commonly applied in census statistics.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Contrastive Learning Based Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data mining is immensely important in extensive applications, such as traffic, medical, and e-commerce. In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</description>

      <title>Ex3: Automatic Novel Writing by Extracting, Excelsior and Expanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models (LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes. Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By combining this structure information with the novel data, an instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.</description>

      <title>GS-ID: Illumination Decomposition on Gaussian Splatting via Diffusion Prior and Parametric Light Source Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GS-ID, a novel framework for illumination decomposition on Gaussian Splatting, achieving photorealistic novel view synthesis and intuitive light editing. Illumination decomposition is an ill-posed problem facing three main challenges: 1) priors for geometry and material are often lacking; 2) complex illumination conditions involve multiple unknown light sources; and 3) calculating surface shading with numerous light sources is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we first introduce intrinsic diffusion priors to estimate the attributes for physically based rendering. Then we divide the illumination into environmental and direct components for joint optimization. Last, we employ deferred rendering to reduce the computational load. Our framework uses a learnable environment map and Spherical Gaussians (SGs) to represent light sources parametrically, therefore enabling controllable and photorealistic relighting on Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments and applications demonstrate that GS-ID produces state-of-the-art illumination decomposition results while achieving better geometry reconstruction and rendering performance.</description>

      <title>Focus on Focus: Focus-oriented Representation Learning and Multi-view Cross-modal Alignment for Glioma Grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal deep learning, which integrates histopathology slides and molecular biomarkers, has achieved a promising performance in glioma grading. Despite great progress, due to the intra-modality complexity and inter-modality heterogeneity, existing studies suffer from inadequate histopathology representation learning and inefficient molecular-pathology knowledge alignment. These two issues hinder existing methods to precisely interpret diagnostic molecular-pathology features, thereby limiting their grading performance. Moreover, the real-world applicability of existing multimodal approaches is significantly restricted as molecular biomarkers are not always available during clinical deployment. To address these problems, we introduce a novel Focus on Focus (FoF) framework with paired pathology-genomic training and applicable pathology-only inference, enhancing molecular-pathology representation effectively. Specifically, we propose a Focus-oriented Representation Learning (FRL) module to encourage the model to identify regions positively or negatively related to glioma grading and guide it to focus on the diagnostic areas with a consistency constraint. To effectively link the molecular biomarkers to morphological features, we propose a Multi-view Cross-modal Alignment (MCA) module that projects histopathology representations into molecular subspaces, aligning morphological features with corresponding molecular biomarker status by supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on the TCGA GBM-LGG dataset demonstrate that our FoF framework significantly improves the glioma grading. Remarkably, our FoF achieves superior performance using only histopathology slides compared to existing multimodal methods.

      <title>Detecting Unsuccessful Students in Cybersecurity Exercises in Two Different Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This full paper in the research track evaluates the usage of data logged from cybersecurity exercises in order to predict students who are potentially at risk of performing poorly. Hands-on exercises are essential for learning since they enable students to practice their skills. In cybersecurity, hands-on exercises are often complex and require knowledge of many topics. Therefore, students may miss solutions due to gaps in their knowledge and become frustrated, which impedes their learning. Targeted aid by the instructor helps, but since the instructor's time is limited, efficient ways to detect struggling students are needed. This paper develops automated tools to predict when a student is having difficulty. We formed a dataset with the actions of 313 students from two countries and two learning environments: KYPO CRP and EDURange. These data are used in machine learning algorithms to predict the success of students in exercises deployed in these environments. After extracting features from the data, we trained and cross-validated eight classifiers for predicting the exercise outcome and evaluated their predictive power. The contribution of this paper is comparing two approaches to feature engineering, modeling, and classification performance on data from two learning environments. Using the features from either learning environment, we were able to detect and distinguish between successful and struggling students. A decision tree classifier achieved the highest balanced accuracy and sensitivity with data from both learning environments. The results show that activity data from cybersecurity exercises are suitable for predicting student success. In a potential application, such models can aid instructors in detecting struggling students and providing targeted help. We publish data and code for building these models so that others can adopt or adapt them.</description>

      <title>AgentSimulator: An Agent-based Approach for Data-driven Business Process Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business process simulation (BPS) is a versatile technique for estimating process performance across various scenarios. Traditionally, BPS approaches employ a control-flow-first perspective by enriching a process model with simulation parameters. Although such approaches can mimic the behavior of centrally orchestrated processes, such as those supported by workflow systems, current control-flow-first approaches cannot faithfully capture the dynamics of real-world processes that involve distinct resource behavior and decentralized decision-making. Recognizing this issue, this paper introduces AgentSimulator, a resource-first BPS approach that discovers a multi-agent system from an event log, modeling distinct resource behaviors and interaction patterns to simulate the underlying process. Our experiments show that AgentSimulator achieves state-of-the-art simulation accuracy with significantly lower computation times than existing approaches while providing high interpretability and adaptability to different types of process-execution scenarios.</description>

      <title>S-RAF: A Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework for Responsible Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) technology advances, ensuring the robustness and safety of AI-driven systems has become paramount. However, varying perceptions of robustness among AI developers create misaligned evaluation metrics, complicating the assessment and certification of safety-critical and complex AI systems such as autonomous driving (AD) agents. To address this challenge, we introduce Simulation-Based Robustness Assessment Framework (S-RAF) for autonomous driving. S-RAF leverages the CARLA Driving simulator to rigorously assess AD agents across diverse conditions, including faulty sensors, environmental changes, and complex traffic situations. By quantifying robustness and its relationship with other safety-critical factors, such as carbon emissions, S-RAF aids developers and stakeholders in building safe and responsible driving agents, and streamlining safety certification processes. Furthermore, S-RAF offers significant advantages, such as reduced testing costs, and the ability to explore edge cases that may be unsafe to test in the real world. The code for this framework is available here: https://github.com/cognitive-robots/rai-leaderboard</description>

      <title>A Mechanistic Interpretation of Syllogistic Reasoning in Auto-Regressive Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on logical reasoning in auto-regressive Language Models (LMs) have sparked a debate on whether such models can learn systematic reasoning principles during pre-training or merely exploit superficial patterns in the training data. This paper presents a mechanistic interpretation of syllogistic reasoning in LMs to further enhance our understanding of internal dynamics. Specifically, we present a methodology for circuit discovery aimed at disentangling content-independent reasoning mechanisms from world knowledge acquired during pre-training. Through two distinct intervention methods, we uncover a sufficient and necessary circuit involving middle-term suppression that elucidates how LMs transfer information to derive valid conclusions from premises. Furthermore, we investigate how belief biases manifest in syllogistic reasoning, finding evidence of partial contamination from additional attention heads responsible for encoding commonsense and contextualized knowledge. Finally, we explore the generalization of the discovered mechanisms across various syllogistic schemes and model sizes, finding that the identified circuit is sufficient and necessary for all the schemes on which the model achieves high downstream accuracy ($\geq$ 60\%). Overall, our findings suggest that LMs indeed learn transferable content-independent reasoning mechanisms, but that, at the same time, such mechanisms do not involve generalisable and abstract logical primitives, being susceptible to contamination by the same world knowledge acquired during pre-training.</description>

      <title>MM-UNet: A Mixed MLP Architecture for Improved Ophthalmic Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ophthalmic image segmentation serves as a critical foundation for ocular disease diagnosis. Although fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly employed for segmentation, they are constrained by inductive biases and face challenges in establishing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based models address these limitations but introduce substantial computational overhead. Recently, a simple yet efficient Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture was proposed for image classification, achieving competitive performance relative to advanced transformers. However, its effectiveness for ophthalmic image segmentation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce MM-UNet, an efficient Mixed MLP model tailored for ophthalmic image segmentation. Within MM-UNet, we propose a multi-scale MLP (MMLP) module that facilitates the interaction of features at various depths through a grouping strategy, enabling simultaneous capture of global and local information. We conducted extensive experiments on both a private anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) image dataset and a public fundus image dataset. The results demonstrated the superiority of our MM-UNet model in comparison to state-of-the-art deep segmentation networks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents our method for the generative track of The First Dataset Distillation Challenge at ECCV 2024. Since the diffusion model has become the mainstay of generative models because of its high-quality generative effects, we focus on distillation methods based on the diffusion model. Considering that the track can only generate a fixed number of images in 10 minutes using a generative model for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets, we need to use a generative model that can generate images at high speed. In this study, we proposed a novel generative dataset distillation method based on Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we use the SDXL-Turbo model which can generate images at high speed and quality. Compared to other diffusion models that can only generate images per class (IPC) = 1, our method can achieve an IPC = 10 for Tiny-ImageNet and an IPC = 20 for CIFAR-100, respectively. Additionally, to generate high-quality distilled datasets for CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we use the class information as text prompts and post data augmentation for the SDXL-Turbo model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieved third place in the generative track of the ECCV 2024 DD Challenge.

      <title>PatUntrack: Automated Generating Patch Examples for Issue Reports without Tracked Insecure Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security patches are essential for enhancing the stability and robustness of projects in the software community. While vulnerabilities are officially expected to be patched before being disclosed, patching vulnerabilities is complicated and remains a struggle for many organizations. To patch vulnerabilities, security practitioners typically track vulnerable issue reports (IRs), and analyze their relevant insecure code to generate potential patches. However, the relevant insecure code may not be explicitly specified and practitioners cannot track the insecure code in the repositories, thus limiting their ability to generate patches. In such cases, providing examples of insecure code and the corresponding patches would benefit the security developers to better locate and fix the insecure code. In this paper, we propose PatUntrack to automatically generating patch examples from IRs without tracked insecure code. It auto-prompts Large Language Models (LLMs) to make them applicable to analyze the vulnerabilities. It first generates the completed description of the Vulnerability-Triggering Path (VTP) from vulnerable IRs. Then, it corrects hallucinations in the VTP description with external golden knowledge. Finally, it generates Top-K pairs of Insecure Code and Patch Example based on the corrected VTP description. To evaluate the performance, we conducted experiments on 5,465 vulnerable IRs. The experimental results show that PatUntrack can obtain the highest performance and improve the traditional LLM baselines by +14.6% (Fix@10) on average in patch example generation. Furthermore, PatUntrack was applied to generate patch examples for 76 newly disclosed vulnerable IRs. 27 out of 37 replies from the authors of these IRs confirmed the usefulness of the patch examples generated by PatUntrack, indicating that they can benefit from these examples for patching the vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>DeepDFA: Automata Learning through Neural Probabilistic Relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce DeepDFA, a novel approach to identifying Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) from traces, harnessing a differentiable yet discrete model. Inspired by both the probabilistic relaxation of DFAs and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our model offers interpretability post-training, alongside reduced complexity and enhanced training efficiency compared to traditional RNNs. Moreover, by leveraging gradient-based optimization, our method surpasses combinatorial approaches in both scalability and noise resilience. Validation experiments conducted on target regular languages of varying size and complexity demonstrate that our approach is accurate, fast, and robust to noise in both the input symbols and the output labels of training data, integrating the strengths of both logical grammar induction and deep learning.</description>

      <title>SketchRef: A Benchmark Dataset and Evaluation Metrics for Automated Sketch Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketch, a powerful artistic technique to capture essential visual information about real-world objects, is increasingly gaining attention in the image synthesis field. However, evaluating the quality of synthesized sketches presents unique unsolved challenges. Current evaluation methods for sketch synthesis are inadequate due to the lack of a unified benchmark dataset, over-reliance on classification accuracy for recognizability, and unfair evaluation of sketches with different levels of simplification. To address these issues, we introduce SketchRef, a benchmark dataset comprising 4 categories of reference photos--animals, human faces, human bodies, and common objects--alongside novel evaluation metrics. Considering that classification accuracy is insufficient to measure the structural consistency between a sketch and its reference photo, we propose the mean Object Keypoint Similarity (mOKS) metric, utilizing pose estimation to assess structure-level recognizability. To ensure fair evaluation sketches with different simplification levels, we propose a recognizability calculation method constrained by simplicity. We also collect 8K responses from art enthusiasts, validating the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation methods. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive evaluation of sketch synthesis algorithms, thereby aligning their performance more closely with human understanding.</description>

      <title>RealMedQA: A pilot biomedical question answering dataset containing realistic clinical questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical question answering systems have the potential to provide clinicians with relevant and timely answers to their questions. Nonetheless, despite the advances that have been made, adoption of these systems in clinical settings has been slow. One issue is a lack of question-answering datasets which reflect the real-world needs of health professionals. In this work, we present RealMedQA, a dataset of realistic clinical questions generated by humans and an LLM. We describe the process for generating and verifying the QA pairs and assess several QA models on BioASQ and RealMedQA to assess the relative difficulty of matching answers to questions. We show that the LLM is more cost-efficient for generating "ideal" QA pairs. Additionally, we achieve a lower lexical similarity between questions and answers than BioASQ which provides an additional challenge to the top two QA models, as per the results. We release our code and our dataset publicly to encourage further research.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry due to their remarkable performance in various applications such as visual question answering, visual perception, understanding, and reasoning. Over the past few years, significant efforts have been made to examine MLLMs from multiple perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of \textbf{180 benchmarks} and evaluation for MLLMs, focusing on (1)perception and understanding, (2)cognition and reasoning, (3)specific domains, (4)key capabilities, and (5)other modalities. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the current evaluation methods for MLLMs and explore promising future directions. Our key argument is that evaluation should be regarded as a crucial discipline to better support the development of MLLMs. For more details, please visit our GitHub repository: https://github.com/swordlidev/Evaluation-Multimodal-LLMs-Survey.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Beyond Bias: A Study on Counterfactual Prompting and Chain of Thought Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models are known to absorb biases from their training data, leading to predictions driven by statistical regularities rather than semantic relevance. We investigate the impact of these biases on answer choice preferences in the Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding (MMLU) task. Our findings reveal that differences in learned regularities across answer options are predictive of model preferences and mirror human test-taking strategies. To address this issue, we introduce two novel methods: Counterfactual Prompting with Chain of Thought (CoT) and Counterfactual Prompting with Agnostically Primed CoT (APriCoT). We demonstrate that while Counterfactual Prompting with CoT alone is insufficient to mitigate bias, our novel Primed Counterfactual Prompting with CoT approach effectively reduces the influence of base-rate probabilities while improving overall accuracy. Our results suggest that mitigating bias requires a "System-2" like process and that CoT reasoning is susceptible to confirmation bias under some prompting methodologies. Our contributions offer practical solutions for developing more robust and fair language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept-based interpretability methods are a popular form of explanation for deep learning models which provide explanations in the form of high-level human interpretable concepts. These methods typically find concept activation vectors (CAVs) using a probe dataset of concept examples. This requires labelled data for these concepts -- an expensive task in the medical domain. We introduce TextCAVs: a novel method which creates CAVs using vision-language models such as CLIP, allowing for explanations to be created solely using text descriptions of the concept, as opposed to image exemplars. This reduced cost in testing concepts allows for many concepts to be tested and for users to interact with the model, testing new ideas as they are thought of, rather than a delay caused by image collection and annotation. In early experimental results, we demonstrate that TextCAVs produces reasonable explanations for a chest x-ray dataset (MIMIC-CXR) and natural images (ImageNet), and that these explanations can be used to debug deep learning-based models.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning via Flipping Weight Updates of Low-Activation Input Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models under the overall planning of the server while adhering to privacy requirements. However, the server cannot directly oversee the local training process, creating an opportunity for malicious clients to introduce backdoors. Existing research shows that backdoor attacks activate specific neurons in the compromised model, which remain dormant when processing clean data. Leveraging this insight, we propose a method called Flipping Weight Updates of Low-Activation Input Neurons (FLAIN) to defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning. Specifically, after completing global training, we employ an auxiliary dataset to identify low-activation input neurons and flip the associated weight updates. We incrementally raise the threshold for low-activation inputs and flip the weight updates iteratively, until the performance degradation on the auxiliary data becomes unacceptable. Extensive experiments validate that our method can effectively reduce the success rate of backdoor attacks to a low level in various attack scenarios including those with non-IID data distribution or high MCRs, causing only minimal performance degradation on clean data.</description>

      <title>A Multivocal Literature Review on Privacy and Fairness in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning presents a way to revolutionize AI applications by eliminating the necessity for data sharing. Yet, research has shown that information can still be extracted during training, making additional privacy-preserving measures such as differential privacy imperative. To implement real-world federated learning applications, fairness, ranging from a fair distribution of performance to non-discriminative behaviour, must be considered. Particularly in high-risk applications (e.g. healthcare), avoiding the repetition of past discriminatory errors is paramount. As recent research has demonstrated an inherent tension between privacy and fairness, we conduct a multivocal literature review to examine the current methods to integrate privacy and fairness in federated learning. Our analyses illustrate that the relationship between privacy and fairness has been neglected, posing a critical risk for real-world applications. We highlight the need to explore the relationship between privacy, fairness, and performance, advocating for the creation of integrated federated learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Layer Selection for Efficient Vision Transformer Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become widely available. However, their fine-tuning process is highly resource-intensive, and it hinders their adoption in several edge or low-energy applications. To this end, in this paper we introduce an efficient fine-tuning method for ViTs called $\textbf{ALaST}$ ($\textit{Adaptive Layer Selection Fine-Tuning for Vision Transformers}$) to speed up the fine-tuning process while reducing computational cost, memory load, and training time. Our approach is based on the observation that not all layers are equally critical during fine-tuning, and their importance varies depending on the current mini-batch. Therefore, at each fine-tuning step, we adaptively estimate the importance of all layers and we assign what we call ``compute budgets'' accordingly. Layers that were allocated lower budgets are either trained with a reduced number of input tokens or kept frozen. Freezing a layer reduces the computational cost and memory usage by preventing updates to its weights, while discarding tokens removes redundant data, speeding up processing and reducing memory requirements. We show that this adaptive compute allocation enables a nearly-optimal schedule for distributing computational resources across layers, resulting in substantial reductions in training time (up to 1.5x), FLOPs (up to 2x), and memory load (up to 2x) compared to traditional full fine-tuning approaches. Additionally, it can be successfully combined with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA.</description>

      <title>MAT-SED: AMasked Audio Transformer with Masked-Reconstruction Based Pre-training for Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sound event detection (SED) methods that leverage a large pre-trained Transformer encoder network have shown promising performance in recent DCASE challenges. However, they still rely on an RNN-based context network to model temporal dependencies, largely due to the scarcity of labeled data. In this work, we propose a pure Transformer-based SED model with masked-reconstruction based pre-training, termed MAT-SED. Specifically, a Transformer with relative positional encoding is first designed as the context network, pre-trained by the masked-reconstruction task on all available target data in a self-supervised way. Both the encoder and the context network are jointly fine-tuned in a semi-supervised manner. Furthermore, a global-local feature fusion strategy is proposed to enhance the localization capability. Evaluation of MAT-SED on DCASE2023 task4 surpasses state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.587/0.896 PSDS1/PSDS2 respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks are very hard to solve, because agents must consider the entire history of state-action pairs to act rationally in the environment. Most works use symbolic formalisms (as Linear Temporal Logic or automata) to specify the temporally-extended task. These approaches only work in finite and discrete state environments or continuous problems for which a mapping between the raw state and a symbolic interpretation is known as a symbol grounding (SG) function. Here, we define Neural Reward Machines (NRM), an automata-based neurosymbolic framework that can be used for both reasoning and learning in non-symbolic non-markovian RL domains, which is based on the probabilistic relaxation of Moore Machines. We combine RL with semisupervised symbol grounding (SSSG) and we show that NRMs can exploit high-level symbolic knowledge in non-symbolic environments without any knowledge of the SG function, outperforming Deep RL methods which cannot incorporate prior knowledge. Moreover, we advance the research in SSSG, proposing an algorithm for analysing the groundability of temporal specifications, which is more efficient than baseline techniques of a factor $10^3$.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, especially for topology attacks, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attack. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.</description>

      <title>SC-Rec: Enhancing Generative Retrieval with Self-Consistent Reranking for~Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly employed in recommendation systems due to their advanced language understanding and generation capabilities. Recent recommender systems based on generative retrieval have leveraged the inferential abilities of LMs to directly generate the index tokens of the next item, based on item sequences within the user's interaction history. Previous studies have mostly focused on item indices based solely on textual semantic or collaborative information. However, although the standalone effectiveness of these aspects has been demonstrated, the integration of this information has remained unexplored. Our in-depth analysis finds that there is a significant difference in the knowledge captured by the model from heterogeneous item indices and diverse input prompts, which can have a high potential for complementarity. In this paper, we propose SC-Rec, a unified recommender system that learns diverse preference knowledge from two distinct item indices and multiple prompt templates. Furthermore, SC-Rec adopts a novel reranking strategy that aggregates a set of ranking results, inferred based on different indices and prompts, to achieve the self-consistency of the model. Our empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates that SC-Rec considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for sequential recommendation, effectively incorporating complementary knowledge from varied outputs of the model.</description>

      <title>The Fellowship of the LLMs: Multi-Agent Workflows for Synthetic Preference Optimization Dataset Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates multi-agent workflows for synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) dataset generation. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) response evaluation, and (2) response generation. In the response evaluation module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. In each step, we use inter-rater agreement using Cohen's Kappa between human annotators and LLMs. For the response generation module, we compare different configurations for the LLM Feedback Loop using the identified LLM evaluator configuration. We use the win rate (the fraction of times a generation framework is selected as the best by an LLM evaluator) to determine the best multi-agent configuration for generation. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we use models from the GPT, Gemma, and Llama families to generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline. We generate two types of PO datasets, one to improve the generation capabilities of individual LLM and the other to improve the multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across datasets when the candidate responses do not include responses from the GPT family. Additionally, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-agent Llama and Gemma, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Student extracurricular activities play an important role in enriching the students' educational experiences. With the increasing popularity of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, it becomes a logical step that incorporating ML-NLP in improving extracurricular activities is a potential focus of study in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This research study aims to develop a machine learning workflow that will quantify the effectiveness of student-organized activities based on student emotional responses using sentiment analysis. The study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. A sample data set from Organization C, a Recognized Student Organization (RSO) of a higher educational institute in the Philippines, College X, was used to develop the workflow. The workflow consisted of data preprocessing, key feature selection, LLM feature processing, and score aggregation, resulting in an Event Score for each data set. The results show that the BERT LLM can also be used effectively in analyzing sentiment beyond product reviews and post comments. For the student affairs offices of educational institutions, this study can provide a practical example of how NLP can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential impact of data-driven decision making.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most assessments over-concentrate in evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth characteristic of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against unharmonised and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code and dataset will be available after the acceptance of this paper.</description>

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is promising for next-generation wireless networks but suffers from significant path loss, requiring extensive antenna arrays and frequent beam training. Traditional deep learning models, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), enhance beam tracking accuracy however are limited by poor robustness and generalization. In this letter, we use large language models (LLMs) to improve the robustness of beam prediction. By converting time series data into text-based representations and employing the Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP) technique for contextual enrichment, our approach unleashes the strength of LLMs for time series forecasting. Simulation results demonstrate that our LLM-based method offers superior robustness and generalization compared to LSTM-based models, showcasing the potential of LLMs in wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Beyond KAN: Introducing KarSein for Adaptive High-Order Feature Interaction Modeling in CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling feature interactions is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction, particularly when it comes to high-order explicit interactions. Traditional methods struggle with this task because they often predefine a maximum interaction order, which relies heavily on prior knowledge and can limit the model's effectiveness. Additionally, modeling high-order interactions typically leads to increased computational costs. Therefore, the challenge lies in adaptively modeling high-order feature interactions while maintaining efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein), designed to optimize both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We firstly identify limitations of directly applying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to CTR and then introduce KarSein to overcome these issues. It features a novel architecture that reduces the computational costs of KAN and supports embedding vectors as feature inputs. Additionally, KarSein employs guided symbolic regression to address the challenge of KAN in spontaneously learning multiplicative relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate KarSein's superior performance, achieving significant predictive accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, KarSein maintains strong global explainability while enabling the removal of redundant features, resulting in a sparse network structure. These advantages also position KarSein as a promising method for efficient inference.</description>

      <title>Correspondence-Guided SfM-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting for NVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) without Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pre-processed camera poses--referred to as SfM-free methods--is crucial for promoting rapid response capabilities and enhancing robustness against variable operating conditions. Recent SfM-free methods have integrated pose optimization, designing end-to-end frameworks for joint camera pose estimation and NVS. However, most existing works rely on per-pixel image loss functions, such as L2 loss. In SfM-free methods, inaccurate initial poses lead to misalignment issue, which, under the constraints of per-pixel image loss functions, results in excessive gradients, causing unstable optimization and poor convergence for NVS. In this study, we propose a correspondence-guided SfM-free 3D Gaussian splatting for NVS. We use correspondences between the target and the rendered result to achieve better pixel alignment, facilitating the optimization of relative poses between frames. We then apply the learned poses to optimize the entire scene. Each 2D screen-space pixel is associated with its corresponding 3D Gaussians through approximated surface rendering to facilitate gradient back propagation. Experimental results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>ASVspoof 5: Crowdsourced Speech Data, Deepfakes, and Adversarial Attacks at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges that promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake attacks, and the design of detection solutions. Compared to previous challenges, the ASVspoof 5 database is built from crowdsourced data collected from a vastly greater number of speakers in diverse acoustic conditions. Attacks, also crowdsourced, are generated and tested using surrogate detection models, while adversarial attacks are incorporated for the first time. New metrics support the evaluation of spoofing-robust automatic speaker verification (SASV) as well as stand-alone detection solutions, i.e., countermeasures without ASV. We describe the two challenge tracks, the new database, the evaluation metrics, baselines, and the evaluation platform, and present a summary of the results. Attacks significantly compromise the baseline systems, while submissions bring substantial improvements.</description>

      <title>A Transparency Paradox? Investigating the Impact of Explanation Specificity and Autonomous Vehicle Perceptual Inaccuracies on Passengers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency in automated systems could be afforded through the provision of intelligible explanations. While transparency is desirable, might it lead to catastrophic outcomes (such as anxiety), that could outweigh its benefits? It's quite unclear how the specificity of explanations (level of transparency) influences recipients, especially in autonomous driving (AD). In this work, we examined the effects of transparency mediated through varying levels of explanation specificity in AD. We first extended a data-driven explainer model by adding a rule-based option for explanation generation in AD, and then conducted a within-subject lab study with 39 participants in an immersive driving simulator to study the effect of the resulting explanations. Specifically, our investigation focused on: (1) how different types of explanations (specific vs. abstract) affect passengers' perceived safety, anxiety, and willingness to take control of the vehicle when the vehicle perception system makes erroneous predictions; and (2) the relationship between passengers' behavioural cues and their feelings during the autonomous drives. Our findings showed that passengers felt safer with specific explanations when the vehicle's perception system had minimal errors, while abstract explanations that hid perception errors led to lower feelings of safety. Anxiety levels increased when specific explanations revealed perception system errors (high transparency). We found no significant link between passengers' visual patterns and their anxiety levels. Our study suggests that passengers prefer clear and specific explanations (high transparency) when they originate from autonomous vehicles (AVs) with optimal perceptual accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Disease-Specific Foundation Model Using Over 100K Fundus Images: Release and Validation for Abnormality and Multi-Disease Classification on Downstream Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence applied to retinal images offers significant potential for recognizing signs and symptoms of retinal conditions and expediting the diagnosis of eye diseases and systemic disorders. However, developing generalized artificial intelligence models for medical data often requires a large number of labeled images representing various disease signs, and most models are typically task-specific, focusing on major retinal diseases. In this study, we developed a Fundus-Specific Pretrained Model (Image+Fundus), a supervised artificial intelligence model trained to detect abnormalities in fundus images. A total of 57,803 images were used to develop this pretrained model, which achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating that our proposed model outperforms other general methods. Our Image+Fundus model offers a generalized approach to improve model performance while reducing the number of labeled datasets required. Additionally, it provides more disease-specific insights into fundus images, with visualizations generated by our model. These disease-specific foundation models are invaluable in enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning models in the field of fundus imaging.</description>

      <title>CIKMar: A Dual-Encoder Approach to Prompt-Based Reranking in Educational Dialogue Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce CIKMar, an efficient approach to educational dialogue systems powered by the Gemma Language model. By leveraging a Dual-Encoder ranking system that incorporates both BERT and SBERT model, we have designed CIKMar to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, even with the constraints of a smaller language model size. Our evaluation reveals that CIKMar achieves a robust recall and F1-score of 0.70 using BERTScore metrics. However, we have identified a significant challenge: the Dual-Encoder tends to prioritize theoretical responses over practical ones. These findings underscore the potential of compact and efficient models like Gemma in democratizing access to advanced educational AI systems, ensuring effective and contextually appropriate responses.</description>

      <title>Constructing Domain-Specific Evaluation Sets for LLM-as-a-judge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the landscape of machine learning, yet current benchmarks often fall short in capturing the diverse behavior of these models in real-world applications. A benchmark's usefulness is determined by its ability to clearly differentiate between models of varying capabilities (separability) and closely align with human preferences. Existing frameworks like Alpaca-Eval 2.0 LC \cite{dubois2024lengthcontrolledalpacaevalsimpleway} and Arena-Hard v0.1 \cite{li2024crowdsourced} are limited by their focus on general-purpose queries and lack of diversity across domains such as law, medicine, and multilingual contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel data pipeline that curates diverse, domain-specific evaluation sets tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks. Our approach leverages a combination of manual curation, semi-supervised learning to generate clusters, and stratified sampling to ensure balanced representation across a wide range of domains and languages. The resulting evaluation set, which includes 1573 samples across 14 categories, demonstrates high separability (84\%) across ten top-ranked models, and agreement (84\%) with Chatbot Arena and (0.915) Spearman correlation. The agreement values are 9\% better than Arena Hard and 20\% better than AlpacaEval 2.0 LC, while the Spearman coefficient is 0.7 more than the next best benchmark, showcasing a significant improvement in the usefulness of the benchmark. We further provide an open-source evaluation tool that enables fine-grained analysis of model performance across user-defined categories, offering valuable insights for practitioners. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance the transparency, diversity, and effectiveness of LLM evaluation methodologies.</description>

      <title>EasyRec: Simple yet Effective Language Models for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have become a powerful technique for learning representations from user-item interaction data in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which limits their ability to perform well in practical zero-shot learning scenarios where sufficient training data may be unavailable. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their strong generalization capabilities, a crucial question arises: How can we harness the potential of language models to empower recommender systems and elevate its generalization capabilities to new heights? In this study, we propose EasyRec - an effective and easy-to-use approach that seamlessly integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework, which combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning, to ensure a strong alignment between the text-enhanced semantic space and the collaborative behavior information. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EasyRec compared to state-of-the-art alternative models, particularly in the challenging text-based zero-shot recommendation scenarios. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of seamlessly integrating EasyRec as a plug-and-play component into text-enhanced collaborative filtering frameworks, thereby empowering existing recommender systems to elevate their recommendation performance and adapt to the evolving user preferences in dynamic environments. For better result reproducibility of our EasyRec framework, the model implementation details, source code, and datasets are available at the link: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symmetries in Binary Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of group symmetries in binary classification tasks, presenting a novel framework that leverages the principles of Neyman-Pearson optimality. Contrary to the common intuition that larger symmetry groups lead to improved classification performance, our findings show that selecting the appropriate group symmetries is crucial for optimising generalisation and sample efficiency. We develop a theoretical foundation for designing group equivariant neural networks that align the choice of symmetries with the underlying probability distributions of the data. Our approach provides a unified methodology for improving classification accuracy across a broad range of applications by carefully tailoring the symmetry group to the specific characteristics of the problem. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that optimal classification performance is not always associated with the largest equivariant groups possible in the domain, even when the likelihood ratio is invariant under one of its proper subgroups, but rather with those subgroups themselves. This work offers insights and practical guidelines for constructing more effective group equivariant architectures in diverse machine-learning contexts.</description>

Abstract: This report introduces xGen-MM (also known as BLIP-3), a framework for developing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework comprises meticulously curated datasets, a training recipe, model architectures, and a resulting suite of LMMs. xGen-MM, short for xGen-MultiModal, expands the Salesforce xGen initiative on foundation AI models. Our models undergo rigorous evaluation across a range of tasks, including both single and multi-image benchmarks. Our pre-trained base model exhibits strong in-context learning capabilities and the instruction-tuned model demonstrates competitive performance among open-source LMMs with similar model sizes. In addition, we introduce a safety-tuned model with DPO, aiming to mitigate harmful behaviors such as hallucinations and improve safety. We open-source our models, curated large-scale datasets, and our fine-tuning codebase to facilitate further advancements in LMM research. Associated resources will be available on our project page above.</description>

Abstract: The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.</description>

      <title>PlotMap: Automated Layout Design for Building Game Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15242v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: World-building, the process of developing both the narrative and physical world of a game, plays a vital role in the game's experience. Critically-acclaimed independent and AAA video games are praised for strong world-building, with game maps that masterfully intertwine with and elevate the narrative, captivating players and leaving a lasting impression. However, designing game maps that support a desired narrative is challenging, as it requires satisfying complex constraints from various considerations. Most existing map generation methods focus on considerations about gameplay mechanics or map topography, while the need to support the story is typically neglected. As a result, extensive manual adjustment is still required to design a game world that facilitates particular stories. In this work, we approach this problem by introducing an extra layer of plot facility layout design that is independent of the underlying map generation method in a world-building pipeline.
  Concretely, we define (plot) facility layout tasks as the tasks of assigning concrete locations on a game map to abstract locations mentioned in a given story (plot facilities), following spatial constraints derived from the story. We present two methods for solving these tasks automatically: an evolutionary computation based approach through Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach. We develop a method of generating datasets of facility layout tasks, create a gym-like environment for experimenting with and evaluating different methods, and further analyze the two methods with comprehensive experiments, aiming to provide insights for solving facility layout tasks. We will release the code and a dataset containing 10, 000 tasks of different scales.</description>

      <title>MMP++: Motion Manifold Primitives with Parametric Curve Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17072v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion Manifold Primitives (MMP), a manifold-based approach for encoding basic motion skills, can produce diverse trajectories, enabling the system to adapt to unseen constraints. Nonetheless, we argue that current MMP models lack crucial functionalities of movement primitives, such as temporal and via-points modulation, found in traditional approaches. This shortfall primarily stems from MMP's reliance on discrete-time trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Motion Manifold Primitives++ (MMP++), a new model that integrates the strengths of both MMP and traditional methods by incorporating parametric curve representations into the MMP framework. Furthermore, we identify a significant challenge with MMP++: performance degradation due to geometric distortions in the latent space, meaning that similar motions are not closely positioned. To address this, Isometric Motion Manifold Primitives++ (IMMP++) is proposed to ensure the latent space accurately preserves the manifold's geometry. Our experimental results across various applications, including 2-DoF planar motions, 7-DoF robot arm motions, and SE(3) trajectory planning, show that MMP++ and IMMP++ outperform existing methods in trajectory generation tasks, achieving substantial improvements in some cases. Moreover, they enable the modulation of latent coordinates and via-points, thereby allowing efficient online adaptation to dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is a field that lives many lives, and the term has come to encompass a motley collection of scientific and commercial endeavours. In this paper, I articulate the contours of a rather neglected but central scientific role that AI has to play, which I dub `AI-as-exploration'.The basic thrust of AI-as-exploration is that of creating and studying systems that can reveal candidate building blocks of intelligence that may differ from the forms of human and animal intelligence we are familiar with. In other words, I suggest that AI is one of the best tools we have for exploring intelligence space, namely the space of possible intelligent systems. I illustrate the value of AI-as-exploration by focusing on a specific case study, i.e., recent work on the capacity to combine novel and invented concepts in humans and Large Language Models. I show that the latter, despite showing human-level accuracy in such a task, probably solve it in ways radically different, but no less relevant to intelligence research, to those hypothesised for humans.</description>

Abstract: Mid-level ontologies are used to integrate terminologies and data across disparate domains. There are, however, no clear, defensible criteria for determining whether a given ontology should count as mid-level, because we lack a rigorous characterization of what the middle level of generality is supposed to contain. Attempts to provide such a characterization have failed, we believe, because they have focused on the goal of specifying what is characteristic of those single ontologies that have been advanced as mid-level ontologies. Unfortunately, single ontologies of this sort are generally a mixture of top- and mid-level, and sometimes even of domain-level terms. To gain clarity, we aim to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for a collection of one or more ontologies to inhabit what we call a mid-level architecture.</description>

Abstract: The Common Core Ontologies (CCO) are designed as a mid-level ontology suite that extends the Basic Formal Ontology. CCO has since been increasingly adopted by a broad group of users and applications and is proposed as the first standard mid-level ontology. Despite these successes, documentation of the contents and design patterns of the CCO has been comparatively minimal. This paper is a step toward providing enhanced documentation for the mid-level ontology suite through a discussion of the contents of the eleven ontologies that collectively comprise the Common Core Ontology suite.</description>

Abstract: In our daily lives, as in science and in all other domains, we encounter huge numbers of dispositions (tendencies, potentials, powers) which are realized in processes such as sneezing, sweating, shedding dandruff, and on and on. Among this plethora of what we can think of as mere dispositions is a subset of dispositions in whose realizations we have an interest a car responding well when driven on ice, a rabbits lungs responding well when it is chased by a wolf, and so on. We call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide a robust ontological account of what capabilities are that is of sufficient generality to serve a variety of purposes, for example by providing a useful extension to ontology-based research in areas where capabilities data are currently being collected in siloed fashion.</description>

Abstract: The growing reliance on digital twins across various industries and domains brings with it semantic interoperability challenges. Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</description>

      <title>MMAU: A Holistic Benchmark of Agent Capabilities Across Diverse Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have increased the demand for comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities as human-like agents. Existing benchmarks, while useful, often focus on specific application scenarios, emphasizing task completion but failing to dissect the underlying skills that drive these outcomes. This lack of granularity makes it difficult to deeply discern where failures stem from. Additionally, setting up these environments requires considerable effort, and issues of unreliability and reproducibility sometimes arise, especially in interactive tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce the Massive Multitask Agent Understanding (MMAU) benchmark, featuring comprehensive offline tasks that eliminate the need for complex environment setups. It evaluates models across five domains, including Tool-use, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) QA, Data Science and Machine Learning coding, Contest-level programming and Mathematics, and covers five essential capabilities: Understanding, Reasoning, Planning, Problem-solving, and Self-correction. With a total of 20 meticulously designed tasks encompassing over 3K distinct prompts, MMAU provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLM agents. By testing 18 representative models on MMAU, we provide deep and insightful analyses. Ultimately, MMAU not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also enhances the interpretability of their performance. Datasets and evaluation scripts of MMAU are released at https://github.com/apple/axlearn/tree/main/docs/research/mmau.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a set of terms that are intended to act as an interface between cyber ontologies (like a file system ontology or a data fusion ontology) and top- and mid-level ontologies, specifically Basic Formal Ontology and the Common Core Ontologies.

      <title>SCENE: Evaluating Explainable AI Techniques Using Soft Counterfactuals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and accountability of AI models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, popular XAI methods such as LIME and SHAP have been found to be unstable and potentially misleading, underscoring the need for a standardized evaluation approach. This paper introduces SCENE (Soft Counterfactual Evaluation for Natural language Explainability), a novel evaluation method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate Soft Counterfactual explanations in a zero-shot manner. By focusing on token-based substitutions, SCENE creates contextually appropriate and semantically meaningful Soft Counterfactuals without extensive fine-tuning. SCENE adopts Validitysoft and Csoft metrics to assess the effectiveness of model-agnostic XAI methods in text classification tasks. Applied to CNN, RNN, and Transformer architectures, SCENE provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of various XAI techniques.</description>

      <title>Handling Distribution Shifts on Graphs: An Invariance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02466v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence suggesting neural networks' sensitivity to distribution shifts, so that research on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization comes into the spotlight. Nonetheless, current endeavors mostly focus on Euclidean data, and its formulation for graph-structured data is not clear and remains under-explored, given two-fold fundamental challenges: 1) the inter-connection among nodes in one graph, which induces non-IID generation of data points even under the same environment, and 2) the structural information in the input graph, which is also informative for prediction. In this paper, we formulate the OOD problem on graphs and develop a new invariant learning approach, Explore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization (EERM), that facilitates graph neural networks to leverage invariance principles for prediction. EERM resorts to multiple context explorers (specified as graph structure editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize the variance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables the model to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the common case for node-level prediction. We prove the validity of our method by theoretically showing its guarantee of a valid OOD solution and further demonstrate its power on various real-world datasets for handling distribution shifts from artificial spurious features, cross-domain transfers and dynamic graph evolution.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Multimodal Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal learning, which aims to understand and analyze information from multiple modalities, has achieved substantial progress in the supervised regime in recent years. However, the heavy dependence on data paired with expensive human annotations impedes scaling up models. Meanwhile, given the availability of large-scale unannotated data in the wild, self-supervised learning has become an attractive strategy to alleviate the annotation bottleneck. Building on these two directions, self-supervised multimodal learning (SSML) provides ways to learn from raw multimodal data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in SSML, in which we elucidate three major challenges intrinsic to self-supervised learning with multimodal data: (1) learning representations from multimodal data without labels, (2) fusion of different modalities, and (3) learning with unaligned data. We then detail existing solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we consider (1) objectives for learning from multimodal unlabeled data via self-supervision, (2) model architectures from the perspective of different multimodal fusion strategies, and (3) pair-free learning strategies for coarse-grained and fine-grained alignment. We also review real-world applications of SSML algorithms in diverse fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and machine translation. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for SSML.

      <title>Interactive Character Control with Auto-Regressive Motion Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time character control is an essential component for interactive experiences, with a broad range of applications, including physics simulations, video games, and virtual reality. The success of diffusion models for image synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive methods.</description>

      <title>SGFormer: Simplifying and Empowering Transformers for Large-Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10759v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning representations on large-sized graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature involved in massive data points. Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structured data, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its global attention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes. Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deep multi-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even using a one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance across node property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range from thousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the design philosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is a computation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme as Simplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simple attention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrary nodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings, feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to 141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs. Beyond current results, we believe the proposed methodology alone enlightens a new technical path of independent interest for building Transformers on large graphs.</description>

      <title>MKRAG: Medical Knowledge Retrieval Augmented Generation for Medical Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), although powerful in general domains, often perform poorly on domain-specific tasks such as medical question answering (QA). In addition, LLMs tend to function as "black-boxes", making it challenging to modify their behavior. To address the problem, our work employs a transparent process of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), aiming to improve LLM responses without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive retrieval strategy to extract medical facts from an external knowledge base, and then inject them into the LLM's query prompt. Focusing on medical QA, we evaluate the impact of different retrieval models and the number of facts on LLM performance using the MedQA-SMILE dataset. Notably, our retrieval-augmented Vicuna-7B model exhibited an accuracy improvement from 44.46% to 48.54%. This work underscores the potential of RAG to enhance LLM performance, offering a practical approach to mitigate the challenges posed by black-box LLMs.</description>

      <title>Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a "scaffolding" program that structures multiple calls to language models (LMs) to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed "improver" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying an LM several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.</description>

      <title>Federated Natural Policy Gradient and Actor Critic Methods for Multi-task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated reinforcement learning (RL) enables collaborative decision making of multiple distributed agents without sharing local data trajectories. In this work, we consider a multi-task setting, in which each agent has its own private reward function corresponding to different tasks, while sharing the same transition kernel of the environment. Focusing on infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, the goal is to learn a globally optimal policy that maximizes the sum of the discounted total rewards of all the agents in a decentralized manner, where each agent only communicates with its neighbors over some prescribed graph topology.
  We develop federated vanilla and entropy-regularized natural policy gradient (NPG) methods in the tabular setting under softmax parameterization, where gradient tracking is applied to estimate the global Q-function to mitigate the impact of imperfect information sharing. We establish non-asymptotic global convergence guarantees under exact policy evaluation, where the rates are nearly independent of the size of the state-action space and illuminate the impacts of network size and connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that near dimension-free global convergence is established for federated multi-task RL using policy optimization. We further go beyond the tabular setting by proposing a federated natural actor critic (NAC) method for multi-task RL with function approximation, and establish its finite-time sample complexity taking the errors of function approximation into account.</description>

      <title>Attacking Graph Neural Networks with Bit Flips: Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Indifferent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior attacks on graph neural networks have mostly focused on graph poisoning and evasion, neglecting the network's weights and biases. Traditional weight-based fault injection attacks, such as bit flip attacks used for convolutional neural networks, do not consider the unique properties of graph neural networks. We propose the Injectivity Bit Flip Attack, the first bit flip attack designed specifically for graph neural networks. Our attack targets the learnable neighborhood aggregation functions in quantized message passing neural networks, degrading their ability to distinguish graph structures and losing the expressivity of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Our findings suggest that exploiting mathematical properties specific to certain graph neural network architectures can significantly increase their vulnerability to bit flip attacks. Injectivity Bit Flip Attacks can degrade the maximal expressive Graph Isomorphism Networks trained on various graph property prediction datasets to random output by flipping only a small fraction of the network's bits, demonstrating its higher destructive power compared to a bit flip attack transferred from convolutional neural networks. Our attack is transparent and motivated by theoretical insights which are confirmed by extensive empirical results.</description>

Abstract: To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection. Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we study a different attack scenario, called Trojan Activation Attack (TA^2), which injects trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These malicious steering vectors can be triggered at inference time to steer the models toward attacker-desired behaviors by manipulating their activations. Our experiment results on four primary alignment tasks show that TA^2 is highly effective and adds little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks.</description>

      <title>MIMIR: Masked Image Modeling for Mutual Information-based Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve excellent performance in various tasks, but they are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Building robust ViTs is highly dependent on dedicated Adversarial Training (AT) strategies. However, current ViTs' adversarial training only employs well-established training approaches from convolutional neural network (CNN) training, where pre-training provides the basis for AT fine-tuning with the additional help of tailored data augmentations. In this paper, we take a closer look at the adversarial robustness of ViTs by providing a novel theoretical Mutual Information (MI) analysis in its autoencoder-based self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we show that MI between the adversarial example and its latent representation in ViT-based autoencoders should be constrained by utilizing the MI bounds. Based on this finding, we propose a masked autoencoder-based pre-training method, MIMIR, that employs an MI penalty to facilitate the adversarial training of ViTs. Extensive experiments show that MIMIR outperforms state-of-the-art adversarially trained ViTs on benchmark datasets with higher natural and robust accuracy, indicating that ViTs can substantially benefit from exploiting MI. In addition, we consider two adaptive attacks by assuming that the adversary is aware of the MIMIR design, which further verifies the provided robustness.</description>

      <title>Improving Task Instructions for Data Annotators: How Clear Rules and Higher Pay Increase Performance in Data Annotation in the AI Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global surge in AI applications is transforming industries, leading to displacement and complementation of existing jobs, while also giving rise to new employment opportunities. Data annotation, encompassing the labelling of images or annotating of texts by human workers, crucially influences the quality of a dataset directly influences the quality of AI models trained on it. This paper delves into the economics of data annotation, with a specific focus on the impact of task instruction design (that is, the choice between rules and standards as theorised in law and economics) and monetary incentives on data quality and costs. An experimental study involving 307 data annotators examines six groups with varying task instructions (norms) and monetary incentives. Results reveal that annotators provided with clear rules exhibit higher accuracy rates, outperforming those with vague standards by 14%. Similarly, annotators receiving an additional monetary incentive perform significantly better, with the highest accuracy rate recorded in the group working with both clear rules and incentives (87.5% accuracy). In addition, our results show that rules are perceived as being more helpful by annotators than standards and reduce annotators' difficulty in annotating images. These empirical findings underscore the double benefit of rule-based instructions on both data quality and worker wellbeing. Our research design allows us to reveal that, in our study, rules are more cost-efficient in increasing accuracy than monetary incentives. The paper contributes experimental insights to discussions on the economical, ethical, and legal considerations of AI technologies. Addressing policymakers and practitioners, we emphasise the need for a balanced approach in optimising data annotation processes for efficient and ethical AI development and usage.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hidden Triggers: Mapping Non-Markov Reward Functions to Markov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many Reinforcement Learning algorithms assume a Markov reward function to guarantee optimality. However, not all reward functions are Markov. This paper proposes a framework for mapping non-Markov reward functions into equivalent Markov ones by learning specialized reward automata, Reward Machines. Unlike the general practice of learning Reward Machines, we do not require a set of high-level propositional symbols from which to learn. Rather, we learn hidden triggers, directly from data, that construct them. We demonstrate the importance of learning Reward Machines over their Deterministic Finite-State Automata counterparts given their ability to model reward dependencies. We formalize this distinction in our learning objective. Our mapping process is constructed as an Integer Linear Programming problem. We prove that our mappings form a suitable proxy for maximizing reward expectations. We empirically validate our approach by learning black-box, non-Markov reward functions in the Officeworld domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of learning reward dependencies in a new domain, Breakfastworld.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering for Discrete Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrete distribution is often used to describe complex instances in machine learning, such as images, sequences, and documents. Traditionally, clustering of discrete distributions (D2C) has been approached using Wasserstein barycenter methods. These methods operate under the assumption that clusters can be well-represented by barycenters, which is seldom true in many real-world applications. Additionally, these methods are not scalable for large datasets due to the high computational cost of calculating Wasserstein barycenters. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using spectral clustering combined with distribution affinity measures (e.g., maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) to cluster discrete distributions. We demonstrate that these methods can be more accurate and efficient than barycenter methods. To further enhance scalability, we propose using linear optimal transport to construct affinity matrices efficiently for large datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of our methods in clustering distributions. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that our methods outperform existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Transformers and Cortical Waves: Encoders for Pulling In Context Across Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence - into a long "encoding vector" that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, "self-attention" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas or multiple regions at the whole-brain scale could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers.</description>

      <title>A Medical Data-Effective Learning Benchmark for Highly Efficient Pre-training of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on massive datasets, have achieved unprecedented generalizability. However, is it truly necessary to involve such vast amounts of data in pre-training, consuming extensive computational resources? This paper introduces data-effective learning, aiming to use data in the most impactful way to pre-train foundation models. This involves strategies that focus on data quality rather than quantity, ensuring the data used for training has high informational value. Data-effective learning plays a profound role in accelerating foundation model training, reducing computational costs, and saving data storage, which is very important as the volume of medical data in recent years has grown beyond many people's expectations. However, due to the lack of standards and comprehensive benchmarks, research on medical data-effective learning is poorly studied. To address this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically for evaluating data-effective learning in the medical field. This benchmark includes a dataset with millions of data samples from 31 medical centers (DataDEL), a baseline method for comparison (MedDEL), and a new evaluation metric (NormDEL) to objectively measure data-effective learning performance. Our extensive experimental results show the baseline MedDEL can achieve performance comparable to the original large dataset with only 5% of the data. Establishing such an open data-effective learning benchmark is crucial for the medical foundation model research community because it facilitates efficient data use, promotes collaborative breakthroughs, and fosters the development of cost-effective, scalable, and impactful healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>ExtremeCast: Boosting Extreme Value Prediction for Global Weather Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01295v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven weather forecast based on machine learning (ML) has experienced rapid development and demonstrated superior performance in the global medium-range forecast compared to traditional physics-based dynamical models. However, most of these ML models struggle with accurately predicting extreme weather, which is related to training loss and the uncertainty of weather systems. Through mathematical analysis, we prove that the use of symmetric losses, such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), leads to biased predictions and underestimation of extreme values. To address this issue, we introduce Exloss, a novel loss function that performs asymmetric optimization and highlights extreme values to obtain accurate extreme weather forecast. Beyond the evolution in training loss, we introduce a training-free extreme value enhancement module named ExBooster, which captures the uncertainty in prediction outcomes by employing multiple random samples, thereby increasing the hit rate of low-probability extreme events. Combined with an advanced global weather forecast model, extensive experiments show that our solution can achieve state-of-the-art performance in extreme weather prediction, while maintaining the overall forecast accuracy comparable to the top medium-range forecast models.</description>

      <title>Harm Amplification in Text-to-Image Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have emerged as a significant advancement in generative AI; however, there exist safety concerns regarding their potential to produce harmful image outputs even when users input seemingly safe prompts. This phenomenon, where T2I models generate harmful representations that were not explicit in the input prompt, poses a potentially greater risk than adversarial prompts, leaving users unintentionally exposed to harms. Our paper addresses this issue by formalizing a definition for this phenomenon which we term harm amplification. We further contribute to the field by developing a framework of methodologies to quantify harm amplification in which we consider the harm of the model output in the context of user input. We then empirically examine how to apply these different methodologies to simulate real-world deployment scenarios including a quantification of disparate impacts across genders resulting from harm amplification. Together, our work aims to offer researchers tools to comprehensively address safety challenges in T2I systems and contribute to the responsible deployment of generative AI models.</description>

      <title>ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach or deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present *ToolSword*, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing **malicious queries** and **jailbreak attacks** in the input stage, **noisy misdirection** and **risky cues** in the execution stage, and **harmful feedback** and **error conflicts** in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data is released in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/ToolSword.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores whether language models encode meaningfully grounded representations of sounds of objects. We learn a linear probe that retrieves the correct text representation of an object given a snippet of audio related to that object, where the sound representation is given by a pretrained audio model. This probe is trained via a contrastive loss that pushes the language representations and sound representations of an object to be close to one another. After training, the probe is tested on its ability to generalize to objects that were not seen during training. Across different language models and audio models, we find that the probe generalization is above chance in many cases, indicating that despite being trained only on raw text, language models encode grounded knowledge of sounds for some objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the landscape of generative artificial intelligence, diffusion-based models present challenges for socio-technical systems in data requirements and privacy. Traditional approaches like federated learning distribute the learning process but strain individual clients, especially with constrained resources (e.g., edge devices). In response to these challenges, we introduce CollaFuse, a novel framework inspired by split learning. Tailored for efficient and collaborative use of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, CollaFuse enables shared server training and inference, alleviating client computational burdens. This is achieved by retaining data and computationally inexpensive GPU processes locally at each client while outsourcing the computationally expensive processes to the shared server. Demonstrated in a healthcare context, CollaFuse enhances privacy by highly reducing the need for sensitive information sharing. These capabilities hold the potential to impact various application areas, such as the design of edge computing solutions, healthcare research, or autonomous driving. In essence, our work advances distributed machine learning, shaping the future of collaborative GenAI networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the vast repository of global medical knowledge predominantly being in English, local languages are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare services, particularly in areas with limited medical resources. To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a proxy-tuning fashion. We will open-source training corpora, code, model weights and evaluation benchmark.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research underscores the pivotal role of the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) feature representation field scale in determining the efficacy of models in OOD detection. Consequently, the adoption of model ensembles has emerged as a prominent strategy to augment this feature representation field, capitalizing on anticipated model diversity.
  However, our introduction of novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation methods, specifically Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and the Self-Coupling Index, reveals a critical drawback in existing ensemble methods. We find that these methods incorporate weights that are affine-transformable, exhibiting limited variability and thus failing to achieve the desired diversity in feature representation.
  To address this limitation, we elevate the dimensions of traditional model ensembles, incorporating various factors such as different weight initializations, data holdout, etc., into distinct supervision tasks. This innovative approach, termed Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble, leverages diverse training tasks to generate distinct comprehensions of the data and labels, thereby extending the feature representation field.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in OOD detection compared to both the naive Deep Ensemble method and a standalone model of comparable size. This underscores the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing the model's capability to detect instances outside its training distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA) seeks to adapt models trained on data from multiple labeled source domains to perform effectively on an unlabeled target domain data, assuming access to sources data. To address the challenges of model adaptation and data privacy, we introduce Collaborative MDA Through Optimal Transport (CMDA-OT), a novel framework consisting of two key phases. In the first phase, each source domain is independently adapted to the target domain using optimal transport methods. In the second phase, a centralized collaborative learning architecture is employed, which aggregates the N models from the N sources without accessing their data, thereby safeguarding privacy. During this process, the server leverages a small set of pseudo-labeled samples from the target domain, known as the target validation subset, to refine and guide the adaptation. This dual-phase approach not only improves model performance on the target domain but also addresses vital privacy challenges inherent in domain adaptation.</description>

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic skills make it possible to apply the high-level reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-level robotic control. A remaining challenge is to acquire a diverse set of fundamental skills. Existing approaches either manually decompose a complex task into atomic robotic actions in a top-down fashion, or bootstrap as many combinations as possible in a bottom-up fashion to cover a wider range of task possibilities. These decompositions or combinations, however, require an initial skill library. For example, a ``grasping'' capability can never emerge from a skill library containing only diverse ``pushing'' skills. Existing skill discovery techniques with reinforcement learning acquire skills by an exhaustive exploration but often yield non-meaningful behaviors. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for skill discovery that is entirely driven by LLMs. The framework begins with an LLM generating task proposals based on the provided scene description and the robot's configurations, aiming to incrementally acquire new skills upon task completion. For each proposed task, a series of reinforcement learning processes are initiated, utilizing reward and success determination functions sampled by the LLM to develop the corresponding policy. The reliability and trustworthiness of learned behaviors are further ensured by an independent vision-language model. We show that starting with zero skill, the skill library emerges and expands to more and more meaningful and reliable skills, enabling the robot to efficiently further propose and complete advanced tasks.

      <title>Surprise-Adaptive Intrinsic Motivation for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both entropy-minimizing and entropy-maximizing (curiosity) objectives for unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) have been shown to be effective in different environments, depending on the environment's level of natural entropy. However, neither method alone results in an agent that will consistently learn intelligent behavior across environments. In an effort to find a single entropy-based method that will encourage emergent behaviors in any environment, we propose an agent that can adapt its objective online, depending on the entropy conditions by framing the choice as a multi-armed bandit problem. We devise a novel intrinsic feedback signal for the bandit, which captures the agent's ability to control the entropy in its environment. We demonstrate that such agents can learn to control entropy and exhibit emergent behaviors in both high- and low-entropy regimes and can learn skillful behaviors in benchmark tasks. Videos of the trained agents and summarized findings can be found on our project page https://sites.google.com/view/surprise-adaptive-agents</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2024: Meningioma Radiotherapy Planning Automated Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2024 Brain Tumor Segmentation Meningioma Radiotherapy (BraTS-MEN-RT) challenge aims to advance automated segmentation algorithms using the largest known multi-institutional dataset of radiotherapy planning brain MRIs with expert-annotated target labels for patients with intact or postoperative meningioma that underwent either conventional external beam radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery. Each case includes a defaced 3D post-contrast T1-weighted radiotherapy planning MRI in its native acquisition space, accompanied by a single-label "target volume" representing the gross tumor volume (GTV) and any at-risk postoperative site. Target volume annotations adhere to established radiotherapy planning protocols, ensuring consistency across cases and institutions. For preoperative meningiomas, the target volume encompasses the entire GTV and associated nodular dural tail, while for postoperative cases, it includes at-risk resection cavity margins as determined by the treating institution. Case annotations were reviewed and approved by expert neuroradiologists and radiation oncologists. Participating teams will develop, containerize, and evaluate automated segmentation models using this comprehensive dataset. Model performance will be assessed using an adapted lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient and the 95% Hausdorff distance. The top-performing teams will be recognized at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Conference in October 2024. BraTS-MEN-RT is expected to significantly advance automated radiotherapy planning by enabling precise tumor segmentation and facilitating tailored treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Interaction with a Household Electricity Knowledge-based Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain specific digital twins, representing a digital replica of various segments of the smart grid, are foreseen as able to model, simulate, and control the respective segments. At the same time, knowledge-based digital twins, coupled with AI, may also empower humans to understand aspects of the system through natural language interaction in view of planning and policy making. This paper is the first to assess and report on the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) question answers related to household electrical energy measurement aspects leveraging a knowledge-based energy digital twin. Relying on the recently published electricity consumption knowledge graph that actually represents a knowledge-based digital twin, we study the capabilities of ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama in answering electricity related questions. Furthermore, we compare the answers with the ones generated through a RAG techniques that leverages an existing electricity knowledge-based digital twin. Our findings illustrate that the RAG approach not only reduces the incidence of incorrect information typically generated by LLMs but also significantly improves the quality of the output by grounding responses in verifiable data. This paper details our methodology, presents a comparative analysis of responses with and without RAG, and discusses the implications of our findings for future applications of AI in specialized sectors like energy data analysis.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuned 'Small' LLMs (Still) Significantly Outperform Zero-Shot Generative AI Models in Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI offers a simple, prompt-based alternative to fine-tuning smaller BERT-style LLMs for text classification tasks. This promises to eliminate the need for manually labeled training data and task-specific model training. However, it remains an open question whether tools like ChatGPT can deliver on this promise. In this paper, we show that smaller, fine-tuned LLMs (still) consistently and significantly outperform larger, zero-shot prompted models in text classification. We compare three major generative AI models (ChatGPT with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 and Claude Opus) with several fine-tuned LLMs across a diverse set of classification tasks (sentiment, approval/disapproval, emotions, party positions) and text categories (news, tweets, speeches). We find that fine-tuning with application-specific training data achieves superior performance in all cases. To make this approach more accessible to a broader audience, we provide an easy-to-use toolkit alongside this paper. Our toolkit, accompanied by non-technical step-by-step guidance, enables users to select and fine-tune BERT-like LLMs for any classification task with minimal technical and computational effort.</description>

      <title>DP-MemArc: Differential Privacy Transfer Learning for Memory Efficient Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have repeatedly shown outstanding performance across diverse applications. However, deploying these models can inadvertently risk user privacy. The significant memory demands during training pose a major challenge in terms of resource consumption. This substantial size places a heavy load on memory resources, raising considerable practical concerns. In this paper, we introduce DP-MemArc, a novel training framework aimed at reducing the memory costs of large language models while emphasizing the protection of user data privacy. DP-MemArc incorporates side network or reversible network designs to support a variety of differential privacy memory-efficient fine-tuning schemes. Our approach not only achieves in memory optimization but also ensures robust privacy protection, keeping user data secure and confidential. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DP-MemArc effectively provides differential privacy-efficient fine-tuning across different task scenarios.</description>

      <title>PEANO-ViT: Power-Efficient Approximations of Non-Linearities in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on hardware platforms, specially Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), presents many challenges, which are mainly due to the substantial computational and power requirements of their non-linear functions, notably layer normalization, softmax, and Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). These critical functions pose significant obstacles to efficient hardware implementation due to their complex mathematical operations and the inherent resource count and architectural limitations of FPGAs. PEANO-ViT offers a novel approach to streamlining the implementation of the layer normalization layer by introducing a division-free technique that simultaneously approximates the division and square root function. Additionally, PEANO-ViT provides a multi-scale division strategy to eliminate division operations in the softmax layer, aided by a Pade-based approximation for the exponential function. Finally, PEANO-ViT introduces a piece-wise linear approximation for the GELU function, carefully designed to bypass the computationally intensive operations associated with GELU. In our comprehensive evaluations, PEANO-ViT exhibits minimal accuracy degradation (&lt;= 0.5% for DeiT-B) while significantly enhancing power efficiency, achieving improvements of 1.91x, 1.39x, 8.01x for layer normalization, softmax, and GELU, respectively. This improvement is achieved through substantial reductions in DSP, LUT, and register counts for these non-linear operations. Consequently, PEANO-ViT enables efficient deployment of Vision Transformers on resource- and power-constrained FPGA platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Data Privacy in Large Language Models through Private Association Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools with extensive applications, but their tendency to memorize private information raises significant concerns as private data leakage can easily happen. In this paper, we introduce Private Association Editing (PAE), a novel defense approach for private data leakage. PAE is designed to effectively remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without retraining the model. Our approach consists of a four-step procedure: detecting memorized PII, applying PAE cards to mitigate memorization of private data, verifying resilience to targeted data extraction (TDE) attacks, and ensuring consistency in the post-edit LLMs. The versatility and efficiency of PAE, which allows for batch modifications, significantly enhance data privacy in LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAE in mitigating private data leakage. We believe PAE will serve as a critical tool in the ongoing effort to protect data privacy in LLMs, encouraging the development of safer models for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Neural Information Retrieval: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}. Along with the organization of existing work, we introduce a Benchmark for robust IR (BestIR), a heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for robust neural information retrieval, which is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/BestIR}. We hope that this study provides useful clues for future research on the robustness of IR models and helps to develop trustworthy search engines \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/Awesome-Robustness-in-Information-Retrieval}.</description>

      <title>Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for Efficient LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to their remarkable representation capabilities for heterogeneous graph data, Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted in many critical real-world domains such as recommendation systems and medical analysis. Prior to their practical application, identifying the optimal HGNN model parameters tailored to specific tasks through extensive training is a time-consuming and costly process. To enhance the efficiency of HGNN training, it is essential to characterize and analyze the execution semantics and patterns within the training process to identify performance bottlenecks. In this study, we conduct an in-depth quantification and analysis of two mainstream HGNN training scenarios, including single-GPU and multi-GPU distributed training. Based on the characterization results, we disclose the performance bottlenecks and their underlying causes in different HGNN training scenarios and provide optimization guidelines from both software and hardware perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose DropKAN (Dropout Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks) a regularization method that prevents co-adaptation of activation function weights in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). DropKAN functions by embedding the drop mask directly within the KAN layer, randomly masking the outputs of some activations within the KANs' computation graph. We show that this simple procedure that require minimal coding effort has a regularizing effect and consistently lead to better generalization of KANs. We analyze the adaptation of the standard Dropout with KANs and demonstrate that Dropout applied to KANs' neurons can lead to unpredictable behavior in the feedforward pass. We carry an empirical study with real world Machine Learning datasets to validate our findings. Our results suggest that DropKAN is consistently a better alternative to using standard Dropout with KANs, and improves the generalization performance of KANs. Our implementation of DropKAN is available at: \url{https://github.com/Ghaith81/dropkan}.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing market forecasts is pivotal in optimizing portfolio selection strategies. We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</description>

      <title>CoDefeater: Using LLMs To Find Defeaters in Assurance Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing assurance cases is a widely used, and sometimes required, process toward demonstrating that safety-critical systems will operate safely in their planned environment. To mitigate the risk of errors and missing edge cases, the concept of defeaters - arguments or evidence that challenge claims in an assurance case - has been introduced. Defeaters can provide timely detection of weaknesses in the arguments, prompting further investigation and timely mitigations. However, capturing defeaters relies on expert judgment, experience, and creativity and must be done iteratively due to evolving requirements and regulations. This paper proposes CoDefeater, an automated process to leverage large language models (LLMs) for finding defeaters. Initial results on two systems show that LLMs can efficiently find known and unforeseen feasible defeaters to support safety analysts in enhancing the completeness and confidence of assurance cases.</description>

      <title>TWIN V2: Scaling Ultra-Long User Behavior Sequence Modeling for Enhanced CTR Prediction at Kuaishou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of modeling long-term user interests for CTR prediction tasks in large-scale recommendation systems is progressively gaining attention among researchers and practitioners. Existing work, such as SIM and TWIN, typically employs a two-stage approach to model long-term user behavior sequences for efficiency concerns. The first stage rapidly retrieves a subset of sequences related to the target item from a long sequence using a search-based mechanism namely the General Search Unit (GSU), while the second stage calculates the interest scores using the Exact Search Unit (ESU) on the retrieved results. Given the extensive length of user behavior sequences spanning the entire life cycle, potentially reaching up to 10^6 in scale, there is currently no effective solution for fully modeling such expansive user interests. To overcome this issue, we introduced TWIN-V2, an enhancement of TWIN, where a divide-and-conquer approach is applied to compress life-cycle behaviors and uncover more accurate and diverse user interests. Specifically, a hierarchical clustering method groups items with similar characteristics in life-cycle behaviors into a single cluster during the offline phase. By limiting the size of clusters, we can compress behavior sequences well beyond the magnitude of 10^5 to a length manageable for online inference in GSU retrieval. Cluster-aware target attention extracts comprehensive and multi-faceted long-term interests of users, thereby making the final recommendation results more accurate and diverse. Extensive offline experiments on a multi-billion-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests have demonstrated the effectiveness of TWIN-V2. Under an efficient deployment framework, TWIN-V2 has been successfully deployed to the primary traffic that serves hundreds of millions of daily active users at Kuaishou.</description>

      <title>VersusDebias: Universal Zero-Shot Debiasing for Text-to-Image Models via SLM-Based Prompt Engineering and Generative Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Text-to-Image (T2I) models, biases in human image generation against demographic social groups become a significant concern, impacting fairness and ethical standards in AI. Some researchers propose their methods to tackle with the issue. However, existing methods are designed for specific models with fixed prompts, limiting their adaptability to the fast-evolving models and diverse practical scenarios. Moreover, they neglect the impact of hallucinations, leading to discrepancies between expected and actual results. To address these issues, we introduce VersusDebias, a novel and universal debiasing framework for biases in arbitrary T2I models, consisting of an array generation (AG) module and an image generation (IG) module. The self-adaptive AG module generates specialized attribute arrays to post-process hallucinations and debias multiple attributes simultaneously. The IG module employs a small language model to modify prompts according to the arrays and drives the T2I model to generate debiased images, enabling zero-shot debiasing. Extensive experiments demonstrate VersusDebias's capability to debias any models across gender, race, and age simultaneously. In both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, VersusDebias outperforms existing methods, showcasing its exceptional utility. Our work is accessible at https://github.com/VersusDebias/VersusDebias to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing of Knee Osteoarthritis Progression with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease, which has no cure. Knee OA (KOA) is one of the highest causes of disability worldwide, and it costs billions of United States dollars to the global community. Prediction of KOA progression has been of high interest to the community for years, as it can advance treatment development through more efficient clinical trials and improve patient outcomes through more efficient healthcare utilization. Existing approaches for predicting KOA, however, are predominantly static, i.e. consider data from a single time point to predict progression many years into the future, and knee level, i.e. consider progression in a single joint only. Due to these and related reasons, these methods fail to deliver the level of predictive performance, which is sufficient to result in cost savings and better patient outcomes. Collecting extensive data from all patients on a regular basis could address the issue, but it is limited by the high cost at a population level. In this work, we propose to go beyond static prediction models in OA, and bring a novel Active Sensing (AS) approach, designed to dynamically follow up patients with the objective of maximizing the number of informative data acquisitions, while minimizing their total cost over a period of time. Our approach is based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and it leverages a novel reward function designed specifically for AS of disease progression in more than one part of a human body. Our method is end-to-end, relies on multi-modal Deep Learning, and requires no human input at inference time. Throughout an exhaustive experimental evaluation, we show that using RL can provide a higher monetary benefit when compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Personalizing Federated Instrument Segmentation with Visual Trait Priors in Robotic Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51% Dice, +2.11% IoU, -2.79 ASSD, -15.55 HD95 performance gains. The corresponding code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/PFedSIS.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Non-Native Language Context Limitation: Native Language Prompting Facilitates Knowledge Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) struggle to answer questions posed in non-dominant languages, even though they have acquired the relevant knowledge from their dominant language corpus. In contrast, human multilinguals can overcome such non-native language context limitations through Positive Native Language Transfer (PNLT). Inspired by the process of PNLT, we analogize the dominant language of MLLMs to the native language of human multilinguals, and propose Native Language Prompting (NatLan) to simulate the PNLT observed in human multilinguals. It explicitly creates native language contexts for MLLMs to facilitate the elicitation of the rich native language knowledge during question-answering, unlocking the limitations imposed by non-native language contexts. By employing multi-MLLM collaboration, NatLan reduces the workload on each MLLM in simulating PNLT and refines semantic transfer. On the C-Eval benchmark, NatLan provides up to a 10.1% average accuracy improvement and up to a 5.0% increase in the hard-level subset across five MLLMs, surpassing all top-notch related methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/AnonyNLP/NatLan.</description>

      <title>Activations Through Extensions: A Framework To Boost Performance Of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation functions are non-linearities in neural networks that allow them to learn complex mapping between inputs and outputs. Typical choices for activation functions are ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid etc., where the choice generally depends on the application domain. In this work, we propose a framework/strategy that unifies several works on activation functions and theoretically explains the performance benefits of these works. We also propose novel techniques that originate from the framework and allow us to obtain ``extensions'' (i.e. special generalizations of a given neural network) of neural networks through operations on activation functions. We theoretically and empirically show that ``extensions'' of neural networks have performance benefits compared to vanilla neural networks with insignificant space and time complexity costs on standard test functions. We also show the benefits of neural network ``extensions'' in the time-series domain on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>RT-Surv: Improving Mortality Prediction After Radiotherapy with Large Language Model Structuring of Large-Scale Unstructured Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate patient selection is critical in radiotherapy (RT) to prevent ineffective treatments. Traditional survival prediction models, relying on structured data, often lack precision. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to structure unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, thereby improving survival prediction accuracy through comprehensive clinical information integration. Data from 34,276 patients treated with RT at Yonsei Cancer Center between 2013 and 2023 were analyzed, encompassing both structured and unstructured data. An open-source LLM was used to structure the unstructured EHR data via single-shot learning, with its performance compared against a domain-specific medical LLM and a smaller variant. Survival prediction models were developed using statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, incorporating both structured and LLM-structured data. Clinical experts evaluated the accuracy of the LLM-structured data. The open-source LLM achieved 87.5% accuracy in structuring unstructured EHR data without additional training, significantly outperforming the domain-specific medical LLM, which reached only 35.8% accuracy. Larger LLMs were more effective, particularly in extracting clinically relevant features like general condition and disease extent, which closely correlated with patient survival. Incorporating LLM-structured clinical features into survival prediction models significantly improved accuracy, with the C-index of deep learning models increasing from 0.737 to 0.820. These models also became more interpretable by emphasizing clinically significant factors. This study shows that general-domain LLMs, even without specific medical training, can effectively structure large-scale unstructured EHR data, substantially enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of clinical predictive models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models for molecules have shown considerable promise for use in computational chemistry, but remain difficult to use for non-experts. For this reason, we introduce open-source infrastructure for easily building generative molecular models into the widely used DeepChem [Ramsundar et al., 2019] library with the aim of creating a robust and reusable molecular generation pipeline. In particular, we add high quality PyTorch [Paszke et al., 2019] implementations of the Molecular Generative Adversarial Networks (MolGAN) [Cao and Kipf, 2022] and Normalizing Flows [Papamakarios et al., 2021]. Our implementations show strong performance comparable with past work [Kuznetsov and Polykovskiy, 2021, Cao and Kipf, 2022].</description>

      <title>Heavy-Ball Momentum Accelerated Actor-Critic With Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using an parametric value function to replace the Monte-Carlo rollouts for value estimation, the actor-critic (AC) algorithms can reduce the variance of stochastic policy gradient so that to improve the convergence rate. While existing works mainly focus on analyzing convergence rate of AC algorithms under Markovian noise, the impacts of momentum on AC algorithms remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first propose a heavy-ball momentum based advantage actor-critic (\mbox{HB-A2C}) algorithm by integrating the heavy-ball momentum into the critic recursion that is parameterized by a linear function. When the sample trajectory follows a Markov decision process, we quantitatively certify the acceleration capability of the proposed HB-A2C algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the proposed HB-A2C finds an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point with $\oo{\epsilon^{-2}}$ iterations for reinforcement learning tasks with Markovian noise. Moreover, we also reveal the dependence of learning rates on the length of the sample trajectory. By carefully selecting the momentum factor of the critic recursion, the proposed HB-A2C can balance the errors introduced by the initialization and the stoschastic approximation.</description>

      <title>MathBridge: A Large Corpus Dataset for Translating Spoken Mathematical Expressions into $LaTeX$ Formulas for Improved Readability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the readability of mathematical expressions in text-based document such as subtitle of mathematical video, is an significant task. To achieve this, mathematical expressions should be convert to compiled formulas. For instance, the spoken expression ``x equals minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus four a c, all over two a'' from automatic speech recognition is more readily comprehensible when displayed as a compiled formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. To convert mathematical spoken sentences to compiled formulas, two processes are required: spoken sentences are converted into LaTeX formulas, and LaTeX formulas are converted into compiled formulas. The latter can be managed by using LaTeX engines. However, there is no way to do the former effectively. Even if we try to solve this using language models, there is no paired data between spoken sentences and LaTeX formulas to train it. In this paper, we introduce MathBridge, the first extensive dataset for translating mathematical spoken sentences into LaTeX formulas. MathBridge comprises approximately 23 million LaTeX formulas paired with the corresponding mathematical spoken sentences. Through comprehensive evaluations, including fine-tuning with proposed data, we discovered that MathBridge significantly enhances the capabilities of pretrained language models for converting to LaTeX formulas from mathematical spoken sentences. Specifically, for the T5-large model, the sacreBLEU score increased from 4.77 to 46.8, demonstrating substantial enhancement.</description>

      <title>A System for Automated Unit Test Generation Using Large Language Models and Assessment of Generated Test Suites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unit tests represent the most basic level of testing within the software testing lifecycle and are crucial to ensuring software correctness. Designing and creating unit tests is a costly and labor-intensive process that is ripe for automation. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to various aspects of software development, including unit test generation. Although several empirical studies evaluating LLMs' capabilities in test code generation exist, they primarily focus on simple scenarios, such as the straightforward generation of unit tests for individual methods. These evaluations often involve independent and small-scale test units, providing a limited view of LLMs' performance in real-world software development scenarios. Moreover, previous studies do not approach the problem at a suitable scale for real-life applications. Generated unit tests are often evaluated via manual integration into the original projects, a process that limits the number of tests executed and reduces overall efficiency. To address these gaps, we have developed an approach for generating and evaluating more real-life complexity test suites. Our approach focuses on class-level test code generation and automates the entire process from test generation to test assessment. In this work, we present AgoneTest: an automated system for generating test suites for Java projects and a comprehensive and principled methodology for evaluating the generated test suites. Starting from a state-of-the-art dataset (i.e., Methods2Test), we built a new dataset for comparing human-written tests with those generated by LLMs. Our key contributions include a scalable automated software system, a new dataset, and a detailed methodology for evaluating test quality.</description>

      <title>MAG-SQL: Multi-Agent Generative Approach with Soft Schema Linking and Iterative Sub-SQL Refinement for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent In-Context Learning based methods have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-SQL task. However, there is still a large gap between the performance of these models and human performance on datasets with complex database schema and difficult questions, such as BIRD. Besides, existing work has neglected to supervise intermediate steps when solving questions iteratively with question decomposition methods, and the schema linking methods used in these works are very rudimentary. To address these issues, we propose MAG-SQL, a multi-agent generative approach with soft schema linking and iterative Sub-SQL refinement. In our framework, an entity-based method with tables' summary is used to select the columns in database, and a novel targets-conditions decomposition method is introduced to decompose those complex questions. Additionally, we build a iterative generating module which includes a Sub-SQL Generator and Sub-SQL Refiner, introducing external oversight for each step of generation. Through a series of ablation studies, the effectiveness of each agent in our framework has been demonstrated. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with GPT-4, MAG-SQL achieves an execution accuracy of 61.08%, compared to the baseline accuracy of 46.35% for vanilla GPT-4 and the baseline accuracy of 57.56% for MAC-SQL. Besides, our approach makes similar progress on Spider.</description>

      <title>OC3D: Weakly Supervised Outdoor 3D Object Detection with Only Coarse Click Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based outdoor 3D object detection has received widespread attention. However, training 3D detectors from the LiDAR point cloud typically relies on expensive bounding box annotations. This paper presents OC3D, an innovative weakly supervised method requiring only coarse clicks on the bird's eye view of the 3D point cloud. A key challenge here is the absence of complete geometric descriptions of the target objects from such simple click annotations. To address this problem, our proposed OC3D adopts a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, we initially design a novel dynamic and static classification strategy and then propose the Click2Box and Click2Mask modules to generate box-level and mask-level pseudo-labels for static and dynamic instances, respectively. In the second stage, we design a Mask2Box module, leveraging the learning capabilities of neural networks to update mask-level pseudo-labels, which contain less information, to box-level pseudo-labels. Experimental results on the widely used KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our OC3D with only coarse clicks achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly-supervised 3D detection methods. Combining OC3D with a missing click mining strategy, we propose an OC3D++ pipeline, which requires only 0.2% annotation cost in the KITTI dataset to achieve performance comparable to fully supervised methods. The code will be made publicly available.</description>
