      <title>Attributing Responsibility in AI-Induced Incidents: A Computational Reflective Equilibrium Framework for Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced complex challenges in the responsibility and accountability in the event of incidents involving AI-enabled systems. The interconnectivity of these systems, ethical concerns of AI-induced incidents, coupled with uncertainties in AI technology and the absence of corresponding regulations, have made traditional responsibility attribution challenging. To this end, this work proposes a Computational Reflective Equilibrium (CRE) approach to establish a coherent and ethically acceptable responsibility attribution framework for all stakeholders. The computational approach provides a structured analysis that overcomes the limitations of conceptual approaches in dealing with dynamic and multifaceted scenarios, showcasing the framework's explainability, coherence, and adaptivity properties in the responsibility attribution process. We examine the pivotal role of the initial activation level associated with claims in equilibrium computation. Using an AI-assisted medical decision-support system as a case study, we illustrate how different initializations lead to diverse responsibility distributions. The framework offers valuable insights into accountability in AI-induced incidents, facilitating the development of a sustainable and resilient system through continuous monitoring, revision, and reflection.</description>

      <title>Process Mining Embeddings: Learning Vector Representations for Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining offers powerful techniques for discovering, analyzing, and enhancing real-world business processes. In this context, Petri nets provide an expressive means of modeling process behavior. However, directly analyzing and comparing intricate Petri net presents challenges. This study introduces PetriNet2Vec, a novel unsupervised methodology based on Natural Language Processing concepts inspired by Doc2Vec and designed to facilitate the effective comparison, clustering, and classification of process models represented as embedding vectors. These embedding vectors allow us to quantify similarities and relationships between different process models. Our methodology was experimentally validated using the PDC Dataset, featuring 96 diverse Petri net models. We performed cluster analysis, created UMAP visualizations, and trained a decision tree to provide compelling evidence for the capability of PetriNet2Vec to discern meaningful patterns and relationships among process models and their constituent tasks. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrated that PetriNet2Vec was capable of learning the structure of Petri nets, as well as the main properties used to simulate the process models of our dataset. Furthermore, our results showcase the utility of the learned embeddings in two crucial downstream tasks within process mining enhancement: process classification and process retrieval.</description>

      <title>Certified MaxSAT Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the progress in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving over the last decades, maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) has become a viable approach for solving NP-hard optimization problems, but ensuring correctness of MaxSAT solvers has remained an important concern. For SAT, this is largely a solved problem thanks to the use of proof logging, meaning that solvers emit machine-verifiable proofs of (un)satisfiability to certify correctness. However, for MaxSAT, proof logging solvers have started being developed only very recently. Moreover, these nascent efforts have only targeted the core solving process, ignoring the preprocessing phase where input problem instances can be substantially reformulated before being passed on to the solver proper. In this work, we demonstrate how pseudo-Boolean proof logging can be used to certify the correctness of a wide range of modern MaxSAT preprocessing techniques. By combining and extending the VeriPB and CakePB tools, we provide formally verified, end-to-end proof checking that the input and preprocessed output MaxSAT problem instances have the same optimal value. An extensive evaluation on applied MaxSAT benchmarks shows that our approach is feasible in practice.</description>

      <title>On the Use of Large Language Models to Generate Capability Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17524v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capability ontologies are increasingly used to model functionalities of systems or machines. The creation of such ontological models with all properties and constraints of capabilities is very complex and can only be done by ontology experts. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that they can generate machine-interpretable models from natural language text input and thus support engineers / ontology experts. Therefore, this paper investigates how LLMs can be used to create capability ontologies. We present a study with a series of experiments in which capabilities with varying complexities are generated using different prompting techniques and with different LLMs. Errors in the generated ontologies are recorded and compared. To analyze the quality of the generated ontologies, a semi-automated approach based on RDF syntax checking, OWL reasoning, and SHACL constraints is used. The results of this study are very promising because even for complex capabilities, the generated ontologies are almost free of errors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The agricultural sector plays an essential role in the economic growth of a country. Specifically, in an Indian context, it is the critical source of livelihood for millions of people living in rural areas. Plant Disease is one of the significant factors affecting the agricultural sector. Plants get infected with diseases for various reasons, including synthetic fertilizers, archaic practices, environmental conditions, etc., which impact the farm yield and subsequently hinder the economy. To address this issue, researchers have explored many applications based on AI and Machine Learning techniques to detect plant diseases. This research survey provides a comprehensive understanding of common plant leaf diseases, evaluates traditional and deep learning techniques for disease detection, and summarizes available datasets. It also explores Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance the interpretability of deep learning models' decisions for end-users. By consolidating this knowledge, the survey offers valuable insights to researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders in the agricultural sector, fostering the development of efficient and transparent solutions for combating plant diseases and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</description>

      <title>Biometrics Employing Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biometrics involves using unique human traits, both physical and behavioral, for the digital identification of individuals to provide access to systems, devices, or information. Within the field of computer science, it acts as a method for identifying and verifying individuals and controlling access. While the conventional method for personal authentication involves passwords, the vulnerability arises when passwords are compromised, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive actions. Biometric authentication presents a viable answer to this problem and is the most secure and user-friendly authentication method. Today, fingerprints, iris and retina patterns, facial recognition, hand shapes, palm prints, and voice recognition are frequently used forms of biometrics. Despite the diverse nature of these biometric identifiers, the core objective remains consistent ensuring security, recognizing authorized users, and rejecting impostors. Hence, it is crucial to determine accurately whether the characteristics belong to the rightful person. For systems to be effective and widely accepted, the error rate in recognition and verification must approach zero. It is acknowledged that current biometric techniques, while advanced, are not infallible and require continuous improvement. A more refined classifier is deemed necessary to classify patterns accurately. Artificial Neural Networks, which simulate the human brain's operations, present themselves as a promising approach. The survey presented herein explores various biometric techniques based on neural networks, emphasizing the ongoing quest for enhanced accuracy and reliability. It concludes that The utilization of neural networks along with biometric features not only enhances accuracy but also contributes to overall better security.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Approaches to Enhancing Privacy Preservation of Machine Learning Datasets: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolving landscape of machine learning (ML) and its profound impact across various sectors, with a special focus on the emerging field of Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML). As ML applications become increasingly integral to industries like telecommunications, financial technology, and surveillance, they raise significant privacy concerns, necessitating the development of PPML strategies. The paper highlights the unique challenges in safeguarding privacy within ML frameworks, which stem from the diverse capabilities of potential adversaries, including their ability to infer sensitive information from model outputs or training data.
  We delve into the spectrum of threat models that characterize adversarial intentions, ranging from membership and attribute inference to data reconstruction. The paper emphasizes the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of training data, outlining current research efforts that focus on refining training data to minimize privacy-sensitive information and enhancing data processing techniques to uphold privacy.
  Through a comprehensive analysis of privacy leakage risks and countermeasures in both centralized and collaborative learning settings, this paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of effective strategies for protecting ML training data against privacy intrusions. It explores the balance between data privacy and model utility, shedding light on privacy-preserving techniques that leverage cryptographic methods, Differential Privacy, and Trusted Execution Environments. The discussion extends to the application of these techniques in sensitive domains, underscoring the critical role of PPML in ensuring the privacy and security of ML systems.</description>

      <title>A Disease Labeler for Chinese Chest X-Ray Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of medical image analysis, the scarcity of Chinese chest X-ray report datasets has hindered the development of technology for generating Chinese chest X-ray reports. On one hand, the construction of a Chinese chest X-ray report dataset is limited by the time-consuming and costly process of accurate expert disease annotation. On the other hand, a single natural language generation metric is commonly used to evaluate the similarity between generated and ground-truth reports, while the clinical accuracy and effectiveness of the generated reports rely on an accurate disease labeler (classifier). To address the issues, this study proposes a disease labeler tailored for the generation of Chinese chest X-ray reports. This labeler leverages a dual BERT architecture to handle diagnostic reports and clinical information separately and constructs a hierarchical label learning algorithm based on the affiliation between diseases and body parts to enhance text classification performance. Utilizing this disease labeler, a Chinese chest X-ray report dataset comprising 51,262 report samples was established. Finally, experiments and analyses were conducted on a subset of expert-annotated Chinese chest X-ray reports, validating the effectiveness of the proposed disease labeler.</description>

      <title>Functional Protein Design with Local Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation (PAAG), a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a nearly sixfold increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 8.7% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model.</description>

      <title>LEMDA: A Novel Feature Engineering Method for Intrusion Detection in IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems can use AI-based models to ensure secure communications. IoT systems tend to have many connected devices producing massive amounts of data with high dimensionality, which requires complex models. Complex models have notorious problems such as overfitting, low interpretability, and high computational complexity. Adding model complexity penalty (i.e., regularization) can ease overfitting, but it barely helps interpretability and computational efficiency. Feature engineering can solve these issues; hence, it has become critical for IDS in large-scale IoT systems to reduce the size and dimensionality of data, resulting in less complex models with excellent performance, smaller data storage, and fast detection. This paper proposes a new feature engineering method called LEMDA (Light feature Engineering based on the Mean Decrease in Accuracy). LEMDA applies exponential decay and an optional sensitivity factor to select and create the most informative features. The proposed method has been evaluated and compared to other feature engineering methods using three IoT datasets and four AI/ML models. The results show that LEMDA improves the F1 score performance of all the IDS models by an average of 34% and reduces the average training and detection times in most cases.</description>

      <title>AdvPrompter: Fast Adaptive Adversarial Prompting for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes, they are vulnerable to certain jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires finding adversarial prompts that cause such jailbreaking, e.g. by appending a suffix to a given instruction, which is inefficient and time-consuming. On the other hand, automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that can easily be detected by perplexity-based filters, may require gradient information from the TargetLLM, or do not scale well due to time-consuming discrete optimization processes over the token space. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called the AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds, $\sim800\times$ faster than existing optimization-based approaches. We train the AdvPrompter using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the TargetLLM. This process alternates between two steps: (1) generating high-quality target adversarial suffixes by optimizing the AdvPrompter predictions, and (2) low-rank fine-tuning of the AdvPrompter with the generated adversarial suffixes. The trained AdvPrompter generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs. Further, we demonstrate that by fine-tuning on a synthetic dataset generated by AdvPrompter, LLMs can be made more robust against jailbreaking attacks while maintaining performance, i.e. high MMLU scores.</description>

      <title>AdaQAT: Adaptive Bit-Width Quantization-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in many application scenarios. However, high computational complexity and energy costs of modern DNNs make their deployment on edge devices challenging. Model quantization is a common approach to deal with deployment constraints, but searching for optimized bit-widths can be challenging. In this work, we present Adaptive Bit-Width Quantization Aware Training (AdaQAT), a learning-based method that automatically optimizes weight and activation signal bit-widths during training for more efficient DNN inference. We use relaxed real-valued bit-widths that are updated using a gradient descent rule, but are otherwise discretized for all quantization operations. The result is a simple and flexible QAT approach for mixed-precision uniform quantization problems. Compared to other methods that are generally designed to be run on a pretrained network, AdaQAT works well in both training from scratch and fine-tuning scenarios.Initial results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using ResNet20 and ResNet18 models, respectively, indicate that our method is competitive with other state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization approaches.</description>

      <title>Rapid Deployment of DNNs for Edge Computing via Structured Pruning at Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge machine learning (ML) enables localized processing of data on devices and is underpinned by deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs cannot be easily run on devices due to their substantial computing, memory and energy requirements for delivering performance that is comparable to cloud-based ML. Therefore, model compression techniques, such as pruning, have been considered. Existing pruning methods are problematic for edge ML since they: (1) Create compressed models that have limited runtime performance benefits (using unstructured pruning) or compromise the final model accuracy (using structured pruning), and (2) Require substantial compute resources and time for identifying a suitable compressed DNN model (using neural architecture search). In this paper, we explore a new avenue, referred to as Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI), using structured pruning to mitigate the above problems. We develop Reconvene, a system for rapidly generating pruned models suited for edge deployments using structured PaI. Reconvene systematically identifies and prunes DNN convolution layers that are least sensitive to structured pruning. Reconvene rapidly creates pruned DNNs within seconds that are up to 16.21x smaller and 2x faster while maintaining the same accuracy as an unstructured PaI counterpart.</description>

      <title>Learning Control Barrier Functions and their application in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique for developing new robot behaviors. However, typical lack of safety guarantees constitutes a hurdle for its practical application on real robots. To address this issue, safe reinforcement learning aims to incorporate safety considerations, enabling faster transfer to real robots and facilitating lifelong learning. One promising approach within safe reinforcement learning is the use of control barrier functions. These functions provide a framework to ensure that the system remains in a safe state during the learning process. However, synthesizing control barrier functions is not straightforward and often requires ample domain knowledge. This challenge motivates the exploration of data-driven methods for automatically defining control barrier functions, which is highly appealing. We conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature on safe reinforcement learning using control barrier functions. Additionally, we investigate various techniques for automatically learning the Control Barrier Functions, aiming to enhance the safety and efficacy of Reinforcement Learning in practical robot applications.</description>

Abstract: Molecule-and-text cross-modal representation learning has emerged as a promising direction for enhancing the quality of molecular representation, thereby improving performance in various scientific fields, including drug discovery and materials science. Existing studies adopt a global alignment approach to learn the knowledge from different modalities. These global alignment approaches fail to capture fine-grained information, such as molecular fragments and their corresponding textual description, which is crucial for downstream tasks. Furthermore, it is incapable to model such information using a similar global alignment strategy due to data scarcity of paired local part annotated data from existing datasets. In this paper, we propose Atomas, a multi-modal molecular representation learning framework to jointly learn representations from SMILES string and text. We design a Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model to concurrently learn the fine-grained fragment correspondence between two modalities and align these representations of fragments in three levels. Additionally, Atomas's end-to-end training framework incorporates the tasks of understanding and generating molecule, thereby supporting a wider range of downstream tasks. In the retrieval task, Atomas exhibits robust generalization ability and outperforms the baseline by 30.8% of recall@1 on average. In the generation task, Atomas achieves state-of-the-art results in both molecule captioning task and molecule generation task. Moreover, the visualization of the Hierarchical Adaptive Alignment model further confirms the chemical significance of our approach.

      <title>Aligning Knowledge Graphs Provided by Humans and Generated from Neural Networks in Specific Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an innovative method that enables neural networks to generate and utilize knowledge graphs, which describe their concept-level knowledge and optimize network parameters through alignment with human-provided knowledge. This research addresses a gap where traditionally, network-generated knowledge has been limited to applications in downstream symbolic analysis or enhancing network transparency. By integrating a novel autoencoder design with the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA), we have introduced auxiliary tasks that support end-to-end training. Our approach eschews traditional dependencies on ontologies or word embedding models, mining concepts from neural networks and directly aligning them with human knowledge. Experiments show that our method consistently captures network-generated concepts that align closely with human knowledge and can even uncover new, useful concepts not previously identified by humans. This plug-and-play strategy not only enhances the interpretability of neural networks but also facilitates the integration of symbolic logical reasoning within these systems.</description>

      <title>Adapting an Artificial Intelligence Sexually Transmitted Diseases Symptom Checker Tool for Mpox Detection: The HeHealth Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence applications have shown promise in the management of pandemics and have been widely used to assist the identification, classification, and diagnosis of medical images. In response to the global outbreak of Monkeypox (Mpox), the HeHealth.ai team leveraged an existing tool to screen for sexually transmitted diseases to develop a digital screening test for symptomatic Mpox through AI approaches. Prior to the global outbreak of Mpox, the team developed a smartphone app, where app users can use their own smartphone cameras to take pictures of their own penises to screen for symptomatic STD. The AI model was initially developed using 5000 cases and use a modified convolutional neural network to output prediction scores across visually diagnosable penis pathologies including Syphilis, Herpes Simplex Virus, and Human Papilloma Virus. From June 2022 to October 2022, a total of about 22,000 users downloaded the HeHealth app, and about 21,000 images have been analyzed using HeHealth AI technology. We then engaged in formative research, stakeholder engagement, rapid consolidation images, a validation study, and implementation of the tool from July 2022. From July 2022 to October 2022, a total of 1000 Mpox related images had been used to train the Mpox symptom checker tool. Our digital symptom checker tool showed accuracy of 87% to rule in Mpox and 90% to rule out symptomatic Mpox. Several hurdles identified included issues of data privacy and security for app users, initial lack of data to train the AI tool, and the potential generalizability of input data. We offer several suggestions to help others get started on similar projects in emergency situations, including engaging a wide range of stakeholders, having a multidisciplinary team, prioritizing pragmatism, as well as the concept that big data in fact is made up of small data.</description>

      <title>Review of Data-centric Time Series Analysis from Sample, Feature, and Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is essential to performing time series analysis utilizing machine learning approaches, whether for classic models or today's large language models. A good time-series dataset is advantageous for the model's accuracy, robustness, and convergence, as well as task outcomes and costs. The emergence of data-centric AI represents a shift in the landscape from model refinement to prioritizing data quality. Even though time-series data processing methods frequently come up in a wide range of research fields, it hasn't been well investigated as a specific topic. To fill the gap, in this paper, we systematically review different data-centric methods in time series analysis, covering a wide range of research topics. Based on the time-series data characteristics at sample, feature, and period, we propose a taxonomy for the reviewed data selection methods. In addition to discussing and summarizing their characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks targeting time-series data, we also introduce the challenges and opportunities by proposing recommendations, open problems, and possible research topics.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection for Incident Response at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning-based anomaly detection product, AI Detect and Respond (AIDR), that monitors Walmart's business and system health in real-time. During the validation over 3 months, the product served predictions from over 3000 models to more than 25 application, platform, and operation teams, covering 63\% of major incidents and reducing the mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) by more than 7 minutes. Unlike previous anomaly detection methods, our solution leverages statistical, ML and deep learning models while continuing to incorporate rule-based static thresholds to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. Both univariate and multivariate ML models are deployed and maintained through distributed services for scalability and high availability. AIDR has a feedback loop that assesses model quality with a combination of drift detection algorithms and customer feedback. It also offers self-onboarding capabilities and customizability. AIDR has achieved success with various internal teams with lower time to detection and fewer false positives than previous methods. As we move forward, we aim to expand incident coverage and prevention, reduce noise, and integrate further with root cause recommendation (RCR) to enable an end-to-end AIDR experience.</description>

      <title>NEPENTHE: Entropy-Based Pruning as a Neural Network Depth's Reducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep neural networks are highly effective at solving complex tasks, their computational demands can hinder their usefulness in real-time applications and with limited-resources systems. Besides, for many tasks it is known that these models are over-parametrized: neoteric works have broadly focused on reducing the width of these networks, rather than their depth. In this paper, we aim to reduce the depth of over-parametrized deep neural networks: we propose an eNtropy-basEd Pruning as a nEural Network depTH's rEducer (NEPENTHE) to alleviate deep neural networks' computational burden. Based on our theoretical finding, NEPENTHE focuses on un-structurally pruning connections in layers with low entropy to remove them entirely. We validate our approach on popular architectures such as MobileNet and Swin-T, showing that when encountering an over-parametrization regime, it can effectively linearize some layers (hence reducing the model's depth) with little to no performance loss. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the article.</description>

      <title>Attacks on Third-Party APIs of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services have recently begun offering a plugin ecosystem to interact with third-party API services. This innovation enhances the capabilities of LLMs, but it also introduces risks, as these plugins developed by various third parties cannot be easily trusted. This paper proposes a new attacking framework to examine security and safety vulnerabilities within LLM platforms that incorporate third-party services. Applying our framework specifically to widely used LLMs, we identify real-world malicious attacks across various domains on third-party APIs that can imperceptibly modify LLM outputs. The paper discusses the unique challenges posed by third-party API integration and offers strategic possibilities to improve the security and safety of LLM ecosystems moving forward. Our code is released at https://github.com/vk0812/Third-Party-Attacks-on-LLMs.</description>

      <title>Automatic AI controller that can drive with confidence: steering vehicle with uncertainty knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical systems that interface with the real world, the role of uncertainty in decision-making is pivotal, particularly in the context of machine learning models. For the secure functioning of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), it is imperative to manage such uncertainty adeptly. In this research, we focus on the development of a vehicle's lateral control system using a machine learning framework. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), a probabilistic learning model, to address uncertainty quantification. This capability allows us to gauge the level of confidence or uncertainty in the model's predictions. The BNN based controller is trained using simulated data gathered from the vehicle traversing a single track and subsequently tested on various other tracks. We want to share two significant results: firstly, the trained model demonstrates the ability to adapt and effectively control the vehicle on multiple similar tracks. Secondly, the quantification of prediction confidence integrated into the controller serves as an early-warning system, signaling when the algorithm lacks confidence in its predictions and is therefore susceptible to failure. By establishing a confidence threshold, we can trigger manual intervention, ensuring that control is relinquished from the algorithm when it operates outside of safe parameters.</description>

      <title>On TinyML and Cybersecurity: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As technology advances, the use of Machine Learning (ML) in cybersecurity is becoming increasingly crucial to tackle the growing complexity of cyber threats. While traditional ML models can enhance cybersecurity, their high energy and resource demands limit their applications, leading to the emergence of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) as a more suitable solution for resource-constrained environments. TinyML is widely applied in areas such as smart homes, healthcare, and industrial automation. TinyML focuses on optimizing ML algorithms for small, low-power devices, enabling intelligent data processing directly on edge devices. This paper provides a comprehensive review of common challenges of TinyML techniques, such as power consumption, limited memory, and computational constraints; it also explores potential solutions to these challenges, such as energy harvesting, computational optimization techniques, and transfer learning for privacy preservation. On the other hand, this paper discusses TinyML's applications in advancing cybersecurity for Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructures (EVCIs) as a representative use case. It presents an experimental case study that enhances cybersecurity in EVCI using TinyML, evaluated against traditional ML in terms of reduced delay and memory usage, with a slight trade-off in accuracy. Additionally, the study includes a practical setup using the ESP32 microcontroller in the PlatformIO environment, which provides a hands-on assessment of TinyML's application in cybersecurity for EVCI.</description>

      <title>Exploring Learngene via Stage-wise Weight Sharing for Initializing Variable-sized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practice, we usually need to build variable-sized models adapting for diverse resource constraints in different application scenarios, where weight initialization is an important step prior to training. The Learngene framework, introduced recently, firstly learns one compact part termed as learngene from a large well-trained model, after which learngene is expanded to initialize variable-sized models. In this paper, we start from analysing the importance of guidance for the expansion of well-trained learngene layers, inspiring the design of a simple but highly effective Learngene approach termed SWS (Stage-wise Weight Sharing), where both learngene layers and their learning process critically contribute to providing knowledge and guidance for initializing models at varying scales. Specifically, to learn learngene layers, we build an auxiliary model comprising multiple stages where the layer weights in each stage are shared, after which we train it through distillation. Subsequently, we expand these learngene layers containing stage information at their corresponding stage to initialize models of variable depths. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that SWS achieves consistent better performance compared to many models trained from scratch, while reducing around 6.6x total training costs. In some cases, SWS performs better only after 1 epoch tuning. When initializing variable-sized models adapting for different resource constraints, SWS achieves better results while reducing around 20x parameters stored to initialize these models and around 10x pre-training costs, in contrast to the pre-training and fine-tuning approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates three different parameterizations of asymmetric uniform quantization for quantization-aware training: (1) scale and offset, (2) minimum and maximum, and (3) beta and gamma. We perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of these parameterizations' influence on quantization-aware training, using both controlled experiments and real-world large language models. Our particular focus is on their changing behavior in response to critical training hyperparameters, bit width and learning rate. Based on our investigation, we propose best practices to stabilize and accelerate quantization-aware training with learnable asymmetric quantization ranges.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence algorithms have now become pervasive in multiple high-stakes domains. However, their internal logic can be obscure to humans. Explainable Artificial Intelligence aims to design tools and techniques to illustrate the predictions of the so-called black-box algorithms. The Human-Computer Interaction community has long stressed the need for a more user-centered approach to Explainable AI. This approach can benefit from research in user interface, user experience, and visual analytics. This paper proposes a visual-based method to illustrate rules paired with feature importance. A user study with 15 participants was conducted comparing our visual method with the original output of the algorithm and textual representation to test its effectiveness with users.</description>

      <title>Evolve Cost-aware Acquisition Functions Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization scenarios involve expensive evaluation with unknown and heterogeneous costs. Cost-aware Bayesian optimization stands out as a prominent solution in addressing these challenges. To approach the global optimum within a limited budget in a cost-efficient manner, the design of cost-aware acquisition functions (AFs) becomes a crucial step. However, traditional manual design paradigm typically requires extensive domain knowledge and involves a labor-intensive trial-and-error process. This paper introduces EvolCAF, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) to automatically design cost-aware AFs. Leveraging the crossover and mutation in the algorithm space, EvolCAF offers a novel design paradigm, significantly reduces the reliance on domain expertise and model training. The designed cost-aware AF maximizes the utilization of available information from historical data, surrogate models and budget details. It introduces novel ideas not previously explored in the existing literature on acquisition function design, allowing for clear interpretations to provide insights into its behavior and decision-making process. In comparison to the well-known EIpu and EI-cool methods designed by human experts, our approach showcases remarkable efficiency and generalization across various tasks, including 12 synthetic problems and 3 real-world hyperparameter tuning test sets.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap: Optimizing Guidance and Control Networks through Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve the accuracy of Guidance &amp; Control Networks (G&amp;CNETs), trained to represent the optimal control policies of a time-optimal transfer and a mass-optimal landing, respectively. In both cases we leverage the dynamics of the spacecraft, described by Ordinary Differential Equations which incorporate a neural network on their right-hand side (Neural ODEs). Since the neural dynamics is differentiable, the ODEs sensitivities to the network parameters can be computed using the variational equations, thereby allowing to update the G&amp;CNET parameters based on the observed dynamics. We start with a straightforward regression task, training the G&amp;CNETs on datasets of optimal trajectories using behavioural cloning. These networks are then refined using the Neural ODE sensitivities by minimizing the error between the final states and the target states. We demonstrate that for the orbital transfer, the final error to the target can be reduced by 99% on a single trajectory and by 70% on a batch of 500 trajectories. For the landing problem the reduction in error is around 98-99% (position) and 40-44% (velocity). This step significantly enhances the accuracy of G&amp;CNETs, which instills greater confidence in their reliability for operational use. We also compare our results to the popular Dataset Aggregation method (DaGGER) and allude to the strengths and weaknesses of both methods.</description>

      <title>DE-CGAN: Boosting rTMS Treatment Prediction with Diversity Enhancing Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a well-supported, evidence-based treatment for depression. However, patterns of response to this treatment are inconsistent. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence can predict rTMS treatment outcomes for most patients using fMRI connectivity features. While these models can reliably predict treatment outcomes for many patients for some underrepresented fMRI connectivity measures DNN models are unable to reliably predict treatment outcomes. As such we propose a novel method, Diversity Enhancing Conditional General Adversarial Network (DE-CGAN) for oversampling these underrepresented examples. DE-CGAN creates synthetic examples in difficult-to-classify regions by first identifying these data points and then creating conditioned synthetic examples to enhance data diversity. Through empirical experiments we show that a classification model trained using a diversity enhanced training set outperforms traditional data augmentation techniques and existing benchmark results. This work shows that increasing the diversity of a training dataset can improve classification model performance. Furthermore, this work provides evidence for the utility of synthetic patients providing larger more robust datasets for both AI researchers and psychiatrists to explore variable relationships.</description>

      <title>Prediction Is All MoE Needs: Expert Load Distribution Goes from Fluctuating to Stabilizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MoE facilitates the development of large models by making the computational complexity of the model no longer scale linearly with increasing parameters. The learning sparse gating network selects a set of experts for each token to be processed; however, this may lead to differences in the number of tokens processed by each expert over several successive iterations, i.e., the expert load fluctuations, which reduces computational parallelization and resource utilization. To this end, we traced and analyzed loads of each expert in the training iterations for several large language models in this work, and defined the transient state with "obvious load fluctuation" and the stable state with "temporal locality". Moreover, given the characteristics of these two states and the computational overhead, we deployed three classical prediction algorithms that achieve accurate expert load prediction results. For the GPT3 350M model, the average error rates for predicting the expert load proportion over the next 1,000 and 2,000 steps are approximately 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. This work can provide valuable guidance for expert placement or resource allocation for MoE model training. Based on this work, we will propose an expert placement scheme for transient and stable states in our coming work.</description>

      <title>Grad Queue : A probabilistic framework to reinforce sparse gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informative gradients are often lost in large batch updates. We propose a robust mechanism to reinforce the sparse components within a random batch of data points. A finite queue of online gradients is used to determine their expected instantaneous statistics. We propose a function to measure the scarcity of incoming gradients using these statistics and establish the theoretical ground of this mechanism. To minimize conflicting components within large mini-batches, samples are grouped with aligned objectives by clustering based on inherent feature space. Sparsity is measured for each centroid and weighted accordingly. A strong intuitive criterion to squeeze out redundant information from each cluster is the backbone of the system. It makes rare information indifferent to aggressive momentum also exhibits superior performance with larger mini-batch horizon. The effective length of the queue kept variable to follow the local loss pattern. The contribution of our method is to restore intra-mini-batch diversity at the same time widening the optimal batch boundary. Both of these collectively drive it deeper towards the minima. Our method has shown superior performance for CIFAR10, MNIST, and Reuters News category dataset compared to mini-batch gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Taming False Positives in Out-of-Distribution Detection with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback to \emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5\%$ while maximizing TPR.</description>

      <title>IDIL: Imitation Learning of Intent-Driven Expert Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When faced with accomplishing a task, human experts exhibit intentional behavior. Their unique intents shape their plans and decisions, resulting in experts demonstrating diverse behaviors to accomplish the same task. Due to the uncertainties encountered in the real world and their bounded rationality, experts sometimes adjust their intents, which in turn influences their behaviors during task execution. This paper introduces IDIL, a novel imitation learning algorithm to mimic these diverse intent-driven behaviors of experts. Iteratively, our approach estimates expert intent from heterogeneous demonstrations and then uses it to learn an intent-aware model of their behavior. Unlike contemporary approaches, IDIL is capable of addressing sequential tasks with high-dimensional state representations, while sidestepping the complexities and drawbacks associated with adversarial training (a mainstay of related techniques). Our empirical results suggest that the models generated by IDIL either match or surpass those produced by recent imitation learning benchmarks in metrics of task performance. Moreover, as it creates a generative model, IDIL demonstrates superior performance in intent inference metrics, crucial for human-agent interactions, and aptly captures a broad spectrum of expert behaviors.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Class Membership Relations in Knowledge Graphs using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A backbone of knowledge graphs are their class membership relations, which assign entities to a given class. As part of the knowledge engineering process, we propose a new method for evaluating the quality of these relations by processing descriptions of a given entity and class using a zero-shot chain-of-thought classifier that uses a natural language intensional definition of a class. We evaluate the method using two publicly available knowledge graphs, Wikidata and CaLiGraph, and 7 large language models. Using the gpt-4-0125-preview large language model, the method's classification performance achieves a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.830 on data from Wikidata and 0.893 on data from CaLiGraph. Moreover, a manual analysis of the classification errors shows that 40.9% of errors were due to the knowledge graphs, with 16.0% due to missing relations and 24.9% due to incorrectly asserted relations. These results show how large language models can assist knowledge engineers in the process of knowledge graph refinement. The code and data are available on Github.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The developments that language models have provided in fulfilling almost all kinds of tasks have attracted the attention of not only researchers but also the society and have enabled them to become products. There are commercially successful language models available. However, users may prefer open-source language models due to cost, data privacy, or regulations. Yet, despite the increasing number of these models, there is no comprehensive comparison of their performance for Turkish. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature. A comparison is made among seven selected language models based on their contextual learning and question-answering abilities. Turkish datasets for contextual learning and question-answering were prepared, and both automatic and human evaluations were conducted. The results show that for question-answering, continuing pretraining before fine-tuning with instructional datasets is more successful in adapting multilingual models to Turkish and that in-context learning performances do not much related to question-answering performances.</description>

      <title>Leveraging AI to Generate Audio for User-generated Content in Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In video game design, audio (both environmental background music and object sound effects) play a critical role. Sounds are typically pre-created assets designed for specific locations or objects in a game. However, user-generated content is becoming increasingly popular in modern games (e.g. building custom environments or crafting unique objects). Since the possibilities are virtually limitless, it is impossible for game creators to pre-create audio for user-generated content. We explore the use of generative artificial intelligence to create music and sound effects on-the-fly based on user-generated content. We investigate two avenues for audio generation: 1) text-to-audio: using a text description of user-generated content as input to the audio generator, and 2) image-to-audio: using a rendering of the created environment or object as input to an image-to-text generator, then piping the resulting text description into the audio generator. In this paper we discuss ethical implications of using generative artificial intelligence for user-generated content and highlight two prototype games where audio is generated for user-created environments and objects.</description>

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) models excel in computer vision tasks but can be susceptible to adversarial examples. This paper introduces Triple-Metric EvoAttack (TM-EVO), an efficient algorithm for evaluating the robustness of object-detection DL models against adversarial attacks. TM-EVO utilizes a multi-metric fitness function to guide an evolutionary search efficiently in creating effective adversarial test inputs with minimal perturbations. We evaluate TM-EVO on widely-used object-detection DL models, DETR and Faster R-CNN, and open-source datasets, COCO and KITTI. Our findings reveal that TM-EVO outperforms the state-of-the-art EvoAttack baseline, leading to adversarial tests with less noise while maintaining efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We explore how interaction with large language models (LLMs) can give rise to emergent behaviors, empowering players to participate in the evolution of game narratives. Our testbed is a text-adventure game in which players attempt to solve a mystery under a fixed narrative premise, but can freely interact with non-player characters generated by GPT-4, a large language model. We recruit 28 gamers to play the game and use GPT-4 to automatically convert the game logs into a node-graph representing the narrative in the player's gameplay. We find that through their interactions with the non-deterministic behavior of the LLM, players are able to discover interesting new emergent nodes that were not a part of the original narrative but have potential for being fun and engaging. Players that created the most emergent nodes tended to be those that often enjoy games that facilitate discovery, exploration and experimentation.</description>

      <title>Generative AI in Color-Changing Systems: Re-Programmable 3D Object Textures with Material and Design Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in Generative AI tools have allowed designers to manipulate existing 3D models using text or image-based prompts, enabling creators to explore different design goals. Photochromic color-changing systems, on the other hand, allow for the reprogramming of surface texture of 3D models, enabling easy customization of physical objects and opening up the possibility of using object surfaces for data display. However, existing photochromic systems require the user to manually design the desired texture, inspect the simulation of the pattern on the object, and verify the efficacy of the generated pattern. These manual design, inspection, and verification steps prevent the user from efficiently exploring the design space of possible patterns. Thus, by designing an automated workflow desired for an end-to-end texture application process, we can allow rapid iteration on different practicable patterns.
  In this workshop paper, we discuss the possibilities of extending generative AI systems, with material and design constraints for reprogrammable surfaces with photochromic materials. By constraining generative AI systems to colors and materials possible to be physically realized with photochromic dyes, we can create tools that would allow users to explore different viable patterns, with text and image-based prompts. We identify two focus areas in this topic: photochromic material constraints and design constraints for data-encoded textures. We highlight the current limitations of using generative AI tools to create viable textures using photochromic material. Finally, we present possible approaches to augment generative AI methods to take into account the photochromic material constraints, allowing for the creation of viable photochromic textures rapidly and easily.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Code Clone Dynamics in Deep Learning Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) frameworks play a critical role in advancing artificial intelligence, and their rapid growth underscores the need for a comprehensive understanding of software quality and maintainability. DL frameworks, like other systems, are prone to code clones. Code clones refer to identical or highly similar source code fragments within the same project or even across different projects. Code cloning can have positive and negative implications for software development, influencing maintenance, readability, and bug propagation. In this paper, we aim to address the knowledge gap concerning the evolutionary dimension of code clones in DL frameworks and the extent of code reuse across these frameworks. We empirically analyze code clones in nine popular DL frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, Paddle, PyTorch, Aesara, Ray, MXNet, Keras, Jax and BentoML, to investigate (1) the characteristics of the long-term code cloning evolution over releases in each framework, (2) the short-term, i.e., within-release, code cloning patterns and their influence on the long-term trends, and (3) the file-level code clones within the DL frameworks. Our findings reveal that DL frameworks adopt four distinct cloning trends and that these trends present some common and distinct characteristics. For instance, bug-fixing activities persistently happen in clones irrespective of the clone evolutionary trend but occur more in the "Serpentine" trend. Moreover, the within release level investigation demonstrates that short-term code cloning practices impact long-term cloning trends. The cross-framework code clone investigation reveals the presence of functional and architectural adaptation file-level cross-framework code clones across the nine studied frameworks. We provide insights that foster robust clone practices and collaborative maintenance in the development of DL frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in network diffusion models and related problems. The most popular of these are the independent cascade and linear threshold models. Much of the recent experimental work done on these models requires a large number of simulations conducted on large graphs, a computationally expensive task suited for low-level languages. However, many researchers prefer the use of higher-level languages (such as Python) for their flexibility and shorter development times. Moreover, in many research tasks, these simulations are the most computationally intensive task, so it would be desirable to have a library for these with an interface to a high-level language with the performance of a low-level language. To fill this niche, we introduce CyNetDiff, a Python library with components written in Cython to provide improved performance for these computationally intensive diffusion tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multimodal dataset for Cognitive Load Assessment in REaltime (CLARE). The dataset contains physiological and gaze data from 24 participants with self-reported cognitive load scores as ground-truth labels. The dataset consists of four modalities, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Gaze tracking. To map diverse levels of mental load on participants during experiments, each participant completed four nine-minutes sessions on a computer-based operator performance and mental workload task (the MATB-II software) with varying levels of complexity in one minute segments. During the experiment, participants reported their cognitive load every 10 seconds. For the dataset, we also provide benchmark binary classification results with machine learning and deep learning models on two different evaluation schemes, namely, 10-fold and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. Benchmark results show that for 10-fold evaluation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model achieves the best classification performance with ECG, EDA, and Gaze. In contrast, for LOSO, the best performance is achieved by the deep learning model with ECG, EDA, and EEG.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit excellent ability to understand human languages, but do they also understand their own language that appears gibberish to us? In this work we delve into this question, aiming to uncover the mechanisms underlying such behavior in LLMs. We employ the Greedy Coordinate Gradient optimizer to craft prompts that compel LLMs to generate coherent responses from seemingly nonsensical inputs. We call these inputs LM Babel and this work systematically studies the behavior of LLMs manipulated by these prompts. We find that the manipulation efficiency depends on the target text's length and perplexity, with the Babel prompts often located in lower loss minima compared to natural prompts. We further examine the structure of the Babel prompts and evaluate their robustness. Notably, we find that guiding the model to generate harmful texts is not more difficult than into generating benign texts, suggesting lack of alignment for out-of-distribution prompts.</description>

      <title>2M-NER: Contrastive Learning for Multilingual and Multimodal NER with Language and Modal Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying and classifying entities in sentences into pre-defined types. It plays a crucial role in various research fields, including entity linking, question answering, and online product recommendation. Recent studies have shown that incorporating multilingual and multimodal datasets can enhance the effectiveness of NER. This is due to language transfer learning and the presence of shared implicit features across different modalities. However, the lack of a dataset that combines multilingualism and multimodality has hindered research exploring the combination of these two aspects, as multimodality can help NER in multiple languages simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to address a more challenging task: multilingual and multimodal named entity recognition (MMNER), considering its potential value and influence. Specifically, we construct a large-scale MMNER dataset with four languages (English, French, German and Spanish) and two modalities (text and image). To tackle this challenging MMNER task on the dataset, we introduce a new model called 2M-NER, which aligns the text and image representations using contrastive learning and integrates a multimodal collaboration module to effectively depict the interactions between the two modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the highest F1 score in multilingual and multimodal NER tasks compared to some comparative and representative baselines. Additionally, in a challenging analysis, we discovered that sentence-level alignment interferes a lot with NER models, indicating the higher level of difficulty in our dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel application of an uncertainty-quantification framework called Deep Evidential Learning in the domain of radiotherapy dose prediction. Using medical images of the Open Knowledge-Based Planning Challenge dataset, we found that this model can be effectively harnessed to yield uncertainty estimates that inherited correlations with prediction errors upon completion of network training. This was achieved only after reformulating the original loss function for a stable implementation. We found that (i)epistemic uncertainty was highly correlated with prediction errors, with various association indices comparable or stronger than those for Monte-Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensemble methods, (ii)the median error varied with uncertainty threshold much more linearly for epistemic uncertainty in Deep Evidential Learning relative to these other two conventional frameworks, indicative of a more uniformly calibrated sensitivity to model errors, (iii)relative to epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty demonstrated a more significant shift in its distribution in response to Gaussian noise added to CT intensity, compatible with its interpretation as reflecting data noise. Collectively, our results suggest that Deep Evidential Learning is a promising approach that can endow deep-learning models in radiotherapy dose prediction with statistical robustness. Towards enhancing its clinical relevance, we demonstrate how we can use such a model to construct the predicted Dose-Volume-Histograms' confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) task aims to transform natural-language descriptions into visual representations for a grounded table, enabling users to gain insights from vast amounts of data. Recently, many deep learning-based approaches have been developed for NL2Vis. Despite the considerable efforts made by these approaches, challenges persist in visualizing data sourced from unseen databases or spanning multiple tables. Taking inspiration from the remarkable generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper conducts an empirical study to evaluate their potential in generating visualizations, and explore the effectiveness of in-context learning prompts for enhancing this task. In particular, we first explore the ways of transforming structured tabular data into sequential text prompts, as to feed them into LLMs and analyze which table content contributes most to the NL2Vis. Our findings suggest that transforming structured tabular data into programs is effective, and it is essential to consider the table schema when formulating prompts. Furthermore, we evaluate two types of LLMs: finetuned models (e.g., T5-Small) and inference-only models (e.g., GPT-3.5), against state-of-the-art methods, using the NL2Vis benchmarks (i.e., nvBench). The experimental results reveal that LLMs outperform baselines, with inference-only models consistently exhibiting performance improvements, at times even surpassing fine-tuned models when provided with certain few-shot demonstrations through in-context learning. Finally, we analyze when the LLMs fail in NL2Vis, and propose to iteratively update the results using strategies such as chain-of-thought, role-playing, and code-interpreter. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of iterative updates and hold great potential for future study.</description>

      <title>Exploring Beyond Logits: Hierarchical Dynamic Labeling Based on Embeddings for Semi-Supervised Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semi-supervised learning, methods that rely on confidence learning to generate pseudo-labels have been widely proposed. However, increasing research finds that when faced with noisy and biased data, the model's representation network is more reliable than the classification network. Additionally, label generation methods based on model predictions often show poor adaptability across different datasets, necessitating customization of the classification network. Therefore, we propose a Hierarchical Dynamic Labeling (HDL) algorithm that does not depend on model predictions and utilizes image embeddings to generate sample labels. We also introduce an adaptive method for selecting hyperparameters in HDL, enhancing its versatility. Moreover, HDL can be combined with general image encoders (e.g., CLIP) to serve as a fundamental data processing module. We extract embeddings from datasets with class-balanced and long-tailed distributions using pre-trained semi-supervised models. Subsequently, samples are re-labeled using HDL, and the re-labeled samples are used to further train the semi-supervised models. Experiments demonstrate improved model performance, validating the motivation that representation networks are more reliable than classifiers or predictors. Our approach has the potential to change the paradigm of pseudo-label generation in semi-supervised learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social anxiety represents a prevalent challenge in modern society, affecting individuals across personal and professional spheres. Left unaddressed, this condition can yield substantial negative consequences, impacting social interactions and performance. Further understanding its diverse physical and emotional symptoms becomes pivotal for comprehensive diagnosis and tailored therapeutic interventions. This study analyze prevalence and frequency of social anxiety symptoms taken from Mayo Clinic, exploring diverse human experiences from utilizing a large Reddit dataset dedicated to this issue. Leveraging these platforms, the research aims to extract insights and examine a spectrum of physical and emotional symptoms linked to social anxiety disorder. Upholding ethical considerations, the study maintains strict user anonymity within the dataset. By employing a novel approach, the research utilizes BART-based multi-label zero-shot classification to identify and measure symptom prevalence and significance in the form of probability score for each symptom under consideration. Results uncover distinctive patterns: "Trembling" emerges as a prevalent physical symptom, while emotional symptoms like "Fear of being judged negatively" exhibit high frequencies. These findings offer insights into the multifaceted nature of social anxiety, aiding clinical practices and interventions tailored to its diverse expressions.</description>

      <title>MCSDNet: Mesoscale Convective System Detection Network via Multi-scale Spatiotemporal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate detection of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) is crucial for meteorological monitoring due to their potential to cause significant destruction through severe weather phenomena such as hail, thunderstorms, and heavy rainfall. However, the existing methods for MCS detection mostly targets on single-frame detection, which just considers the static characteristics and ignores the temporal evolution in the life cycle of MCS. In this paper, we propose a novel encoder-decoder neural network for MCS detection(MCSDNet). MCSDNet has a simple architecture and is easy to expand. Different from the previous models, MCSDNet targets on multi-frames detection and leverages multi-scale spatiotemporal information for the detection of MCS regions in remote sensing imagery(RSI). As far as we know, it is the first work to utilize multi-scale spatiotemporal information to detect MCS regions. Firstly, we design a multi-scale spatiotemporal information module to extract multi-level semantic from different encoder levels, which makes our models can extract more detail spatiotemporal features. Secondly, a Spatiotemporal Mix Unit(STMU) is introduced to MCSDNet to capture both intra-frame features and inter-frame correlations, which is a scalable module and can be replaced by other spatiotemporal module, e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer and our proposed Dual Spatiotemporal Attention(DSTA). This means that the future works about spatiotemporal modules can be easily integrated to our model. Finally, we present MCSRSI, the first publicly available dataset for multi-frames MCS detection based on visible channel images from the FY-4A satellite. We also conduct several experiments on MCSRSI and find that our proposed MCSDNet achieve the best performance on MCS detection task when comparing to other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Human-Imperceptible Retrieval Poisoning Attacks in LLM-Powered Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presently, with the assistance of advanced LLM application development frameworks, more and more LLM-powered applications can effortlessly augment the LLMs' knowledge with external content using the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, these frameworks' designs do not have sufficient consideration of the risk of external content, thereby allowing attackers to undermine the applications developed with these frameworks. In this paper, we reveal a new threat to LLM-powered applications, termed retrieval poisoning, where attackers can guide the application to yield malicious responses during the RAG process. Specifically, through the analysis of LLM application frameworks, attackers can craft documents visually indistinguishable from benign ones. Despite the documents providing correct information, once they are used as reference sources for RAG, the application is misled into generating incorrect responses. Our preliminary experiments indicate that attackers can mislead LLMs with an 88.33\% success rate, and achieve a 66.67\% success rate in the real-world application, demonstrating the potential impact of retrieval poisoning.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Privacy and Security of Autonomous UAV Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in defense, law enforcement, disaster response, and product delivery. These autonomous navigation systems require a wireless communication network, and of late are deep learning based. In critical scenarios such as border protection or disaster response, ensuring the secure navigation of autonomous UAVs is paramount. But, these autonomous UAVs are susceptible to adversarial attacks through the communication network or the deep learning models - eavesdropping / man-in-the-middle / membership inference / reconstruction. To address this susceptibility, we propose an innovative approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for secure autonomous UAV navigation. This end-to-end secure framework is designed for real-time video feeds captured by UAV cameras and utilizes FHE to perform inference on encrypted input images. While FHE allows computations on encrypted data, certain computational operators are yet to be implemented. Convolutional neural networks, fully connected neural networks, activation functions and OpenAI Gym Library are meticulously adapted to the FHE domain to enable encrypted data processing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach through extensive experimentation. Our proposed approach ensures security and privacy in autonomous UAV navigation with negligible loss in performance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deterministic Renewable Energy Forecasting Guided by Multiple-Location Weather Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been established as an efficient remedy for both energy shortages and the environmental pollution stemming from conventional energy production methods. Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data. The conducted experimental evaluation on a day-ahead solar and wind energy forecasting scenario on five datasets demonstrated that the proposed method achieves top results, outperforming all competitive time-series forecasting state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Part-Guided 3D RL for Sim2Real Articulated Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating unseen articulated objects through visual feedback is a critical but challenging task for real robots. Existing learning-based solutions mainly focus on visual affordance learning or other pre-trained visual models to guide manipulation policies, which face challenges for novel instances in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel part-guided 3D RL framework, which can learn to manipulate articulated objects without demonstrations. We combine the strengths of 2D segmentation and 3D RL to improve the efficiency of RL policy training. To improve the stability of the policy on real robots, we design a Frame-consistent Uncertainty-aware Sampling (FUS) strategy to get a condensed and hierarchical 3D representation. In addition, a single versatile RL policy can be trained on multiple articulated object manipulation tasks simultaneously in simulation and shows great generalizability to novel categories and instances. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both simulation and real-world settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-VCLab/Part-Guided-3D-RL-for-Sim2Real-Articulated-Object-Manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To guide the design of better iterative optimisation heuristics, it is imperative to understand how inherent structural biases within algorithm components affect the performance on a wide variety of search landscapes. This study explores the impact of structural bias in the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (modCMA), focusing on the roles of various modulars within the algorithm. Through an extensive investigation involving 435,456 configurations of modCMA, we identified key modules that significantly influence structural bias of various classes. Our analysis utilized the Deep-BIAS toolbox for structural bias detection and classification, complemented by SHAP analysis for quantifying module contributions. The performance of these configurations was tested on a sequence of affine-recombined functions, maintaining fixed optimum locations while gradually varying the landscape features. Our results demonstrate an interplay between module-induced structural bias and algorithm performance across different landscape characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Novel Spike Transformer Network for Depth Estimation from Event Cameras via Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation is crucial for interpreting complex environments, especially in areas such as autonomous vehicle navigation and robotics. Nonetheless, obtaining accurate depth readings from event camera data remains a formidable challenge. Event cameras operate differently from traditional digital cameras, continuously capturing data and generating asynchronous binary spikes that encode time, location, and light intensity. Yet, the unique sampling mechanisms of event cameras render standard image based algorithms inadequate for processing spike data. This necessitates the development of innovative, spike-aware algorithms tailored for event cameras, a task compounded by the irregularity, continuity, noise, and spatial and temporal characteristics inherent in spiking data.Harnessing the strong generalization capabilities of transformer neural networks for spatiotemporal data, we propose a purely spike-driven spike transformer network for depth estimation from spiking camera data. To address performance limitations with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), we introduce a novel single-stage cross-modality knowledge transfer framework leveraging knowledge from a large vision foundational model of artificial neural networks (ANN) (DINOv2) to enhance the performance of SNNs with limited data. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show substantial improvements over existing models, with notable gains in Absolute Relative and Square Relative errors (49% and 39.77% improvements over the benchmark model Spike-T, respectively). Besides accuracy, the proposed model also demonstrates reduced power consumptions, a critical factor for practical applications.</description>

Abstract: The number of open source language models that can produce Turkish is increasing day by day, as in other languages. In order to create the basic versions of such models, the training of multilingual models is usually continued with Turkish corpora. The alternative is to train the model with only Turkish corpora. In this study, we first introduce the cosmosGPT models that we created with this alternative method. Then, we introduce new finetune datasets for basic language models to fulfill user requests and new evaluation datasets for measuring the capabilities of Turkish language models. Finally, a comprehensive comparison of the adapted Turkish language models on different capabilities is presented. The results show that the language models we built with the monolingual corpus have promising performance despite being about 10 times smaller than the others.</description>

      <title>Can a Multichoice Dataset be Repurposed for Extractive Question Answering?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has favored major languages such as English, leaving a significant gap for many others due to limited resources. This is especially evident in the context of data annotation, a task whose importance cannot be underestimated, but which is time-consuming and costly. Thus, any dataset for resource-poor languages is precious, in particular when it is task-specific. Here, we explore the feasibility of repurposing existing datasets for a new NLP task: we repurposed the Belebele dataset (Bandarkar et al., 2023), which was designed for multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), to enable extractive QA (EQA) in the style of machine reading comprehension. We present annotation guidelines and a parallel EQA dataset for English and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We also present QA evaluation results for several monolingual and cross-lingual QA pairs including English, MSA, and five Arabic dialects. Our aim is to enable others to adapt our approach for the 120+ other language variants in Belebele, many of which are deemed under-resourced. We also conduct a thorough analysis and share our insights from the process, which we hope will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and the opportunities associated with task reformulation in NLP research.</description>

      <title>Similarity Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Homogenization of Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft, porous mechanical metamaterials exhibit pattern transformations that may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Potential of AI for Spatially Sensitive Nature-Related Financial Risks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing recognition among financial institutions, financial regulators and policy makers of the importance of addressing nature-related risks and opportunities. Evaluating and assessing nature-related risks for financial institutions is challenging due to the large volume of heterogeneous data available on nature and the complexity of investment value chains and the various components' relationship to nature. The dual problem of scaling data analytics and analysing complex systems can be addressed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). We address issues such as plugging existing data gaps with discovered data, data estimation under uncertainty, time series analysis and (near) real-time updates. This report presents potential AI solutions for models of two distinct use cases, the Brazil Beef Supply Use Case and the Water Utility Use Case. Our two use cases cover a broad perspective within sustainable finance. The Brazilian cattle farming use case is an example of greening finance - integrating nature-related considerations into mainstream financial decision-making to transition investments away from sectors with poor historical track records and unsustainable operations. The deployment of nature-based solutions in the UK water utility use case is an example of financing green - driving investment to nature-positive outcomes. The two use cases also cover different sectors, geographies, financial assets and AI modelling techniques, providing an overview on how AI could be applied to different challenges relating to nature's integration into finance. This report is primarily aimed at financial institutions but is also of interest to ESG data providers, TNFD, systems modellers, and, of course, AI practitioners.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layers for Effective Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Convolutional Layer (QCL) is considered as one of the core of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) due to its efficient data feature extraction capability. However, the current principle of QCL is not as mathematically understandable as Classical Convolutional Layer (CCL) due to its black-box structure. Moreover, classical data mapping in many QCLs is inefficient. To this end, firstly, the Quantum Adjoint Convolution Operation (QACO) consisting of a quantum amplitude encoding and its inverse is theoretically shown to be equivalent to the quantum normalization of the convolution operation based on the Frobenius inner product while achieving an efficient characterization of the data. Subsequently, QACO is extended into a Quantum Adjoint Convolutional Layer (QACL) by Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to compute all Frobenius inner products in parallel. At last, comparative simulation experiments are carried out on PennyLane and TensorFlow platforms, mainly for the two cases of kernel fixed and unfixed in QACL. The results demonstrate that QACL with the insight of special quantum properties for the same images, provides higher training accuracy in MNIST and Fashion MNIST classification experiments, but sacrifices the learning performance to some extent. Predictably, our research lays the foundation for the development of efficient and interpretable quantum convolutional networks and also advances the field of quantum machine vision.</description>

      <title>How Could AI Support Design Education? A Study Across Fields Fuels Situating Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the process and findings from a case study of design educators' practices of assessment and feedback to fuel theorizing about how to make AI useful in service of human experience. We build on Suchman's theory of situated actions. We perform a qualitative study of 11 educators in 5 fields, who teach design processes situated in project-based learning contexts. Through qualitative data gathering and analysis, we derive codes: design process; assessment and feedback challenges; and computational support.
  We twice invoke creative cognition's family resemblance principle. First, to explain how design instructors already use assessment rubrics and second, to explain the analogous role for design creativity analytics: no particular trait is necessary or sufficient; each only tends to indicate good design work. Human teachers remain essential. We develop a set of situated design creativity analytics--Fluency, Flexibility, Visual Consistency, Multiscale Organization, and Legible Contrast--to support instructors' efforts, by providing on-demand, learning objectives-based assessment and feedback to students.
  We theorize a methodology, which we call situating analytics, firstly because making AI support living human activity depends on aligning what analytics measure with situated practices. Further, we realize that analytics can become most significant to users by situating them through interfaces that integrate them into the material contexts of their use. Here, this means situating design creativity analytics into actual design environments. Through the case study, we identify situating analytics as a methodology for explaining analytics to users, because the iterative process of alignment with practice has the potential to enable data scientists to derive analytics that make sense as part of and support situated human experiences.</description>

      <title>M3BAT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multimodal Mobile Sensing with Multi-Branch Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for inferences regarding health and well being, behavior, and context. However, a significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in real world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the distribution of data in the real world, the deployment environment. While extensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such as audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN, called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Spatial-frequency Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network for Low-Light Remote Sensing Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN.</description>

      <title>Real-World Deployment of a Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative Multiagent Planning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We would like to enable a collaborative multiagent team to navigate at long length scales and under uncertainty in real-world environments. In practice, planning complexity scales with the number of agents in the team, with the length scale of the environment, and with environmental uncertainty. Enabling tractable planning requires developing abstract models that can represent complex, high-quality plans. However, such models often abstract away information needed to generate directly-executable plans for real-world agents in real-world environments, as planning in such detail, especially in the presence of real-world uncertainty, would be computationally intractable. In this paper, we describe the deployment of a planning system that used a hierarchy of planners to execute collaborative multiagent navigation tasks in real-world, unknown environments. By developing a planning system that was robust to failures at every level of the planning hierarchy, we enabled the team to complete collaborative navigation tasks, even in the presence of imperfect planning abstractions and real-world uncertainty. We deployed our approach on a Clearpath Husky-Jackal team navigating in a structured outdoor environment, and demonstrated that the system enabled the agents to successfully execute collaborative plans.</description>

      <title>"ChatGPT Is Here to Help, Not to Replace Anybody" -- An Evaluation of Students' Opinions On Integrating ChatGPT In CS Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and Bard are capable of producing code based on textual descriptions, with remarkable efficacy. Such technology will have profound implications for computing education, raising concerns about cheating, excessive dependence, and a decline in computational thinking skills, among others. There has been extensive research on how teachers should handle this challenge but it is also important to understand how students feel about this paradigm shift. In this research, 52 first-year CS students were surveyed in order to assess their views on technologies with code-generation capabilities, both from academic and professional perspectives. Our findings indicate that while students generally favor the academic use of GPT, they don't over rely on it, only mildly asking for its help. Although most students benefit from GPT, some struggle to use it effectively, urging the need for specific GPT training. Opinions on GPT's impact on their professional lives vary, but there is a consensus on its importance in academic practice.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptive and Fine-grained Anomaly Detection for Single-cell Sequencing Data and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fined-grained anomalous cell detection from affected tissues is critical for clinical diagnosis and pathological research. Single-cell sequencing data provide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly detection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample and multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous cells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth, a novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates the detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous cells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first theoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative models for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us to develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer in ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types of tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain contexts. Our code is available at https://github.com/Catchxu/ACsleuth.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer random features and the approximation power of neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A neural architecture with randomly initialized weights, in the infinite width limit, is equivalent to a Gaussian Random Field whose covariance function is the so-called Neural Network Gaussian Process kernel (NNGP). We prove that a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the NNGP contains only functions that can be approximated by the architecture. To achieve a certain approximation error the required number of neurons in each layer is defined by the RKHS norm of the target function. Moreover, the approximation can be constructed from a supervised dataset by a random multi-layer representation of an input vector, together with training of the last layer's weights.
  For a 2-layer NN and a domain equal to an $n-1$-dimensional sphere in ${\mathbb R}^n$, we compare the number of neurons required by Barron's theorem and by the multi-layer features construction. We show that if eigenvalues of the integral operator of the NNGP decay slower than $k^{-n-\frac{2}{3}}$ where $k$ is an order of an eigenvalue, then our theorem guarantees a more succinct neural network approximation than Barron's theorem. We also make some computational experiments to verify our theoretical findings. Our experiments show that realistic neural networks easily learn target functions even when both theorems do not give any guarantees.</description>

      <title>CEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Counterfactual Text Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual text generation aims to minimally change a text, such that it is classified differently. Judging advancements in method development for counterfactual text generation is hindered by a non-uniform usage of data sets and metrics in related work. We propose CEval, a benchmark for comparing counterfactual text generation methods. CEval unifies counterfactual and text quality metrics, includes common counterfactual datasets with human annotations, standard baselines (MICE, GDBA, CREST) and the open-source language model LLAMA-2. Our experiments found no perfect method for generating counterfactual text. Methods that excel at counterfactual metrics often produce lower-quality text while LLMs with simple prompts generate high-quality text but struggle with counterfactual criteria. By making CEval available as an open-source Python library, we encourage the community to contribute more methods and maintain consistent evaluation in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of conformal prediction with conditional guarantees. Prior work has shown that it is impossible to construct nontrivial prediction sets with full conditional coverage guarantees. A wealth of research has considered relaxations of full conditional guarantees, relying on some predefined uncertainty structures. Departing from this line of thinking, we propose Partition Learning Conformal Prediction (PLCP), a framework to improve conditional validity of prediction sets through learning uncertainty-guided features from the calibration data. We implement PLCP efficiently with alternating gradient descent, utilizing off-the-shelf machine learning models. We further analyze PLCP theoretically and provide conditional guarantees for infinite and finite sample sizes. Finally, our experimental results over four real-world and synthetic datasets show the superior performance of PLCP compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of coverage and length in both classification and regression scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tabular Data Contrastive Learning via Class-Conditioned and Feature-Correlation Based Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a model pre-training technique by first creating similar views of the original data, and then encouraging the data and its corresponding views to be close in the embedding space. Contrastive learning has witnessed success in image and natural language data, thanks to the domain-specific augmentation techniques that are both intuitive and effective. Nonetheless, in tabular domain, the predominant augmentation technique for creating views is through corrupting tabular entries via swapping values, which is not as sound or effective. We propose a simple yet powerful improvement to this augmentation technique: corrupting tabular data conditioned on class identity. Specifically, when corrupting a specific tabular entry from an anchor row, instead of randomly sampling a value in the same feature column from the entire table uniformly, we only sample from rows that are identified to be within the same class as the anchor row. We assume the semi-supervised learning setting, and adopt the pseudo labeling technique for obtaining class identities over all table rows. We also explore the novel idea of selecting features to be corrupted based on feature correlation structures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the conventional corruption method for tabular data classification tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/willtop/Tabular-Class-Conditioned-SSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandits (MAB) and causal MABs (CMAB) are established frameworks for decision-making problems. The majority of prior work typically studies and solves individual MAB and CMAB in isolation for a given problem and associated data. However, decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for CMABs addresses the situation where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving CMABs defined on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related via an abstraction map. Formally, we introduce the problem of causally abstracted MABs (CAMABs) by relying on the theory of causal abstraction in order to express a rigorous abstraction map. We propose algorithms to learn in a CAMAB, and study their regret. We illustrate the limitations and the strengths of our algorithms on a real-world scenario related to online advertising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event reasoning is a fundamental ability that underlies many applications. It requires event schema knowledge to perform global reasoning and needs to deal with the diversity of the inter-event relations and the reasoning paradigms. How well LLMs accomplish event reasoning on various relations and reasoning paradigms remains unknown. To mitigate this disparity, we comprehensively evaluate the abilities of event reasoning of LLMs. We introduce a novel benchmark EV2 for EValuation of EVent reasoning. EV2 consists of two levels of evaluation of schema and instance and is comprehensive in relations and reasoning paradigms. We conduct extensive experiments on EV2. We find that LLMs have abilities to accomplish event reasoning but their performances are far from satisfactory. We also notice the imbalance of event reasoning abilities in LLMs. Besides, LLMs have event schema knowledge, however, they're not aligned with humans on how to utilize the knowledge. Based on these findings, we introduce two methods to guide the LLMs to utilize the event schema knowledge. Both methods achieve improvements.</description>

Abstract: This research explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the extraction of requirement-related legal content in the food safety domain and checking legal compliance of regulatory artifacts. With Industry 4.0 revolutionizing the food industry and with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) reshaping privacy policies and data processing agreements, there is a growing gap between regulatory analysis and recent technological advancements. This study aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LLMs, namely BERT and GPT models, to accurately classify legal provisions and automate compliance checks. Our findings demonstrate promising results, indicating LLMs' significant potential to enhance legal compliance and regulatory analysis efficiency, notably by reducing manual workload and improving accuracy within reasonable time and financial constraints.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Agent as a Mechanical Designer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional mechanical design paradigms rely on experts systematically refining concepts through experience-guided modification and FEA to meet specific requirements. However, this approach can be time-consuming and heavily dependent on prior knowledge and experience. While numerous machine learning models have been developed to streamline this intensive and expert-driven iterative process, these methods typically demand extensive training data and considerable computational resources. Furthermore, methods based on deep learning are usually restricted to the specific domains and tasks for which they were trained, limiting their applicability across different tasks. This creates a trade-off between the efficiency of automation and the demand for resources. In this study, we present a novel approach that integrates pre-trained LLMs with a FEM module. The FEM module evaluates each design and provides essential feedback, guiding the LLMs to continuously learn, plan, generate, and optimize designs without the need for domain-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in managing the iterative optimization of truss structures, showcasing its capability to reason about and refine designs according to structured feedback and criteria. Our results reveal that these LLM-based agents can successfully generate truss designs that comply with natural language specifications with a success rate of up to 90%, which varies according to the applied constraints. By employing prompt-based optimization techniques we show that LLM based agents exhibit optimization behavior when provided with solution-score pairs to iteratively refine designs to meet specifications. This ability of LLM agents to produce viable designs and optimize them based on their inherent reasoning capabilities highlights their potential to develop and implement effective design strategies autonomously.</description>

      <title>Using Neural Implicit Flow To Represent Latent Dynamics Of Canonical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced class of architectures known as Neural Operators has emerged as highly versatile tools applicable to a wide range of tasks in the field of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), including data representation and forecasting. In this study, we investigate the capabilities of Neural Implicit Flow (NIF), a recently developed mesh-agnostic neural operator, for representing the latent dynamics of canonical systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS), forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV), and Sine-Gordon (SG) equations, as well as for extracting dynamically relevant information from them. Finally we assess the applicability of NIF as a dimensionality reduction algorithm and conduct a comparative analysis with another widely recognized family of neural operators, known as Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets).</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Overview and Field Guide for Future Research Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11561v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has achieved significant milestones in research and development over the last two decades. There is increasing interest in the field as the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises safer and more ecologically friendly transportation systems. With the rapid progress in computationally powerful artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, AVs can sense their environment with high precision, make safe real-time decisions, and operate reliably without human intervention. However, intelligent decision-making in such vehicles is not generally understandable by humans in the current state of the art, and such deficiency hinders this technology from being socially acceptable. Hence, aside from making safe real-time decisions, AVs must also explain their AI-guided decision-making process in order to be regulatory compliant across many jurisdictions. Our study sheds comprehensive light on the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches for AVs. In particular, we make the following contributions. First, we provide a thorough overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging approaches for XAI-based autonomous driving. We then propose a conceptual framework that considers the essential elements for explainable end-to-end autonomous driving. Finally, we present XAI-based prospective directions and emerging paradigms for future directions that hold promise for enhancing transparency, trustworthiness, and societal acceptance of AVs.</description>

      <title>MiniZero: Comparative Analysis of AlphaZero and MuZero on Go, Othello, and Atari Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents MiniZero, a zero-knowledge learning framework that supports four state-of-the-art algorithms, including AlphaZero, MuZero, Gumbel AlphaZero, and Gumbel MuZero. While these algorithms have demonstrated super-human performance in many games, it remains unclear which among them is most suitable or efficient for specific tasks. Through MiniZero, we systematically evaluate the performance of each algorithm in two board games, 9x9 Go and 8x8 Othello, as well as 57 Atari games. For two board games, using more simulations generally results in higher performance. However, the choice of AlphaZero and MuZero may differ based on game properties. For Atari games, both MuZero and Gumbel MuZero are worth considering. Since each game has unique characteristics, different algorithms and simulations yield varying results. In addition, we introduce an approach, called progressive simulation, which progressively increases the simulation budget during training to allocate computation more efficiently. Our empirical results demonstrate that progressive simulation achieves significantly superior performance in two board games. By making our framework and trained models publicly available, this paper contributes a benchmark for future research on zero-knowledge learning algorithms, assisting researchers in algorithm selection and comparison against these zero-knowledge learning baselines. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/minizero.</description>

      <title>Self Attention with Temporal Prior: Can We Learn More from Arrow of Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many diverse phenomena in nature often inherently encode both short- and long-term temporal dependencies, which especially result from the direction of the flow of time. In this respect, we discovered experimental evidence suggesting that interrelations of these events are higher for closer time stamps. However, to be able for attention-based models to learn these regularities in short-term dependencies, it requires large amounts of data, which are often infeasible. This is because, while they are good at learning piece-wise temporal dependencies, attention-based models lack structures that encode biases in time series. As a resolution, we propose a simple and efficient method that enables attention layers to better encode the short-term temporal bias of these data sets by applying learnable, adaptive kernels directly to the attention matrices. We chose various prediction tasks for the experiments using Electronic Health Records (EHR) data sets since they are great examples with underlying long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Our experiments show exceptional classification results compared to best-performing models on most tasks and data sets.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models for Education: Foundational Capabilities, Potentials, and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Online education platforms, leveraging the internet to distribute education resources, seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in real-time communication with students. They often struggle to address the diverse obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Solving the problems encountered by students poses a significant challenge for traditional deep learning models, as it requires not only a broad spectrum of subject knowledge but also the ability to understand what constitutes a student's individual difficulties. It's challenging for traditional machine learning models, as they lack the capacity to comprehend students' personalized needs. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests. Although LLMs have been successful in various fields, creating an LLM-based education system is still challenging for the wide range of educational skills required. This paper reviews the recently emerged LLM research related to educational capabilities, including mathematics, writing, programming, reasoning, and knowledge-based question answering, with the aim to explore their potential in constructing the next-generation intelligent education system. Specifically, for each capability, we focus on investigating two aspects. Firstly, we examine the current state of LLMs regarding this capability: how advanced they have become, whether they surpass human abilities, and what deficiencies might exist. Secondly, we evaluate whether the development methods for LLMs in this area are generalizable, that is, whether these methods can be applied to construct a comprehensive educational supermodel with strengths across various capabilities, rather than being effective in only a singular aspect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world planning applications, agents might be interested in finding plans whose actions have costs that are as uniform as possible. Such plans provide agents with a sense of stability and predictability, which are key features when humans are the agents executing plans suggested by planning tools. This paper adapts three uniformity metrics to automated planning, and introduce planning-based compilations that allow to lexicographically optimize sum of action costs and action costs uniformity. Experimental results both in well-known and novel planning benchmarks show that the reformulated tasks can be effectively solved in practice to generate uniform plans.</description>

      <title>OntoChat: a Framework for Conversational Ontology Engineering using Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontology engineering (OE) in large projects poses a number of challenges arising from the heterogeneous backgrounds of the various stakeholders, domain experts, and their complex interactions with ontology designers. This multi-party interaction often creates systematic ambiguities and biases from the elicitation of ontology requirements, which directly affect the design, evaluation and may jeopardise the target reuse. Meanwhile, current OE methodologies strongly rely on manual activities (e.g., interviews, discussion pages). After collecting evidence on the most crucial OE activities, we introduce \textbf{OntoChat}, a framework for conversational ontology engineering that supports requirement elicitation, analysis, and testing. By interacting with a conversational agent, users can steer the creation of user stories and the extraction of competency questions, while receiving computational support to analyse the overall requirements and test early versions of the resulting ontologies. We evaluate OntoChat by replicating the engineering of the Music Meta Ontology, and collecting preliminary metrics on the effectiveness of each component from users. We release all code at https://github.com/King-s-Knowledge-Graph-Lab/OntoChat.</description>

      <title>Learning World Models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Representations in Explainable AI: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretable representations are the backbone of many explainers that target black-box predictive systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. They translate the low-level data representation necessary for good predictive performance into high-level human-intelligible concepts used to convey the explanatory insights. Notably, the explanation type and its cognitive complexity are directly controlled by the interpretable representation, tweaking which allows to target a particular audience and use case. However, many explainers built upon interpretable representations overlook their merit and fall back on default solutions that often carry implicit assumptions, thereby degrading the explanatory power and reliability of such techniques. To address this problem, we study properties of interpretable representations that encode presence and absence of human-comprehensible concepts. We demonstrate how they are operationalised for tabular, image and text data; discuss their assumptions, strengths and weaknesses; identify their core building blocks; and scrutinise their configuration and parameterisation. In particular, this in-depth analysis allows us to pinpoint their explanatory properties, desiderata and scope for (malicious) manipulation in the context of tabular data where a linear model is used to quantify the influence of interpretable concepts on a black-box prediction. Our findings lead to a range of recommendations for designing trustworthy interpretable representations; specifically, the benefits of class-aware (supervised) discretisation of tabular data, e.g., with decision trees, and sensitivity of image interpretable representations to segmentation granularity and occlusion colour.</description>

      <title>Full Characterization of Adaptively Strong Majority Voting in Crowdsourcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowdsourcing, quality control is commonly achieved by having workers examine items and vote on their correctness. To minimize the impact of unreliable worker responses, a $\delta$-margin voting process is utilized, where additional votes are solicited until a predetermined threshold $\delta$ for agreement between workers is exceeded. The process is widely adopted but only as a heuristic. Our research presents a modeling approach using absorbing Markov chains to analyze the characteristics of this voting process that matter in crowdsourced processes. We provide closed-form equations for the quality of resulting consensus vote, the expected number of votes required for consensus, the variance of vote requirements, and other distribution moments. Our findings demonstrate how the threshold $\delta$ can be adjusted to achieve quality equivalence across voting processes that employ workers with varying accuracy levels. We also provide efficiency-equalizing payment rates for voting processes with different expected response accuracy levels. Additionally, our model considers items with varying degrees of difficulty and uncertainty about the difficulty of each example. Our simulations, using real-world crowdsourced vote data, validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model in characterizing the consensus aggregation process. The results of our study can be effectively employed in practical crowdsourcing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.08108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose novel learning frameworks to tackle optimal control problems by applying the Pontryagin maximum principle and then solving for a Hamiltonian dynamical system. Applying the Pontryagin maximum principle to the original optimal control problem shifts the learning focus to reduced Hamiltonian dynamics and corresponding adjoint variables. Then, the reduced Hamiltonian networks can be learned by going backwards in time and then minimizing loss function deduced from the Pontryagin maximum principle's conditions. The learning process is further improved by progressively learning a posterior distribution of the reduced Hamiltonians. This is achieved through utilizing a variational autoencoder which leads to more effective path exploration process. We apply our learning frameworks called NeuralPMP to various control tasks and obtain competitive results.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Semantic AI Security in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems rely on AI components to make safety and correct driving decisions. Unfortunately, today's AI algorithms are known to be generally vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, for such AI component-level vulnerabilities to be semantically impactful at the system level, it needs to address non-trivial semantic gaps both (1) from the system-level attack input spaces to those at AI component level, and (2) from AI component-level attack impacts to those at the system level. In this paper, we define such research space as semantic AI security as opposed to generic AI security. Over the past 5 years, increasingly more research works are performed to tackle such semantic AI security challenges in AD context, which has started to show an exponential growth trend.
  In this paper, we perform the first systematization of knowledge of such growing semantic AD AI security research space. In total, we collect and analyze 53 such papers, and systematically taxonomize them based on research aspects critical for the security field. We summarize 6 most substantial scientific gaps observed based on quantitative comparisons both vertically among existing AD AI security works and horizontally with security works from closely-related domains. With these, we are able to provide insights and potential future directions not only at the design level, but also at the research goal, methodology, and community levels. To address the most critical scientific methodology-level gap, we take the initiative to develop an open-source, uniform, and extensible system-driven evaluation platform, named PASS, for the semantic AD AI security research community. We also use our implemented platform prototype to showcase the capabilities and benefits of such a platform using representative semantic AD AI attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate routing network status estimation is a key component in Software Defined Networking. However, existing deep-learning-based methods for modeling network routing are not able to extrapolate towards unseen feature distributions. Nor are they able to handle scaled and drifted network attributes in test sets that include open-world inputs. To deal with these challenges, we propose a novel approach for modeling network routing, using Graph Neural Networks. Our method can also be used for network-latency estimation. Supported by a domain-knowledge-assisted graph formulation, our model shares a stable performance across different network sizes and configurations of routing networks, while at the same time being able to extrapolate towards unseen sizes, configurations, and user behavior. We show that our model outperforms most conventional deep-learning-based models, in terms of prediction accuracy, computational resources, inference speed, as well as ability to generalize towards open-world input.</description>

      <title>Attribute-Guided Multi-Level Attention Network for Fine-Grained Fashion Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-grained fashion retrieval searches for items that share a similar attribute with the query image. Most existing methods use a pre-trained feature extractor (e.g., ResNet 50) to capture image representations. However, a pre-trained feature backbone is typically trained for image classification and object detection, which are fundamentally different tasks from fine-grained fashion retrieval. Therefore, existing methods suffer from a feature gap problem when directly using the pre-trained backbone for fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we introduce an attribute-guided multi-level attention network (AG-MAN). Specifically, we first enhance the pre-trained feature extractor to capture multi-level image embedding, thereby enriching the low-level features within these representations. Then, we propose a classification scheme where images with the same attribute, albeit with different values, are categorized into the same class. This can further alleviate the feature gap problem by perturbing object-centric feature learning. Moreover, we propose an improved attribute-guided attention module for extracting more accurate attribute-specific representations. Our model consistently outperforms existing attention based methods when assessed on the FashionAI (62.8788% in MAP), DeepFashion (8.9804% in MAP), and Zappos50k datasets (93.32% in Prediction accuracy). Especially, ours improves the most typical ASENet_V2 model by 2.12%, 0.31%, and 0.78% points in FashionAI, DeepFashion, and Zappos50k datasets, respectively.

      <title>Learning Performance-Improving Code Edits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07867v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the decline of Moore's law, optimizing program performance has become a major focus of software research. However, high-level optimizations such as API and algorithm changes remain elusive due to the difficulty of understanding the semantics of code. Simultaneously, pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities at solving a wide range of programming tasks. To that end, we introduce a framework for adapting LLMs to high-level program optimization. First, we curate a dataset of performance-improving edits made by human programmers of over 77,000 competitive C++ programming submission pairs, accompanied by extensive unit tests. A major challenge is the significant variability of measuring performance on commodity hardware, which can lead to spurious "improvements." To isolate and reliably evaluate the impact of program optimizations, we design an environment based on the gem5 full system simulator, the de facto simulator used in academia and industry. Next, we propose a broad range of adaptation strategies for code optimization; for prompting, these include retrieval-based few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought, and for finetuning, these include performance-conditioned generation and synthetic data augmentation based on self-play. A combination of these techniques achieves a mean speedup of 6.86 with eight generations, higher than average optimizations from individual programmers (3.66). Using our model's fastest generations, we set a new upper limit on the fastest speedup possible for our dataset at 9.64 compared to using the fastest human submissions available (9.56).</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic explainable artificial intelligence for object detection in image data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been widely used for building high-performance Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications. Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, which has been greatly progressed through developing large and intricate deep learning models. However, the lack of transparency is a big challenge that may not allow the widespread adoption of these models. Explainable artificial intelligence is a field of research where methods are developed to help users understand the behavior, decision logics, and vulnerabilities of AI systems. Previously, few explanation methods were developed for object detection, based on the idea of random masks. However, random masks may raise some issues regarding the actual importance of pixels within an image. In this paper, we design and implement a black-box explanation method named Black-box Object Detection Explanation by Masking (BODEM) through adopting a hierarchical random masking approach for AI-based object detection systems. We propose a hierarchical random masking framework in which coarse-grained masks are used in lower levels to find salient regions within an image, and fine-grained mask are used to refine the salient regions in higher levels. Experimentations on various object detection datasets and models showed that BODEM can be effectively used to explain the behavior of object detectors. Moreover, our method outperformed Detector Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (D-RISE) with respect to different quantitative measures of explanation effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that BODEM can be an effective method for explaining and validating object detection systems in black-box testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sparse Weight Averaging with Multiple Particles for Iterative Magnitude Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the ever-increasing size of modern neural networks, the significance of sparse architectures has surged due to their accelerated inference speeds and minimal memory demands. When it comes to global pruning techniques, Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) still stands as a state-of-the-art algorithm despite its simple nature, particularly in extremely sparse regimes. In light of the recent finding that the two successive matching IMP solutions are linearly connected without a loss barrier, we propose Sparse Weight Averaging with Multiple Particles (SWAMP), a straightforward modification of IMP that achieves performance comparable to an ensemble of two IMP solutions. For every iteration, we concurrently train multiple sparse models, referred to as particles, using different batch orders yet the same matching ticket, and then weight average such models to produce a single mask. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines across different sparsities through extensive experiments on various data and neural network structures.</description>

      <title>Deep Classifier Mimicry without Data Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to pre-trained models has recently emerged as a standard across numerous machine learning domains. Unfortunately, access to the original data the models were trained on may not equally be granted. This makes it tremendously challenging to fine-tune, compress models, adapt continually, or to do any other type of data-driven update. We posit that original data access may however not be required. Specifically, we propose Contrastive Abductive Knowledge Extraction (CAKE), a model-agnostic knowledge distillation procedure that mimics deep classifiers without access to the original data. To this end, CAKE generates pairs of noisy synthetic samples and diffuses them contrastively toward a model's decision boundary. We empirically corroborate CAKE's effectiveness using several benchmark datasets and various architectural choices, paving the way for broad application.</description>

      <title>DocumentCLIP: Linking Figures and Main Body Text in Reflowed Documents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language pretraining models have achieved great success in supporting multimedia applications by understanding the alignments between images and text. While existing vision-language pretraining models primarily focus on understanding single image associated with a single piece of text, they often ignore the alignment at the intra-document level, consisting of multiple sentences with multiple images. In this work, we propose DocumentCLIP, a salience-aware contrastive learning framework to enforce vision-language pretraining models to comprehend the interaction between images and longer text within documents. Our model is beneficial for the real-world multimodal document understanding like news article, magazines, product descriptions, which contain linguistically and visually richer content. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore multimodal intra-document links by contrastive learning. In addition, we collect a large Wikipedia dataset for pretraining, which provides various topics and structures. Experiments show DocumentCLIP not only outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the supervised setting, but also achieves the best zero-shot performance in the wild after human evaluation. Our code is available at https://github.com/FuxiaoLiu/DocumentCLIP.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding In-Context Learning with Contrastive Demonstrations and Saliency Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of various demonstration components in the in-context learning (ICL) performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we explore the impacts of ground-truth labels, input distribution, and complementary explanations, particularly when these are altered or perturbed. We build on previous work, which offers mixed findings on how these elements influence ICL. To probe these questions, we employ explainable NLP (XNLP) methods and utilize saliency maps of contrastive demonstrations for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. Our findings reveal that flipping ground-truth labels significantly affects the saliency, though it's more noticeable in larger LLMs. Our analysis of the input distribution at a granular level reveals that changing sentiment-indicative terms in a sentiment analysis task to neutral ones does not have as substantial an impact as altering ground-truth labels. Finally, we find that the effectiveness of complementary explanations in boosting ICL performance is task-dependent, with limited benefits seen in sentiment analysis tasks compared to symbolic reasoning tasks. These insights are critical for understanding the functionality of LLMs and guiding the development of effective demonstrations, which is increasingly relevant in light of the growing use of LLMs in applications such as ChatGPT. Our research code is publicly available at https://github.com/paihengxu/XICL.</description>

      <title>Subtractive Mixture Models via Squaring: Representation and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture models are traditionally represented and learned by adding several distributions as components. Allowing mixtures to subtract probability mass or density can drastically reduce the number of components needed to model complex distributions. However, learning such subtractive mixtures while ensuring they still encode a non-negative function is challenging. We investigate how to learn and perform inference on deep subtractive mixtures by squaring them. We do this in the framework of probabilistic circuits, which enable us to represent tensorized mixtures and generalize several other subtractive models. We theoretically prove that the class of squared circuits allowing subtractions can be exponentially more expressive than traditional additive mixtures; and, we empirically show this increased expressiveness on a series of real-world distribution estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Distillation for Unsupervised Constituency Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the unsupervised constituency parsing task, which organizes words and phrases of a sentence into a hierarchical structure without using linguistically annotated data. We observe that existing unsupervised parsers capture differing aspects of parsing structures, which can be leveraged to enhance unsupervised parsing performance. To this end, we propose a notion of "tree averaging," based on which we further propose a novel ensemble method for unsupervised parsing. To improve inference efficiency, we further distill the ensemble knowledge into a student model; such an ensemble-then-distill process is an effective approach to mitigate the over-smoothing problem existing in common multi-teacher distilling methods. Experiments show that our method surpasses all previous approaches, consistently demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various runs, with different ensemble components, and under domain-shift conditions.</description>

      <title>Raising the ClaSS of Streaming Time Series Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ubiquitous sensors today emit high frequency streams of numerical measurements that reflect properties of human, animal, industrial, commercial, and natural processes. Shifts in such processes, e.g. caused by external events or internal state changes, manifest as changes in the recorded signals. The task of streaming time series segmentation (STSS) is to partition the stream into consecutive variable-sized segments that correspond to states of the observed processes or entities. The partition operation itself must in performance be able to cope with the input frequency of the signals. We introduce ClaSS, a novel, efficient, and highly accurate algorithm for STSS. ClaSS assesses the homogeneity of potential partitions using self-supervised time series classification and applies statistical tests to detect significant change points (CPs). In our experimental evaluation using two large benchmarks and six real-world data archives, we found ClaSS to be significantly more precise than eight state-of-the-art competitors. Its space and time complexity is independent of segment sizes and linear only in the sliding window size. We also provide ClaSS as a window operator with an average throughput of 1k data points per second for the Apache Flink streaming engine.</description>

      <title>Transformers in the Service of Description Logic-based Contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in transformer-based models have initiated research interests in investigating their ability to learn to perform reasoning tasks. However, most of the contexts used for this purpose are in practice very simple: generated from short (fragments of) first-order logic sentences with only a few logical operators and quantifiers. In this work, we construct the natural language dataset, DELTA$_D$, using the description logic language $\mathcal{ALCQ}$. DELTA$_D$ contains 384K examples, and increases in two dimensions: i) reasoning depth, and ii) linguistic complexity. In this way, we systematically investigate the reasoning ability of a supervised fine-tuned DeBERTa-based model and of two large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) with few-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that the DeBERTa-based model can master the reasoning task and that the performance of GPTs can improve significantly even when a small number of samples is provided (9 shots). We open-source our code and datasets.</description>

      <title>MAIRA-1: A specialised large multimodal model for radiology report generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a radiology-specific multimodal model for the task for generating radiological reports from chest X-rays (CXRs). Our work builds on the idea that large language model(s) can be equipped with multimodal capabilities through alignment with pre-trained vision encoders. On natural images, this has been shown to allow multimodal models to gain image understanding and description capabilities. Our proposed model (MAIRA-1) leverages a CXR-specific image encoder in conjunction with a fine-tuned large language model based on Vicuna-7B, and text-based data augmentation, to produce reports with state-of-the-art quality. In particular, MAIRA-1 significantly improves on the radiologist-aligned RadCliQ metric and across all lexical metrics considered. Manual review of model outputs demonstrates promising fluency and accuracy of generated reports while uncovering failure modes not captured by existing evaluation practices. More information and resources can be found on the project website: https://aka.ms/maira.</description>

      <title>Conditional Variational Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-costly and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.</description>

      <title>Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.</description>

      <title>3D-LFM: Lifting Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lifting of 3D structure and camera from 2D landmarks is at the cornerstone of the entire discipline of computer vision. Traditional methods have been confined to specific rigid objects, such as those in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems, but deep learning has expanded our capability to reconstruct a wide range of object classes (e.g. C3DPO and PAUL) with resilience to noise, occlusions, and perspective distortions. All these techniques, however, have been limited by the fundamental need to establish correspondences across the 3D training data -- significantly limiting their utility to applications where one has an abundance of "in-correspondence" 3D data. Our approach harnesses the inherent permutation equivariance of transformers to manage varying number of points per 3D data instance, withstands occlusions, and generalizes to unseen categories. We demonstrate state of the art performance across 2D-3D lifting task benchmarks. Since our approach can be trained across such a broad class of structures we refer to it simply as a 3D Lifting Foundation Model (3D-LFM) -- the first of its kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17163v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by human driving focus, this research pioneers networks augmented with Focusing Sampling, Partial Field of View Evaluation, Enhanced FPN architecture and Directional IoU Loss - targeted innovations addressing obstacles to precise lane detection for autonomous driving. Experiments demonstrate our Focusing Sampling strategy, emphasizing vital distant details unlike uniform approaches, significantly boosts both benchmark and practical curved/distant lane recognition accuracy essential for safety. While FENetV1 achieves state-of-the-art conventional metric performance via enhancements isolating perspective-aware contexts mimicking driver vision, FENetV2 proves most reliable on the proposed Partial Field analysis. Hence we specifically recommend V2 for practical lane navigation despite fractional degradation on standard entire-image measures. Future directions include collecting on-road data and integrating complementary dual frameworks to further breakthroughs guided by human perception principles.

      <description>arXiv:2401.01373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defect detection is one of the most important yet challenging tasks in the quality control stage in the manufacturing sector. In this work, we introduce a Tensor Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) and examine its performance on a real defect detection application in one of the components of the ultrasonic sensors produced at Robert Bosch's manufacturing plants. Our quantum-inspired T-CNN operates on a reduced model parameter space to substantially improve the training speed and performance of an equivalent CNN model without sacrificing accuracy. More specifically, we demonstrate how T-CNNs are able to reach the same performance as classical CNNs as measured by quality metrics, with up to fifteen times fewer parameters and 4% to 19% faster training times. Our results demonstrate that the T-CNN greatly outperforms the results of traditional human visual inspection, providing value in a current real application in manufacturing.</description>

Abstract: State-of-the-art models on contemporary 3D segmentation benchmarks like ScanNet consume and label dataset-provided 3D point clouds, obtained through post processing of sensed multiview RGB-D images. They are typically trained in-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that featurize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performance between methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds has fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model architectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN (Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and label both 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture that alternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion. Our model differentiates 2D and 3D feature operations through the positional encodings of the tokens involved, which capture pixel coordinates for 2D patch tokens and 3D coordinates for 3D feature tokens. ODIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet200, Matterport3D and AI2THOR 3D instance segmentation benchmarks, and competitive performance on ScanNet, S3DIS and COCO. It outperforms all previous works by a wide margin when the sensed 3D point cloud is used in place of the point cloud sampled from 3D mesh. When used as the 3D perception engine in an instructable embodied agent architecture, it sets a new state-of-the-art on the TEACh action-from-dialogue benchmark.

      <title>PythonSaga: Redefining the Benchmark to Evaluate Code Generating LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by the surge in code generation using large language models (LLMs), numerous benchmarks have emerged to evaluate these LLMs capabilities. We conducted a large-scale human evaluation of HumanEval and MBPP, two popular benchmarks for Python code generation, analyzing their diversity and difficulty. Our findings unveil a critical bias towards a limited set of programming concepts, neglecting most of the other concepts entirely. Furthermore, we uncover a worrying prevalence of easy tasks, potentially inflating model performance estimations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel benchmark, PythonSaga, featuring 185 hand-crafted prompts on a balanced representation of 38 programming concepts across diverse difficulty levels.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Gaussian Contrastive Grounding with Large Multimodal Models for Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on the information observed in videos. Despite the recent success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in image-language understanding and reasoning, they deal with VideoQA insufficiently, by simply taking uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs, which ignores question-relevant visual clues. Moreover, there are no human annotations for question-critical timestamps in existing VideoQA datasets. In light of this, we propose a novel weakly supervised framework to enforce the LMMs to reason out the answers with question-critical moments as visual inputs. Specifically, we first fuse the question and answer pairs as event descriptions to find multiple keyframes as target moments and pseudo-labels, with the visual-language alignment capability of the CLIP models. With these pseudo-labeled keyframes as additionally weak supervision, we devise a lightweight Gaussian-based Contrastive Grounding (GCG) module. GCG learns multiple Gaussian functions to characterize the temporal structure of the video, and sample question-critical frames as positive moments to be the visual inputs of LMMs. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our framework, and we achieve substantial improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Learning to Visually Connect Actions and their Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the novel concept of visually Connecting Actions and Their Effects (CATE) in video understanding. CATE can have applications in areas like task planning and learning from demonstration. We identify and explore two different aspects of the concept of CATE: Action Selection and Effect-Affinity Assessment, where video understanding models connect actions and effects at semantic and fine-grained levels, respectively. We observe that different formulations produce representations capturing intuitive action properties. We also design various baseline models for Action Selection and Effect-Affinity Assessment. Despite the intuitive nature of the task, we observe that models struggle, and humans outperform them by a large margin. The study aims to establish a foundation for future efforts, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of connecting actions and effects in video understanding, with the hope of inspiring advanced formulations and models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Fairness of Image Upsampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of deep generative models for creating synthetic media, such as images and videos. While the practical applications of these models in everyday tasks are enticing, it is crucial to assess the inherent risks regarding their fairness. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking the performance and fairness of conditional generative models. We develop a set of metrics$\unicode{x2013}$inspired by their supervised fairness counterparts$\unicode{x2013}$to evaluate the models on their fairness and diversity. Focusing on the specific application of image upsampling, we create a benchmark covering a wide variety of modern upsampling methods. As part of the benchmark, we introduce UnfairFace, a subset of FairFace that replicates the racial distribution of common large-scale face datasets. Our empirical study highlights the importance of using an unbiased training set and reveals variations in how the algorithms respond to dataset imbalances. Alarmingly, we find that none of the considered methods produces statistically fair and diverse results. All experiments can be reproduced using our provided repository.</description>

      <title>Distilling Privileged Multimodal Information for Expression Recognition using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models for multimodal expression recognition have reached remarkable performance in controlled laboratory environments because of their ability to learn complementary and redundant semantic information. However, these models struggle in the wild, mainly because of the unavailability and quality of modalities used for training. In practice, only a subset of the training-time modalities may be available at test time. Learning with privileged information enables models to exploit data from additional modalities that are only available during training. State-of-the-art knowledge distillation (KD) methods have been proposed to distill information from multiple teacher models (each trained on a modality) to a common student model. These privileged KD methods typically utilize point-to-point matching, yet have no explicit mechanism to capture the structural information in the teacher representation space formed by introducing the privileged modality. Experiments were performed on two challenging problems - pain estimation on the Biovid dataset (ordinal classification) and arousal-valance prediction on the Affwild2 dataset (regression). Results show that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art privileged KD methods on these problems. The diversity among modalities and fusion architectures indicates that PKDOT is modality- and model-agnostic.</description>

      <title>A Linguistic Comparison between Human and ChatGPT-Generated Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores linguistic differences between human and LLM-generated dialogues, using 19.5K dialogues generated by ChatGPT-3.5 as a companion to the EmpathicDialogues dataset. The research employs Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis, comparing ChatGPT-generated conversations with human conversations across 118 linguistic categories. Results show greater variability and authenticity in human dialogues, but ChatGPT excels in categories such as social processes, analytical style, cognition, attentional focus, and positive emotional tone, reinforcing recent findings of LLMs being "more human than human." However, no significant difference was found in positive or negative affect between ChatGPT and human dialogues. Classifier analysis of dialogue embeddings indicates implicit coding of the valence of affect despite no explicit mention of affect in the conversations. The research also contributes a novel, companion ChatGPT-generated dataset of conversations between two independent chatbots, which were designed to replicate a corpus of human conversations available for open access and used widely in AI research on language modeling. Our findings enhance understanding of ChatGPT's linguistic capabilities and inform ongoing efforts to distinguish between human and LLM-generated text, which is critical in detecting AI-generated fakes, misinformation, and disinformation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer in Content Moderation: The Human-AI Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Successful content moderation in online platforms relies on a human-AI collaboration approach. A typical heuristic estimates the expected harmfulness of a post and uses fixed thresholds to decide whether to remove it and whether to send it for human review. This disregards the prediction uncertainty, the time-varying element of human review capacity and post arrivals, and the selective sampling in the dataset (humans only review posts filtered by the admission algorithm).
  In this paper, we introduce a model to capture the human-AI interplay in content moderation. The algorithm observes contextual information for incoming posts, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules posts for human review. Only admitted posts receive human reviews on their harmfulness. These reviews help educate the machine-learning algorithms but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. The classical learning-theoretic way to capture this human-AI interplay is via the framework of learning to defer, where the algorithm has the option to defer a classification task to humans for a fixed cost and immediately receive feedback. Our model contributes to this literature by introducing congestion in the human review system. Moreover, unlike work on online learning with delayed feedback where the delay in the feedback is exogenous to the algorithm's decisions, the delay in our model is endogenous to both the admission and the scheduling decisions.
  We propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems and hence our analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Comparing Specialised Small and General Large Language Models on Text Classification: 100 Labelled Samples to Achieve Break-Even Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When solving NLP tasks with limited labelled data, researchers can either use a general large language model without further update, or use a small number of labelled examples to tune a specialised smaller model. In this work, we address the research gap of how many labelled samples are required for the specialised small models to outperform general large models, while taking the performance variance into consideration. By observing the behaviour of fine-tuning, instruction-tuning, prompting and in-context learning on 7 language models, we identify such performance break-even points across 8 representative text classification tasks of varying characteristics. We show that the specialised models often need only few samples (on average $10 - 1000$) to be on par or better than the general ones. At the same time, the number of required labels strongly depends on the dataset or task characteristics, with this number being significantly lower on multi-class datasets (up to $100$) than on binary datasets (up to $5000$). When performance variance is taken into consideration, the number of required labels increases on average by $100 - 200\%$ and even up to $1500\%$ in specific cases.</description>

      <title>Rethinking The Uniformity Metric in Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniformity plays an important role in evaluating learned representations, providing insights into self-supervised learning. In our quest for effective uniformity metrics, we pinpoint four principled properties that such metrics should possess. Namely, an effective uniformity metric should remain invariant to instance permutations and sample replications while accurately capturing feature redundancy and dimensional collapse. Surprisingly, we find that the uniformity metric proposed by \citet{Wang2020UnderstandingCR} fails to satisfy the majority of these properties. Specifically, their metric is sensitive to sample replications, and can not account for feature redundancy and dimensional collapse correctly. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new uniformity metric based on the Wasserstein distance, which satisfies all the aforementioned properties. Integrating this new metric in existing self-supervised learning methods effectively mitigates dimensional collapse and consistently improves their performance on downstream tasks involving CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/statsle/WassersteinSSL}.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Learnable Planners for Long-Term Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning for both immediate and long-term benefits becomes increasingly important in recommendation. Existing methods apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn planning capacity by maximizing cumulative reward for long-term recommendation. However, the scarcity of recommendation data presents challenges such as instability and susceptibility to overfitting when training RL models from scratch, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this light, we propose to leverage the remarkable planning capabilities over sparse data of Large Language Models (LLMs) for long-term recommendation. The key to achieving the target lies in formulating a guidance plan following principles of enhancing long-term engagement and grounding the plan to effective and executable actions in a personalized manner. To this end, we propose a Bi-level Learnable LLM Planner framework, which consists of a set of LLM instances and breaks down the learning process into macro-learning and micro-learning to learn macro-level guidance and micro-level personalized recommendation policies, respectively. Extensive experiments validate that the framework facilitates the planning ability of LLMs for long-term recommendation. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/jizhi-zhang/BiLLP.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Models to Support Real-World Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) carry the potential to support humans in processing vast amounts of information. While MLLMs are already being used as a fact-checking tool, their abilities and limitations in this regard are understudied. Here is aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we propose a framework for systematically assessing the capacity of current multimodal models to facilitate real-world fact-checking. Our methodology is evidence-free, leveraging only these models' intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. By designing prompts that extract models' predictions, explanations, and confidence levels, we delve into research questions concerning model accuracy, robustness, and reasons for failure. We empirically find that (1) GPT-4V exhibits superior performance in identifying malicious and misleading multimodal claims, with the ability to explain the unreasonable aspects and underlying motives, and (2) existing open-source models exhibit strong biases and are highly sensitive to the prompt. Our study offers insights into combating false multimodal information and building secure, trustworthy multimodal models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate MLLMs for real-world fact-checking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information pooling has been extensively formalised across various logical frameworks in distributed systems, characterized by diverse information-sharing patterns. These approaches generally adopt an intersection perspective, aggregating all possible information, regardless of whether it is known or unknown to the agents. In contrast, this work adopts a unique stance, emphasising that sharing knowledge means distributing what is known, rather than what remains uncertain. This paper introduces new modal logics for knowledge pooling and sharing, ranging from a novel language of knowledge pooling to a dynamic mechanism for knowledge sharing. It also outlines their axiomatizations and discusses a potential framework for permissible knowledge pooling.</description>

      <title>Panoptic Perception: A Novel Task and Fine-grained Dataset for Universal Remote Sensing Image Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current remote-sensing interpretation models often focus on a single task such as detection, segmentation, or caption. However, the task-specific designed models are unattainable to achieve the comprehensive multi-level interpretation of images. The field also lacks support for multi-task joint interpretation datasets. In this paper, we propose Panoptic Perception, a novel task and a new fine-grained dataset (FineGrip) to achieve a more thorough and universal interpretation for RSIs. The new task, 1) integrates pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level information for universal image perception, 2) captures image information from coarse to fine granularity, achieving deeper scene understanding and description, and 3) enables various independent tasks to complement and enhance each other through multi-task learning. By emphasizing multi-task interactions and the consistency of perception results, this task enables the simultaneous processing of fine-grained foreground instance segmentation, background semantic segmentation, and global fine-grained image captioning. Concretely, the FineGrip dataset includes 2,649 remote sensing images, 12,054 fine-grained instance segmentation masks belonging to 20 foreground things categories, 7,599 background semantic masks for 5 stuff classes and 13,245 captioning sentences. Furthermore, we propose a joint optimization-based panoptic perception model. Experimental results on FineGrip demonstrate the feasibility of the panoptic perception task and the beneficial effect of multi-task joint optimization on individual tasks. The dataset will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>FedTrans: Efficient Federated Learning via Multi-Model Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) aims to train machine learning (ML) models across potentially millions of edge client devices. Yet, training and customizing models for FL clients is notoriously challenging due to the heterogeneity of client data, device capabilities, and the massive scale of clients, making individualized model exploration prohibitively expensive. State-of-the-art FL solutions personalize a globally trained model or concurrently train multiple models, but they often incur suboptimal model accuracy and huge training costs.
  In this paper, we introduce FedTrans, a multi-model FL training framework that automatically produces and trains high-accuracy, hardware-compatible models for individual clients at scale. FedTrans begins with a basic global model, identifies accuracy bottlenecks in model architectures during training, and then employs model transformation to derive new models for heterogeneous clients on the fly. It judiciously assigns models to individual clients while performing soft aggregation on multi-model updates to minimize total training costs. Our evaluations using realistic settings show that FedTrans improves individual client model accuracy by 14% - 72% while slashing training costs by 1.6X - 20X over state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Bt-GAN: Generating Fair Synthetic Healthdata via Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to enhance the usefulness of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) by generating realistic de-identified data. However, the existing literature primarily focuses on the quality of synthetic health data, neglecting the crucial aspect of fairness in downstream predictions. Consequently, models trained on synthetic EHR have faced criticism for producing biased outcomes in target tasks. These biases can arise from either spurious correlations between features or the failure of models to accurately represent sub-groups. To address these concerns, we present Bias-transforming Generative Adversarial Networks (Bt-GAN), a GAN-based synthetic data generator specifically designed for the healthcare domain. In order to tackle spurious correlations (i), we propose an information-constrained Data Generation Process that enables the generator to learn a fair deterministic transformation based on a well-defined notion of algorithmic fairness. To overcome the challenge of capturing exact sub-group representations (ii), we incentivize the generator to preserve sub-group densities through score-based weighted sampling. This approach compels the generator to learn from underrepresented regions of the data manifold. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMIC-III database. Our results demonstrate that Bt-GAN achieves SOTA accuracy while significantly improving fairness and minimizing bias amplification. We also perform an in-depth explainability analysis to provide additional evidence supporting the validity of our study. In conclusion, our research introduces a novel and professional approach to addressing the limitations of synthetic data generation in the healthcare domain. By incorporating fairness considerations and leveraging advanced techniques such as GANs, we pave the way for more reliable and unbiased predictions in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>CT-GLIP: 3D Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT Scans and Radiology Reports for Full-Body Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (Med-VLP) establishes a connection between visual content from medical images and the relevant textual descriptions. Existing Med-VLP methods primarily focus on 2D images depicting a single body part, notably chest X-rays. In this paper, we extend the scope of Med-VLP to encompass 3D images, specifically targeting full-body scenarios, by using a multimodal dataset of CT images and reports. Compared with the 2D counterpart, 3D VLP is required to effectively capture essential semantics from significantly sparser representation in 3D imaging. In this paper, we introduce CT-GLIP (Grounded Language-Image Pretraining with CT scans), a novel method that constructs organ-level image-text pairs to enhance multimodal contrastive learning, aligning grounded visual features with precise diagnostic text. Additionally, we developed an abnormality dictionary to augment contrastive learning with diverse contrastive pairs. Our method, trained on a multimodal CT dataset comprising 44,011 organ-level vision-text pairs from 17,702 patients across 104 organs, demonstrates it can identify organs and abnormalities in a zero-shot manner using natural languages. The performance of CT-GLIP is validated on a separate test set of 1,130 patients, focusing on the 16 most frequent abnormalities across 7 organs. The experimental results show our model's superior performance over the standard CLIP framework across zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios, using both CNN and ViT architectures.</description>

      <title>The Power of Resets in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulators are a pervasive tool in reinforcement learning, but most existing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit simulator access -- particularly in high-dimensional domains that require general function approximation. We explore the power of simulators through online reinforcement learning with {local simulator access} (or, local planning), an RL protocol where the agent is allowed to reset to previously observed states and follow their dynamics during training. We use local simulator access to unlock new statistical guarantees that were previously out of reach:
  - We show that MDPs with low coverability (Xie et al. 2023) -- a general structural condition that subsumes Block MDPs and Low-Rank MDPs -- can be learned in a sample-efficient fashion with only $Q^{\star}$-realizability (realizability of the optimal state-value function); existing online RL algorithms require significantly stronger representation conditions.
  - As a consequence, we show that the notorious Exogenous Block MDP problem (Efroni et al. 2022) is tractable under local simulator access.
  The results above are achieved through a computationally inefficient algorithm. We complement them with a more computationally efficient algorithm, RVFS (Recursive Value Function Search), which achieves provable sample complexity guarantees under a strengthened statistical assumption known as pushforward coverability. RVFS can be viewed as a principled, provable counterpart to a successful empirical paradigm that combines recursive search (e.g., MCTS) with value function approximation.</description>

      <title>ToM-LM: Delegating Theory of Mind Reasoning to External Symbolic Executors in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability of individuals to attribute mental states to others. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown some promise with ToM ability, they still struggle with complex ToM reasoning. Our approach leverages an external symbolic executor, specifically the SMCDEL model checker, and fine-tuning to improve the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs. In our approach, an LLM is first fine-tuned through pairs of natural language and symbolic formulation representation of ToM problems and is then instructed to generate the symbolic formulation with a one-shot in-context example. The generated symbolic formulation is then executed by the SMCDEL model checker to perform transparent and verifiable ToM reasoning and give the final result. We demonstrate that our approach, ToM-LM, shows a significant improvement over all the constructed baselines. Our study proposes a novel view about externalizing a particular component of ToM reasoning, mainly reasoning about beliefs, and suggests generalizing it to other aspects of ToM reasoning.</description>

      <title>The Promise and Challenges of Using LLMs to Accelerate the Screening Process of Systematic Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic review (SR) is a popular research method in software engineering (SE). However, conducting an SR takes an average of 67 weeks. Thus, automating any step of the SR process could reduce the effort associated with SRs. Our objective is to investigate if Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate title-abstract screening by simplifying abstracts for human screeners, and automating title-abstract screening. We performed an experiment where humans screened titles and abstracts for 20 papers with both original and simplified abstracts from a prior SR. The experiment with human screeners was reproduced with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs to perform the same screening tasks. We also studied if different prompting techniques (Zero-shot (ZS), One-shot (OS), Few-shot (FS), and Few-shot with Chain-of-Thought (FS-CoT)) improve the screening performance of LLMs. Lastly, we studied if redesigning the prompt used in the LLM reproduction of screening leads to improved performance. Text simplification did not increase the screeners' screening performance, but reduced the time used in screening. Screeners' scientific literacy skills and researcher status predict screening performance. Some LLM and prompt combinations perform as well as human screeners in the screening tasks. Our results indicate that the GPT-4 LLM is better than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. Additionally, Few-shot and One-shot prompting outperforms Zero-shot prompting. Using LLMs for text simplification in the screening process does not significantly improve human performance. Using LLMs to automate title-abstract screening seems promising, but current LLMs are not significantly more accurate than human screeners. To recommend the use of LLMs in the screening process of SRs, more research is needed. We recommend future SR studies publish replication packages with screening data to enable more conclusive experimenting with LLM screening.</description>

      <title>Retrieval and Distill: A Temporal Data Shift-Free Paradigm for Online Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current recommendation systems are significantly affected by a serious issue of temporal data shift, which is the inconsistency between the distribution of historical data and that of online data. Most existing models focus on utilizing updated data, overlooking the transferable, temporal data shift-free information that can be learned from shifting data. We propose the Temporal Invariance of Association theorem, which suggests that given a fixed search space, the relationship between the data and the data in the search space keeps invariant over time. Leveraging this principle, we designed a retrieval-based recommendation system framework that can train a data shift-free relevance network using shifting data, significantly enhancing the predictive performance of the original model in the recommendation system. However, retrieval-based recommendation models face substantial inference time costs when deployed online. To address this, we further designed a distill framework that can distill information from the relevance network into a parameterized module using shifting data. The distilled model can be deployed online alongside the original model, with only a minimal increase in inference time. Extensive experiments on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the performance of the original model by utilizing shifting data.</description>

      <title>A General Black-box Adversarial Attack on Graph-based Fake News Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based fake news detectors apply various methods to construct graphs, aiming to learn distinctive news embeddings for classification. Since the construction details are unknown for attackers in a black-box scenario, it is unrealistic to conduct the classical adversarial attacks that require a specific adjacency matrix. In this paper, we propose the first general black-box adversarial attack framework, i.e., General Attack via Fake Social Interaction (GAFSI), against detectors based on different graph structures. Specifically, as sharing is an important social interaction for GNN-based fake news detectors to construct the graph, we simulate sharing behaviors to fool the detectors. Firstly, we propose a fraudster selection module to select engaged users leveraging local and global information. In addition, a post injection module guides the selected users to create shared relations by sending posts. The sharing records will be added to the social context, leading to a general attack against different detectors. Experimental results on empirical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GAFSI.</description>

      <title>How explainable AI affects human performance: A systematic review of the behavioural consequences of saliency maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Saliency maps can explain how deep neural networks classify images. But are they actually useful for humans? The present systematic review of 68 user studies found that while saliency maps can enhance human performance, null effects or even costs are quite common. To investigate what modulates these effects, the empirical outcomes were organised along several factors related to the human tasks, AI performance, XAI methods, images to be classified, human participants and comparison conditions. In image-focused tasks, benefits were less common than in AI-focused tasks, but the effects depended on the specific cognitive requirements. Moreover, benefits were usually restricted to incorrect AI predictions in AI-focused tasks but to correct ones in image-focused tasks. XAI-related factors had surprisingly little impact. The evidence was limited for image- and human-related factors and the effects were highly dependent on the comparison conditions. These findings may support the design of future user studies.</description>

      <title>Classifying Human-Generated and AI-Generated Election Claims in Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Politics is one of the most prevalent topics discussed on social media platforms, particularly during major election cycles, where users engage in conversations about candidates and electoral processes. Malicious actors may use this opportunity to disseminate misinformation to undermine trust in the electoral process. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) exacerbates this issue by enabling malicious actors to generate misinformation at an unprecedented scale. Artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content is often indistinguishable from authentic user content, raising concerns about the integrity of information on social networks. In this paper, we present a novel taxonomy for characterizing election-related claims. This taxonomy provides an instrument for analyzing election-related claims, with granular categories related to jurisdiction, equipment, processes, and the nature of claims. We introduce ElectAI, a novel benchmark dataset that consists of 9,900 tweets, each labeled as human- or AI-generated. For AI-generated tweets, the specific LLM variant that produced them is specified. We annotated a subset of 1,550 tweets using the proposed taxonomy to capture the characteristics of election-related claims. We explored the capabilities of LLMs in extracting the taxonomy attributes and trained various machine learning models using ElectAI to distinguish between human- and AI-generated posts and identify the specific LLM variant.</description>

      <title>Investigating the prompt leakage effect and black-box defenses for multi-turn LLM interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt leakage in large language models (LLMs) poses a significant security and privacy threat, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, leakage in multi-turn LLM interactions along with mitigation strategies has not been studied in a standardized manner. This paper investigates LLM vulnerabilities against prompt leakage across 4 diverse domains and 10 closed- and open-source LLMs. Our unique multi-turn threat model leverages the LLM's sycophancy effect and our analysis dissects task instruction and knowledge leakage in the LLM response. In a multi-turn setting, our threat model elevates the average attack success rate (ASR) to 86.2%, including a 99% leakage with GPT-4 and claude-1.3. We find that some black-box LLMs like Gemini show variable susceptibility to leakage across domains - they are more likely to leak contextual knowledge in the news domain compared to the medical domain. Our experiments measure specific effects of 6 black-box defense strategies, including a query-rewriter in the RAG scenario. Our proposed multi-tier combination of defenses still has an ASR of 5.3% for black-box LLMs, indicating room for enhancement and future direction for LLM security research.</description>

Abstract: With the development and widespread application of digital image processing technology, image splicing has become a common method of image manipulation, raising numerous security and legal issues. This paper introduces a new splicing image detection algorithm based on the statistical characteristics of natural images, aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of splicing image detection. By analyzing the limitations of traditional methods, we have developed a detection framework that integrates advanced statistical analysis techniques and machine learning methods. The algorithm has been validated using multiple public datasets, showing high accuracy in detecting spliced edges and locating tampered areas, as well as good robustness. Additionally, we explore the potential applications and challenges faced by the algorithm in real-world scenarios. This research not only provides an effective technological means for the field of image tampering detection but also offers new ideas and methods for future related research.</description>

      <title>Formal Specification, Assessment, and Enforcement of Fairness for Generative AIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcing or even exacerbating societal biases and inequalities will increase significantly as generative AI increasingly produces useful artifacts, from text to images and beyond, for the real world. We address these issues by formally characterizing the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness using the notion of infinite sequences of abstractions of AI-generated artifacts such as text or images. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is evaluated only on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts and models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement. Finally, fairness monitoring and enforcement are tested against some current generative AI models.</description>

      <title>Redefining Safety for Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing definitions and associated conceptual frameworks for computer-based system safety should be revisited in light of real-world experiences from deploying autonomous vehicles. Current terminology used by industry safety standards emphasizes mitigation of risk from specifically identified hazards, and carries assumptions based on human-supervised vehicle operation. Operation without a human driver dramatically increases the scope of safety concerns, especially due to operation in an open world environment, a requirement to self-enforce operational limits, participation in an ad hoc sociotechnical system of systems, and a requirement to conform to both legal and ethical constraints. Existing standards and terminology only partially address these new challenges. We propose updated definitions for core system safety concepts that encompass these additional considerations as a starting point for evolving safe-ty approaches to address these additional safety challenges. These results might additionally inform framing safety terminology for other autonomous system applications.</description>

      <title>Make Your LLM Fully Utilize the Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many contemporary large language models (LLMs) can process lengthy input, they still struggle to fully utilize information within the long context, known as the lost-in-the-middle challenge. We hypothesize that it stems from insufficient explicit supervision during the long-context training, which fails to emphasize that any position in a long context can hold crucial information. Based on this intuition, our study presents information-intensive (IN2) training, a purely data-driven solution to overcome lost-in-the-middle. Specifically, IN2 training leverages a synthesized long-context question-answer dataset, where the answer requires (1) fine-grained information awareness on a short segment (~128 tokens) within a synthesized long context (4K-32K tokens), and (2) the integration and reasoning of information from two or more short segments. Through applying this information-intensive training on Mistral-7B, we present FILM-7B (FILl-in-the-Middle). To thoroughly assess the ability of FILM-7B for utilizing long contexts, we design three probing tasks that encompass various context styles (document, code, and structured-data context) and information retrieval patterns (forward, backward, and bi-directional retrieval). The probing results demonstrate that FILM-7B can robustly retrieve information from different positions in its 32K context window. Beyond these probing tasks, FILM-7B significantly improves the performance on real-world long-context tasks (e.g., 23.5-&gt;26.9 F1 score on NarrativeQA), while maintaining a comparable performance on short-context tasks (e.g., 59.3-&gt;59.2 accuracy on MMLU).
