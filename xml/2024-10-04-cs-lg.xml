      <title>ACEV: Unsupervised Intersecting Manifold Segmentation using Adaptation to Angular Change of Eigenvectors in Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersecting manifold segmentation has been a focus of research, where individual manifolds, that intersect with other manifolds, are separated to discover their distinct properties. The proposed method is based on the intuition that when a manifold in $D$ dimensional space with an intrinsic dimension of $d$ intersects with another manifold, the data variance grows in more than $d$ directions. The proposed method measures local data variances and determines their vector directions. It counts the number of vectors with non-zero variance, which determines the manifold's intrinsic dimension. For detection of the intersection region, the method adapts to the changes in the angular gaps between the corresponding direction vectors of the child and parent using exponential moving averages using a tree structure construction. Accordingly, it includes those data points in the same manifold whose neighborhood is within the adaptive angular difference and eventually identifies the data points in the intersection area of manifolds. Data points whose inclusion in the neighborhood-identified data points increases their intrinsic dimensionality are removed based on data variance and distance. The proposed method performs better than 18 SOTA manifold segmentation methods in ARI and NMI scores over 14 real-world datasets with lesser time complexity and better stability.</description>

      <title>MoS: Unleashing Parameter Efficiency of Low-Rank Adaptation with Mixture of Shards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models necessitates more lightweight finetuning methods to reduce the explosive GPU memory overhead when numerous customized models are served simultaneously. Targeting more parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), parameter sharing presents a promising solution. Empirically, our research into high-level sharing principles highlights the indispensable role of differentiation in reversing the detrimental effects of pure sharing. Guided by this finding, we propose Mixture of Shards (MoS), incorporating both inter-layer and intra-layer sharing schemes, and integrating four nearly cost-free differentiation strategies, namely subset selection, pair dissociation, vector sharding, and shard privatization. Briefly, it selects a designated number of shards from global pools with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-like routing mechanism before sequentially concatenating them to low-rank matrices. Hence, it retains all the advantages of LoRA while offering enhanced parameter efficiency, and effectively circumvents the drawbacks of peer parameter-sharing methods. Our empirical experiments demonstrate approximately 8x parameter savings in a standard LoRA setting. The ablation study confirms the significance of each component. Our insights into parameter sharing and MoS method may illuminate future developments of more parameter-efficient finetuning methods.</description>

      <title>RisingBALLER: A player is a token, a match is a sentence, A path towards a foundational model for football players data analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I introduce RisingBALLER, the first publicly available approach that leverages a transformer model trained on football match data to learn match-specific player representations. Drawing inspiration from advances in language modeling, RisingBALLER treats each football match as a unique sequence in which players serve as tokens, with their embeddings shaped by the specific context of the match. Through the use of masked player prediction (MPP) as a pre-training task, RisingBALLER learns foundational features for football player representations, similar to how language models learn semantic features for text representations. As a downstream task, I introduce next match statistics prediction (NMSP) to showcase the effectiveness of the learned player embeddings. The NMSP model surpasses a strong baseline commonly used for performance forecasting within the community. Furthermore, I conduct an in-depth analysis to demonstrate how the learned embeddings by RisingBALLER can be used in various football analytics tasks, such as producing meaningful positional features that capture the essence and variety of player roles beyond rigid x,y coordinates, team cohesion estimation, and similar player retrieval for more effective data-driven scouting. More than a simple machine learning model, RisingBALLER is a comprehensive framework designed to transform football data analytics by learning high-level foundational features for players, taking into account the context of each match. It offers a deeper understanding of football players beyond individual statistics.</description>

      <title>Robust Guided Diffusion for Offline Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline black-box optimization aims to maximize a black-box function using an offline dataset of designs and their measured properties. Two main approaches have emerged: the forward approach, which learns a mapping from input to its value, thereby acting as a proxy to guide optimization, and the inverse approach, which learns a mapping from value to input for conditional generation. (a) Although proxy-free~(classifier-free) diffusion shows promise in robustly modeling the inverse mapping, it lacks explicit guidance from proxies, essential for generating high-performance samples beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we propose \textit{proxy-enhanced sampling} which utilizes the explicit guidance from a trained proxy to bolster proxy-free diffusion with enhanced sampling control. (b) Yet, the trained proxy is susceptible to out-of-distribution issues. To address this, we devise the module \textit{diffusion-based proxy refinement}, which seamlessly integrates insights from proxy-free diffusion back into the proxy for refinement. To sum up, we propose \textit{\textbf{R}obust \textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}iffusion for Offline Black-box Optimization}~(\textbf{RGD}), combining the advantages of proxy~(explicit guidance) and proxy-free diffusion~(robustness) for effective conditional generation. RGD achieves state-of-the-art results on various design-bench tasks, underscoring its efficacy. Our code is at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RGD-27A5/README.md.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-off in a Hierarchy of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Extreme Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When performing predictions that use Machine Learning (ML), we are mainly interested in performance and interpretability. This generates a natural trade-off, where complex models generally have higher skills but are harder to explain and thus trust. Interpretability is particularly important in the climate community, where we aim at gaining a physical understanding of the underlying phenomena. Even more so when the prediction concerns extreme weather events with high impact on society. In this paper, we perform probabilistic forecasts of extreme heatwaves over France, using a hierarchy of increasingly complex ML models, which allows us to find the best compromise between accuracy and interpretability. More precisely, we use models that range from a global Gaussian Approximation (GA) to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with the intermediate steps of a simple Intrinsically Interpretable Neural Network (IINN) and a model using the Scattering Transform (ScatNet). Our findings reveal that CNNs provide higher accuracy, but their black-box nature severely limits interpretability, even when using state-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools. In contrast, ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency, identifying key scales and patterns in the data that drive predictions. This study underscores the potential of interpretability in ML models for climate science, demonstrating that simpler models can rival the performance of their more complex counterparts, all the while being much easier to understand. This gained interpretability is crucial for building trust in model predictions and uncovering new scientific insights, ultimately advancing our understanding and management of extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Tight Rates for Bandit Control Beyond Quadratics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classical control theory, such as Linear Quadratic Control (LQC), real-world control problems are highly complex. These problems often involve adversarial perturbations, bandit feedback models, and non-quadratic, adversarially chosen cost functions. A fundamental yet unresolved question is whether optimal regret can be achieved for these general control problems. The standard approach to addressing this problem involves a reduction to bandit convex optimization with memory. In the bandit setting, constructing a gradient estimator with low variance is challenging due to the memory structure and non-quadratic loss functions.
  In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Our main contribution is an algorithm that achieves an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ optimal regret for bandit non-stochastic control with strongly-convex and smooth cost functions in the presence of adversarial perturbations, improving the previously known $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound from (Cassel and Koren, 2020. Our algorithm overcomes the memory issue by reducing the problem to Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) without memory and addresses general strongly-convex costs using recent advancements in BCO from (Suggala et al., 2024). Along the way, we develop an improved algorithm for BCO with memory, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>CktGen: Specification-Conditioned Analog Circuit Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic synthesis of analog circuits presents significant challenges. Existing methods usually treat the task as optimization problems, which limits their transferability and reusability for new requirements. To address this limitation, we introduce a task that directly generates analog circuits based on specified specifications, termed specification-conditioned analog circuit generation. Specifically, we propose CktGen, a simple yet effective variational autoencoder (VAE) model, that maps specifications and circuits into a joint latent space, and reconstructs the circuit from the latent. Moreover, given that a single specification can correspond to multiple distinct circuits, simply minimizing the distance between the mapped latent representations of the circuit and specification does not capture these one-to-many relationships. To address this, we integrate contrastive learning and classifier guidance to prevent model collapse. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the Open Circuit Benchmark (OCB) and introduce new evaluation metrics for cross-model consistency in the specification-to-circuit generation task. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Back to Bayesics: Uncovering Human Mobility Distributions and Anomalies with an Integrated Statistical and Neural Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for anomaly detection often fall short due to their inability to handle the complexity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality inherent in real-world mobility data. In this paper, we propose DeepBayesic, a novel framework that integrates Bayesian principles with deep neural networks to model the underlying multivariate distributions from sparse and complex datasets. Unlike traditional models, DeepBayesic is designed to manage heterogeneous inputs, accommodating both continuous and categorical data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. The framework features customized neural density estimators and hybrid architectures, allowing for flexibility in modeling diverse feature distributions and enabling the use of specialized neural networks tailored to different data types. Our approach also leverages agent embeddings for personalized anomaly detection, enhancing its ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors for individual agents. We evaluate our approach on several mobility datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our results indicate that incorporating personalization and advanced sequence modeling techniques can substantially enhance the ability to detect subtle and complex anomalies in spatiotemporal event sequences.</description>

      <title>GPTreeO: An R package for continual regression with dividing local Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GPTreeO, a flexible R package for scalable Gaussian process (GP) regression, particularly tailored to continual learning problems. GPTreeO builds upon the Dividing Local Gaussian Processes (DLGP) algorithm, in which a binary tree of local GP regressors is dynamically constructed using a continual stream of input data. In GPTreeO we extend the original DLGP algorithm by allowing continual optimisation of the GP hyperparameters, incorporating uncertainty calibration, and introducing new strategies for how the local partitions are created. Moreover, the modular code structure allows users to interface their favourite GP library to perform the local GP regression in GPTreeO. The flexibility of GPTreeO gives the user fine-grained control of the balance between computational speed, accuracy, stability and smoothness. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to show how GPTreeO's configurable features impact the regression performance in a continual learning setting.</description>

      <title>Don't Stop Me Now: Embedding Based Scheduling for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient scheduling is crucial for interactive Large Language Model (LLM) applications, where low request completion time directly impacts user engagement. Size-based scheduling algorithms like Shortest Remaining Process Time (SRPT) aim to reduce average request completion time by leveraging known or estimated request sizes and allowing preemption by incoming jobs with shorter service times. However, two main challenges arise when applying size-based scheduling to LLM systems. First, accurately predicting output lengths from prompts is challenging and often resource-intensive, making it impractical for many systems. As a result, the state-of-the-art LLM systems default to first-come, first-served scheduling, which can lead to head-of-line blocking and reduced system efficiency. Second, preemption introduces extra memory overhead to LLM systems as they must maintain intermediate states for unfinished (preempted) requests. In this paper, we propose TRAIL, a method to obtain output predictions from the target LLM itself. After generating each output token, we recycle the embedding of its internal structure as input for a lightweight classifier that predicts the remaining length for each running request. Using these predictions, we propose a prediction-based SRPT variant with limited preemption designed to account for memory overhead in LLM systems. This variant allows preemption early in request execution when memory consumption is low but restricts preemption as requests approach completion to optimize resource utilization. On the theoretical side, we derive a closed-form formula for this SRPT variant in an M/G/1 queue model, which demonstrates its potential value. In our system, we implement this preemption policy alongside our embedding-based prediction method.</description>

      <title>Spherical Analysis of Learning Nonlinear Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of functional neural networks. They have been proposed and studied with the aim of approximating continuous functionals defined on sets of functions on Euclidean domains. In this paper, we consider functionals defined on sets of functions on spheres. The approximation ability of deep ReLU neural networks is investigated by novel spherical analysis using an encoder-decoder framework. An encoder comes up first to accommodate the infinite-dimensional nature of the domain of functionals. It utilizes spherical harmonics to help us extract the latent finite-dimensional information of functions, which in turn facilitates in the next step of approximation analysis using fully connected neural networks. Moreover, real-world objects are frequently sampled discretely and are often corrupted by noise. Therefore, encoders with discrete input and those with discrete and random noise input are constructed, respectively. The approximation rates with different encoder structures are provided therein.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning complex dynamics driven by partial differential equations directly from data holds great promise for fast and accurate simulations of complex physical systems. In most cases, this problem can be formulated as an operator learning task, where one aims to learn the operator representing the physics of interest, which entails discretization of the continuous system. However, preserving key continuous properties at the discrete level, such as boundary conditions, and addressing physical systems with complex geometries is challenging for most existing approaches. We introduce a family of operator learning architectures, structure-preserving operator networks (SPONs), that allows to preserve key mathematical and physical properties of the continuous system by leveraging finite element (FE) discretizations of the input-output spaces. SPONs are encode-process-decode architectures that are end-to-end differentiable, where the encoder and decoder follows from the discretizations of the input-output spaces. SPONs can operate on complex geometries, enforce certain boundary conditions exactly, and offer theoretical guarantees. Our framework provides a flexible way of devising structure-preserving architectures tailored to specific applications, and offers an explicit trade-off between performance and efficiency, all thanks to the FE discretization of the input-output spaces. Additionally, we introduce a multigrid-inspired SPON architecture that yields improved performance at higher efficiency. Finally, we release a software to automate the design and training of SPON architectures.</description>

      <title>Convergent Privacy Loss of Noisy-SGD without Convexity and Smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Differential Privacy (DP) guarantee of hidden-state Noisy-SGD algorithms over a bounded domain. Standard privacy analysis for Noisy-SGD assumes all internal states are revealed, which leads to a divergent R'enyi DP bound with respect to the number of iterations. Ye &amp; Shokri (2022) and Altschuler &amp; Talwar (2022) proved convergent bounds for smooth (strongly) convex losses, and raise open questions about whether these assumptions can be relaxed. We provide positive answers by proving convergent R'enyi DP bound for non-convex non-smooth losses, where we show that requiring losses to have H\"older continuous gradient is sufficient. We also provide a strictly better privacy bound compared to state-of-the-art results for smooth strongly convex losses. Our analysis relies on the improvement of shifted divergence analysis in multiple aspects, including forward Wasserstein distance tracking, identifying the optimal shifts allocation, and the H"older reduction lemma. Our results further elucidate the benefit of hidden-state analysis for DP and its applicability.</description>

      <title>Inferring Kernel $\epsilon$-Machines: Discovering Structure in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, we showed that computational mechanic's causal states -- predictively-equivalent trajectory classes for a stochastic dynamical system -- can be cast into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The result is a widely-applicable method that infers causal structure directly from very different kinds of observations and systems. Here, we expand this method to explicitly introduce the causal diffusion components it produces. These encode the kernel causal-state estimates as a set of coordinates in a reduced dimension space. We show how each component extracts predictive features from data and demonstrate their application on four examples: first, a simple pendulum -- an exactly solvable system; second, a molecular-dynamic trajectory of $n$-butane -- a high-dimensional system with a well-studied energy landscape; third, the monthly sunspot sequence -- the longest-running available time series of direct observations; and fourth, multi-year observations of an active crop field -- a set of heterogeneous observations of the same ecosystem taken for over a decade. In this way, we demonstrate that the empirical kernel causal-states algorithm robustly discovers predictive structures for systems with widely varying dimensionality and stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Private Marginal Reconstruction with Local Non-Negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy is the dominant standard for formal and quantifiable privacy and has been used in major deployments that impact millions of people. Many differentially private algorithms for query release and synthetic data contain steps that reconstruct answers to queries from answers to other queries measured by the mechanism. Reconstruction is an important subproblem for such mechanisms to economize the privacy budget, minimize error on reconstructed answers, and allow for scalability to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we introduce a principled and efficient postprocessing method ReM (Residuals-to-Marginals) for reconstructing answers to marginal queries. Our method builds on recent work on efficient mechanisms for marginal query release, based on making measurements using a residual query basis that admits efficient pseudoinversion, which is an important primitive used in reconstruction. An extension GReM-LNN (Gaussian Residuals-to-Marginals with Local Non-negativity) reconstructs marginals under Gaussian noise satisfying consistency and non-negativity, which often reduces error on reconstructed answers. We demonstrate the utility of ReM and GReM-LNN by applying them to improve existing private query answering mechanisms: ResidualPlanner and MWEM.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structure in Offline Multi-Agent RL: The Benefits of Low Interaction Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an approximate equilibrium in the offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting. We introduce a structural assumption -- the interaction rank -- and establish that functions with low interaction rank are significantly more robust to distribution shift compared to general ones. Leveraging this observation, we demonstrate that utilizing function classes with low interaction rank, when combined with regularization and no-regret learning, admits decentralized, computationally and statistically efficient learning in offline MARL. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments that showcase the potential of critic architectures with low interaction rank in offline MARL, contrasting with commonly used single-agent value decomposition architectures.</description>

      <title>softmax is not enough (for sharp out-of-distribution)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key property of reasoning systems is the ability to make sharp decisions on their input data. For contemporary AI systems, a key carrier of sharp behaviour is the softmax function, with its capability to perform differentiable query-key lookups. It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks leveraging softmax arises from "circuits" which sharply perform certain kinds of computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these circuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid inputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding the maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items grows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the softmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive temperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at inference time.</description>

      <title>Embedding-based statistical inference on generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent cohort of publicly available generative models can produce human expert level content across a variety of topics and domains. Given a model in this cohort as a base model, methods such as parameter efficient fine-tuning, in-context learning, and constrained decoding have further increased generative capabilities and improved both computational and data efficiency. Entire collections of derivative models have emerged as a byproduct of these methods and each of these models has a set of associated covariates such as a score on a benchmark, an indicator for if the model has (or had) access to sensitive information, etc. that may or may not be available to the user. For some model-level covariates, it is possible to use "similar" models to predict an unknown covariate. In this paper we extend recent results related to embedding-based representations of generative models -- the data kernel perspective space -- to classical statistical inference settings. We demonstrate that using the perspective space as the basis of a notion of "similar" is effective for multiple model-level inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Almost Free: Self-concordance in Natural Exponential Families and an Application to Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that single-parameter natural exponential families with subexponential tails are self-concordant with polynomial-sized parameters. For subgaussian natural exponential families we establish an exact characterization of the growth rate of the self-concordance parameter. Applying these findings to bandits allows us to fill gaps in the literature: We show that optimistic algorithms for generalized linear bandits enjoy regret bounds that are both second-order (scale with the variance of the optimal arm's reward distribution) and free of an exponential dependence on the bound of the problem parameter in the leading term. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first regret bound for generalized linear bandits with subexponential tails, broadening the class of problems to include Poisson, exponential and gamma bandits.</description>

      <title>nGPT: Normalized Transformer with Representation Learning on the Hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, the normalized Transformer (nGPT) with representation learning on the hypersphere. In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many bias mitigation methods have been developed for addressing fairness issues in machine learning. We found that using linear mixup alone, a data augmentation technique, for bias mitigation, can still retain biases present in dataset labels. Research presented in this paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel pre-processing strategy in which both an existing mixup method and our new bias mitigation algorithm can be utilized to improve the generation of labels of augmented samples, which are proximity aware. Specifically, we proposed ProxiMix which keeps both pairwise and proximity relationships for fairer data augmentation. We conducted thorough experiments with three datasets, three ML models, and different hyperparameters settings. Our experimental results showed the effectiveness of ProxiMix from both fairness of predictions and fairness of recourse perspectives.</description>

      <title>Recovering Manifold Structure Using Ollivier-Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ORC-ManL, a new algorithm to prune spurious edges from nearest neighbor graphs using a criterion based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature and estimated metric distortion. Our motivation comes from manifold learning: we show that when the data generating the nearest-neighbor graph consists of noisy samples from a low-dimensional manifold, edges that shortcut through the ambient space have more negative Ollivier-Ricci curvature than edges that lie along the data manifold. We demonstrate that our method outperforms alternative pruning methods and that it significantly improves performance on many downstream geometric data analysis tasks that use nearest neighbor graphs as input. Specifically, we evaluate on manifold learning, persistent homology, dimension estimation, and others. We also show that ORC-ManL can be used to improve clustering and manifold learning of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Finally, we provide empirical convergence experiments that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Text2PDE: Latent Diffusion Models for Accessible Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have inspired numerous works on data-driven solutions to partial differential equation (PDE) problems. These neural PDE solvers can often be much faster than their numerical counterparts; however, each presents its unique limitations and generally balances training cost, numerical accuracy, and ease of applicability to different problem setups. To address these limitations, we introduce several methods to apply latent diffusion models to physics simulation. Firstly, we introduce a mesh autoencoder to compress arbitrarily discretized PDE data, allowing for efficient diffusion training across various physics. Furthermore, we investigate full spatio-temporal solution generation to mitigate autoregressive error accumulation. Lastly, we investigate conditioning on initial physical quantities, as well as conditioning solely on a text prompt to introduce text2PDE generation. We show that language can be a compact, interpretable, and accurate modality for generating physics simulations, paving the way for more usable and accessible PDE solvers. Through experiments on both uniform and structured grids, we show that the proposed approach is competitive with current neural PDE solvers in both accuracy and efficiency, with promising scaling behavior up to $\sim$3 billion parameters. By introducing a scalable, accurate, and usable physics simulator, we hope to bring neural PDE solvers closer to practical use.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Approach for Imbalanced Tabular Data in Advertiser Prospecting: A Case of Direct Mail Prospecting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring new customers is a vital process for growing businesses. Prospecting is the process of identifying and marketing to potential customers using methods ranging from online digital advertising, linear television, out of home, and direct mail. Despite the rapid growth in digital advertising (particularly social and search), research shows that direct mail remains one of the most effective ways to acquire new customers. However, there is a notable gap in the application of modern machine learning techniques within the direct mail space, which could significantly enhance targeting and personalization strategies. Methodologies deployed through direct mail are the focus of this paper.
  In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach for identifying new customers, i.e., prospecting, which comprises how we define labels for our data and rank potential customers. The casting of prospecting to a supervised learning problem leads to imbalanced tabular data. The current state-of-the-art approach for tabular data is an ensemble of tree-based methods like random forest and XGBoost. We propose a deep learning framework for tabular imbalanced data. This framework is designed to tackle large imbalanced datasets with vast number of numerical and categorical features. Our framework comprises two components: an autoencoder and a feed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a transparent real-world case study of prospecting in direct mail advertising. Our results show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state of the art tree-based random forest approach when applied in the real-world.</description>

      <title>Efficient PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Constant Malicious Noise Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding noise tolerance of learning algorithms under certain conditions is a central quest in learning theory. In this work, we study the problem of computationally efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in the presence of malicious noise, where an adversary can corrupt both instances and labels of training samples. The best-known noise tolerance either depends on a target error rate under distributional assumptions or on a margin parameter under large-margin conditions. In this work, we show that when both types of conditions are satisfied, it is possible to achieve {\em constant} noise tolerance by minimizing a reweighted hinge loss. Our key ingredients include: 1) an efficient algorithm that finds weights to control the gradient deterioration from corrupted samples, and 2) a new analysis on the robustness of the hinge loss equipped with such weights.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent with Adaptive Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a powerful optimization technique that is particularly useful in online learning scenarios. Its convergence analysis is relatively well understood under the assumption that the data samples are independent and identically distributed (iid). However, applying SGD to policy optimization problems in operations research involves a distinct challenge: the policy changes the environment and thereby affects the data used to update the policy. The adaptively generated data stream involves samples that are non-stationary, no longer independent from each other, and affected by previous decisions. The influence of previous decisions on the data generated introduces bias in the gradient estimate, which presents a potential source of instability for online learning not present in the iid case. In this paper, we introduce simple criteria for the adaptively generated data stream to guarantee the convergence of SGD. We show that the convergence speed of SGD with adaptive data is largely similar to the classical iid setting, as long as the mixing time of the policy-induced dynamics is factored in. Our Lyapunov-function analysis allows one to translate existing stability analysis of stochastic systems studied in operations research into convergence rates for SGD, and we demonstrate this for queueing and inventory management problems. We also showcase how our result can be applied to study the sample complexity of an actor-critic policy gradient algorithm.</description>

      <title>Were RNNs All We Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalability limitations of Transformers regarding sequence length have renewed interest in recurrent sequence models that are parallelizable during training. As a result, many novel recurrent architectures, such as S4, Mamba, and Aaren, have been proposed that achieve comparable performance. In this work, we revisit traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) from over a decade ago: LSTMs (1997) and GRUs (2014). While these models were slow due to requiring to backpropagate through time (BPTT), we show that by removing their hidden state dependencies from their input, forget, and update gates, LSTMs and GRUs no longer need to BPTT and can be efficiently trained in parallel. Building on this, we introduce minimal versions (minLSTMs and minGRUs) that (1) use significantly fewer parameters than their traditional counterparts and (2) are fully parallelizable during training (175x faster for a sequence of length 512). Lastly, we show that these stripped-down versions of decade-old RNNs match the empirical performance of recent sequence models.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Federated Learning with Correlated Client Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cross-device federated learning (FL) with millions of mobile clients, only a small subset of clients participate in training in every communication round, and Federated Averaging (FedAvg) is the most popular algorithm in practice. Existing analyses of FedAvg usually assume the participating clients are independently sampled in each round from a uniform distribution, which does not reflect real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that models client participation in FL as a Markov chain to study optimization convergence when clients have non-uniform and correlated participation across rounds. We apply this framework to analyze a more general and practical pattern: every client must wait a minimum number of $R$ rounds (minimum separation) before re-participating. We theoretically prove and empirically observe that increasing minimum separation reduces the bias induced by intrinsic non-uniformity of client availability in cross-device FL systems. Furthermore, we develop an effective debiasing algorithm for FedAvg that provably converges to the unbiased optimal solution under arbitrary minimum separation and unknown client availability distribution.</description>

      <title>Absolute State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization: High-Probability State-wise Constraints Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enforcing state-wise safety constraints is critical for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and robot manipulation. However, existing safe RL methods only enforce state-wise constraints in expectation or enforce hard state-wise constraints with strong assumptions. The former does not exclude the probability of safety violations, while the latter is impractical. Our insight is that although it is intractable to guarantee hard state-wise constraints in a model-free setting, we can enforce state-wise safety with high probability while excluding strong assumptions. To accomplish the goal, we propose Absolute State-wise Constrained Policy Optimization (ASCPO), a novel general-purpose policy search algorithm that guarantees high-probability state-wise constraint satisfaction for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training neural network policies for extensive robot locomotion tasks, where the agent must adhere to various state-wise safety constraints. Our results show that ASCPO significantly outperforms existing methods in handling state-wise constraints across challenging continuous control tasks, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Induced Covariance for Causal Discovery in Linear Sparse Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal models seek to unravel the cause-effect relationships among variables from observed data, as opposed to mere mappings among them, as traditional regression models do. This paper introduces a novel causal discovery algorithm designed for settings in which variables exhibit linearly sparse relationships. In such scenarios, the causal links represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be encapsulated in a structural matrix. The proposed approach leverages the structural matrix's ability to reconstruct data and the statistical properties it imposes on the data to identify the correct structural matrix. This method does not rely on independence tests or graph fitting procedures, making it suitable for scenarios with limited training data. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the well-known PC, GES, BIC exact search, and LINGAM-based methods in recovering linearly sparse causal structures.</description>

      <title>See Me and Believe Me: Causality and Intersectionality in Testimonial Injustice in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In medical settings, it is critical that all who are in need of care are correctly heard and understood. When this is not the case due to prejudices a listener has, the speaker is experiencing \emph{testimonial injustice}, which, building upon recent work, we quantify by the presence of several categories of unjust vocabulary in medical notes. In this paper, we use FCI, a causal discovery method, to study the degree to which certain demographic features could lead to marginalization (e.g., age, gender, and race) by way of contributing to testimonial injustice. To achieve this, we review physicians' notes for each patient, where we identify occurrences of unjust vocabulary, along with the demographic features present, and use causal discovery to build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) relating those demographic features to testimonial injustice. We analyze and discuss the resulting SCMs to show the interaction of these factors and how they influence the experience of injustice. Despite the potential presence of some confounding variables, we observe how one contributing feature can make a person more prone to experiencing another contributor of testimonial injustice. There is no single root of injustice and thus intersectionality cannot be ignored. These results call for considering more than singular or equalized attributes of who a person is when analyzing and improving their experiences of bias and injustice. This work is thus a first foray at using causal discovery to understand the nuanced experiences of patients in medical settings, and its insights could be used to guide design principles throughout healthcare, to build trust and promote better patient care.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Dual Approximation Policy Optimization (DAPO), a framework that incorporates general function approximation into policy mirror descent methods. In contrast to the popular approach of using the $L_2$-norm to measure function approximation errors, DAPO uses the dual Bregman divergence induced by the mirror map for policy projection. This duality framework has both theoretical and practical implications: not only does it achieve fast linear convergence with general function approximation, but it also includes several well-known practical methods as special cases, immediately providing strong convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>HelpSteer2-Preference: Complementing Ratings with Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this reward model at aligning models to follow instructions in RLHF. We open-source this dataset (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 and openly release the trained Reward Model at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward</description>

      <title>Deep Unlearn: Benchmarking Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of particular data points from the learnable parameters of a trained machine learning model. This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Temporal Difference Learning in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning, the ability to adapt based on a few examples in the input prompt, is a ubiquitous feature of large language models (LLMs). However, as LLMs' in-context learning abilities continue to improve, understanding this phenomenon mechanistically becomes increasingly important. In particular, it is not well-understood how LLMs learn to solve specific classes of problems, such as reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in-context. Through three different tasks, we first show that Llama $3$ $70$B can solve simple RL problems in-context. We then analyze the residual stream of Llama using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and find representations that closely match temporal difference (TD) errors. Notably, these representations emerge despite the model only being trained to predict the next token. We verify that these representations are indeed causally involved in the computation of TD errors and $Q$-values by performing carefully designed interventions on them. Taken together, our work establishes a methodology for studying and manipulating in-context learning with SAEs, paving the way for a more mechanistic understanding.</description>

      <title>Speculative Coreset Selection for Task-Specific Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-specific fine-tuning is essential for the deployment of large language models (LLMs), but it requires significant computational resources and time. Existing solutions have proposed coreset selection methods to improve data efficiency and reduce model training overhead, but they still have limitations: 1) Overlooking valuable samples at high pruning rates, which degrades the coreset's performance. 2) Requiring high time overhead during coreset selection to fine-tune and evaluate the target LLM. In this paper, we introduce STAFF, a speculative coreset selection method. STAFF leverages a small model from the same family as the target LLM to efficiently estimate data scores and then verifies the scores on the target LLM to accurately identify and allocate more selection budget to important regions while maintaining coverage of easy regions. We evaluate STAFF on three LLMs and three downstream tasks and show that STAFF improves the performance of SOTA methods by up to 54.3% and reduces selection overhead by up to 70.5% at different pruning rates. Furthermore, we observe that the coreset selected by STAFF at low pruning rates (i.e., 20%) can even obtain better fine-tuning performance than the full dataset.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Expressiveness of GNNs: A Computational Model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are extensively employed in graph machine learning, with considerable research focusing on their expressiveness. Current studies often assess GNN expressiveness by comparing them to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) tests or classical graph algorithms. However, we identify three key issues in existing analyses: (1) some studies use preprocessing to enhance expressiveness but overlook its computational costs; (2) some claim the anonymous WL test's limited power while enhancing expressiveness using non-anonymous features, creating a mismatch; and (3) some characterize message-passing GNNs (MPGNNs) with the CONGEST model but make unrealistic assumptions about computational resources, allowing $\textsf{NP-Complete}$ problems to be solved in $O(m)$ depth. We contend that a well-defined computational model is urgently needed to serve as the foundation for discussions on GNN expressiveness. To address these issues, we introduce the Resource-Limited CONGEST (RL-CONGEST) model, incorporating optional preprocessing and postprocessing to form a framework for analyzing GNN expressiveness. Our framework sheds light on computational aspects, including the computational hardness of hash functions in the WL test and the role of virtual nodes in reducing network capacity. Additionally, we suggest that high-order GNNs correspond to first-order model-checking problems, offering new insights into their expressiveness.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Energy-based Policies using Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based policies offer a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL). In maximum entropy RL, the optimal policy is a Boltzmann distribution derived from the soft Q-function, but direct sampling from this distribution in continuous action spaces is computationally intractable. As a result, existing methods typically use simpler parametric distributions, like Gaussians, for policy representation - limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of multimodal action distributions. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based approach for sampling from energy-based policies, where the negative Q-function defines the energy function. Based on this approach, we propose an actor-critic method called Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS) that enables more expressive policy representations, allowing stable learning in diverse environments. We show that our approach enhances exploration and captures multimodal behavior in continuous control tasks, addressing key limitations of existing methods.</description>

      <title>Forte : Finding Outliers with Representation Typicality Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models can now produce photorealistic synthetic data which is virtually indistinguishable from the real data used to train it. This is a significant evolution over previous models which could produce reasonable facsimiles of the training data, but ones which could be visually distinguished from the training data by human evaluation. Recent work on OOD detection has raised doubts that generative model likelihoods are optimal OOD detectors due to issues involving likelihood misestimation, entropy in the generative process, and typicality. We speculate that generative OOD detectors also failed because their models focused on the pixels rather than the semantic content of the data, leading to failures in near-OOD cases where the pixels may be similar but the information content is significantly different. We hypothesize that estimating typical sets using self-supervised learners leads to better OOD detectors. We introduce a novel approach that leverages representation learning, and informative summary statistics based on manifold estimation, to address all of the aforementioned issues. Our method outperforms other unsupervised approaches and achieves state-of-the art performance on well-established challenging benchmarks, and new synthetic data detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Fair Class-Incremental Learning using Sample Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model fairness is becoming important in class-incremental learning for Trustworthy AI. While accuracy has been a central focus in class-incremental learning, fairness has been relatively understudied. However, naively using all the samples of the current task for training results in unfair catastrophic forgetting for certain sensitive groups including classes. We theoretically analyze that forgetting occurs if the average gradient vector of the current task data is in an "opposite direction" compared to the average gradient vector of a sensitive group, which means their inner products are negative. We then propose a fair class-incremental learning framework that adjusts the training weights of current task samples to change the direction of the average gradient vector and thus reduce the forgetting of underperforming groups and achieve fairness. For various group fairness measures, we formulate optimization problems to minimize the overall losses of sensitive groups while minimizing the disparities among them. We also show the problems can be solved with linear programming and propose an efficient Fairness-aware Sample Weighting (FSW) algorithm. Experiments show that FSW achieves better accuracy-fairness tradeoff results than state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of POMDPs with Known Observation Model in Average-Reward Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dealing with Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes is notably a challenging task. We face an average-reward infinite-horizon POMDP setting with an unknown transition model, where we assume the knowledge of the observation model. Under this assumption, we propose the Observation-Aware Spectral (OAS) estimation technique, which enables the POMDP parameters to be learned from samples collected using a belief-based policy. Then, we propose the OAS-UCRL algorithm that implicitly balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off following the $\textit{optimism in the face of uncertainty}$ principle. The algorithm runs through episodes of increasing length. For each episode, the optimal belief-based policy of the estimated POMDP interacts with the environment and collects samples that will be used in the next episode by the OAS estimation procedure to compute a new estimate of the POMDP parameters. Given the estimated model, an optimization oracle computes the new optimal policy. We show the consistency of the OAS procedure, and we prove a regret guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log(T)})$ for the proposed OAS-UCRL algorithm. We compare against the oracle playing the optimal stochastic belief-based policy and show the efficient scaling of our approach with respect to the dimensionality of the state, action, and observation space. We finally conduct numerical simulations to validate and compare the proposed technique with other baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>PhyMPGN: Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network for spatiotemporal PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains.</description>

      <title>FlashMask: Efficient and Rich Mask Extension of FlashAttention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational and memory demands of vanilla attention scale quadratically with the sequence length $N$, posing significant challenges for processing long sequences in Transformer models. FlashAttention alleviates these challenges by eliminating the $O(N^2)$ memory dependency and reducing attention latency through IO-aware memory optimizations. However, its native support for certain attention mask types is limited, and it does not inherently accommodate more complex masking requirements. Previous approaches resort to using dense masks with $O(N^2)$ memory complexity, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose FlashMask, an extension of FlashAttention that introduces a column-wise sparse representation of attention masks. This approach efficiently represents a wide range of mask types and facilitates the development of optimized kernel implementations. By adopting this novel representation, FlashMask achieves linear memory complexity $O(N)$, suitable for modeling long-context sequences. Moreover, this representation enables kernel optimizations that eliminate unnecessary computations by leveraging sparsity in the attention mask, without sacrificing computational accuracy, resulting in higher computational efficiency. We evaluate FlashMask's performance in fine-tuning and alignment training of LLMs such as SFT, LoRA, DPO, and RM. FlashMask achieves significant throughput improvements, with end-to-end speedups ranging from 1.65x to 3.22x compared to existing FlashAttention dense method. Additionally, our kernel-level comparisons demonstrate that FlashMask surpasses the latest counterpart, FlexAttention, by 12.1% to 60.7% in terms of kernel TFLOPs/s, achieving 37.8% to 62.3% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on the A100 GPU. The code is open-sourced on PaddlePaddle and integrated into PaddleNLP, supporting models with over 100 billion parameters for contexts up to 128K tokens.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Graph Neural Networks with Provably High-Order Expressive Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DyGNNs) have garnered increasing research attention for learning representations on evolving graphs. Despite their effectiveness, the limited expressive power of existing DyGNNs hinders them from capturing important evolving patterns of dynamic graphs. Although some works attempt to enhance expressive capability with heuristic features, there remains a lack of DyGNN frameworks with provable and quantifiable high-order expressive power. To address this research gap, we firstly propose the k-dimensional Dynamic WL tests (k-DWL) as the referencing algorithms to quantify the expressive power of DyGNNs. We demonstrate that the expressive power of existing DyGNNs is upper bounded by the 1-DWL test. To enhance the expressive power, we propose Dynamic Graph Neural Network with High-order expressive power (HopeDGN), which updates the representation of central node pair by aggregating the interaction history with neighboring node pairs. Our theoretical results demonstrate that HopeDGN can achieve expressive power equivalent to the 2-DWL test. We then present a Transformer-based implementation for the local variant of HopeDGN. Experimental results show that HopeDGN achieved performance improvements of up to 3.12%, demonstrating the effectiveness of HopeDGN.</description>

      <title>FLAME: Adaptive and Reactive Concept Drift Mitigation for Federated Learning Deployments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Federated Learning with Adaptive Monitoring and Elimination (FLAME), a novel solution capable of detecting and mitigating concept drift in Federated Learning (FL) Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Concept drift poses significant challenges for FL models deployed in dynamic and real-world settings. FLAME leverages an FL architecture, considers a real-world FL pipeline, and proves capable of maintaining model performance and accuracy while addressing bandwidth and privacy constraints. Introducing various features and extensions on previous works, FLAME offers a robust solution to concept drift, significantly reducing computational load and communication overhead. Compared to well-known lightweight mitigation methods, FLAME demonstrates superior performance in maintaining high F1 scores and reducing resource utilisation in large-scale IoT deployments, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference Tools for a Better Evaluation of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for applying rigorous statistical techniques from econometrics to analyze and improve machine learning systems. We introduce key statistical methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression, explaining their theoretical foundations and practical applications in machine learning evaluation. The document serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners, detailing how these techniques can provide deeper insights into model behavior, performance, and fairness. We cover the mathematical principles behind each method, discuss their assumptions and limitations, and provide step-by-step instructions for their implementation. The paper also addresses how to interpret results, emphasizing the importance of statistical significance and effect size. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how these tools can reveal subtle patterns and interactions in machine learning models that are not apparent from traditional evaluation metrics. By connecting the fields of econometrics and machine learning, this work aims to equip readers with powerful analytical tools for more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of AI systems. The framework presented here contributes to developing more robust, interpretable, and fair machine learning technologies.</description>

      <title>Gaussian kernel expansion with basis functions uniformly bounded in $\mathcal{L}_{\infty}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel expansions are a topic of considerable interest in machine learning, also because of their relation to the so-called feature maps introduced in machine learning. Properties of the associated basis functions and weights (corresponding to eigenfunctions and eigenvalues in the Mercer setting) give insight into for example the structure of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space, the goodness of approximation schemes, the convergence rates and generalization properties of kernel machines. Recent work in the literature has derived some of these results by assuming uniformly bounded basis functions in $\mathcal{L}_\infty$. Motivated by this line of research, we investigate under this constraint all possible kernel expansions of the Gaussian kernel, one of the most widely used models in machine learning. Our main result is the construction on $\mathbb{R}^2$ of a Gaussian kernel expansion with weights in $\ell_p$ for any $p&gt;1$. This result is optimal since we also prove that $p=1$ cannot be reached by the Gaussian kernel, nor by any of the other radial basis function kernels commonly used in the literature. A consequence for this kind of kernels is also the non-existence of Mercer expansions on $\mathbb{R}^2$, with respect to any finite measure, whose eigenfunctions all belong to a closed ball of $\mathcal{L}_\infty$.</description>

      <title>On Expressive Power of Looped Transformers: Theoretical Analysis and Enhancement via Timestep Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looped Transformers offer advantages in parameter efficiency and Turing completeness. However, their expressive power for function approximation and approximation rate remains underexplored. In this paper, we establish approximation rates of Looped Transformers by defining the concept of the modulus of continuity for sequence-to-sequence functions. This reveals a limitation specific to the looped architecture. That is, the analysis prompts us to incorporate scaling parameters for each loop, conditioned on timestep encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of loops enhances performance, with further gains achieved through the timestep encoding architecture.</description>

      <title>Fair4Free: Generating High-fidelity Fair Synthetic Samples using Data Free Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Fair4Free, a novel generative model to generate synthetic fair data using data-free distillation in the latent space. Fair4Free can work on the situation when the data is private or inaccessible. In our approach, we first train a teacher model to create fair representation and then distil the knowledge to a student model (using a smaller architecture). The process of distilling the student model is data-free, i.e. the student model does not have access to the training dataset while distilling. After the distillation, we use the distilled model to generate fair synthetic samples. Our extensive experiments show that our synthetic samples outperform state-of-the-art models in all three criteria (fairness, utility and synthetic quality) with a performance increase of 5% for fairness, 8% for utility and 12% in synthetic quality for both tabular and image datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this publication, we assess the ability of a novel Reinforcement Learning-based solution to the problem of Neural Architecture Search, where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to search for good architectures, rather than to return a single optimal architecture. We consider both the NAS-Bench-101 and NAS- Bench-301 settings, and compare against various known strong baselines, such as local search and random search. We conclude that our Reinforcement Learning agent displays strong scalability with regards to the size of the search space, but limited robustness to hyperparameter changes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive teachers for amortized samplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amortized inference is the task of training a parametric model, such as a neural network, to approximate a distribution with a given unnormalized density where exact sampling is intractable. When sampling is implemented as a sequential decision-making process, reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as generative flow networks, can be used to train the sampling policy. Off-policy RL training facilitates the discovery of diverse, high-reward candidates, but existing methods still face challenges in efficient exploration. We propose to use an adaptive training distribution (the Teacher) to guide the training of the primary amortized sampler (the Student) by prioritizing high-loss regions. The Teacher, an auxiliary behavior model, is trained to sample high-error regions of the Student and can generalize across unexplored modes, thereby enhancing mode coverage by providing an efficient training curriculum. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in a synthetic environment designed to present an exploration challenge, two diffusion-based sampling tasks, and four biochemical discovery tasks demonstrating its ability to improve sample efficiency and mode coverage.</description>

      <title>Circuit Compositions: Exploring Modular Structures in Transformer-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental question in interpretability research is to what extent neural networks, particularly language models, implement reusable functions via subnetworks that can be composed to perform more complex tasks. Recent developments in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying subnetworks, often referred to as circuits, which represent the minimal computational subgraph responsible for a model's behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits relate to each other. To address this gap, we examine the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circuits identified can be reused and combined through subnetwork set operations to represent more complex functional capabilities of the model.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretical Principled Trade-off between Jailbreakability and Stealthiness on Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in artificial intelligence, transforming tasks across various domains. Despite their capabilities, these models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety and reliability. This paper explores the trade-off between jailbreakability and stealthiness in VLMs, presenting a novel algorithm to detect non-stealthy jailbreak attacks and enhance model robustness. We introduce a stealthiness-aware jailbreak attack using diffusion models, highlighting the challenge of detecting AI-generated content. Our approach leverages Fano's inequality to elucidate the relationship between attack success rates and stealthiness scores, providing an explainable framework for evaluating these threats. Our contributions aim to fortify AI systems against sophisticated attacks, ensuring their outputs remain aligned with ethical standards and user expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was proved that group equivariance emerges in ensembles of neural networks as the result of full augmentation in the limit of infinitely wide neural networks (neural tangent kernel limit). In this paper, we extend this result significantly. We provide a proof that this emergence does not depend on the neural tangent kernel limit at all. We also consider stochastic settings, and furthermore general architectures. For the latter, we provide a simple sufficient condition on the relation between the architecture and the action of the group for our results to hold. We validate our findings through simple numeric experiments.</description>

      <title>Verbalized Graph Representation Learning: A Fully Interpretable Graph Model Based on Large Language Models Throughout the Entire Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant interest due to its wide-ranging real-world applications, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Traditional GNN methods focus on encoding the structural information of graphs, often using shallow text embeddings for node or edge attributes. This limits the model to understand the rich semantic information in the data and its reasoning ability for complex downstream tasks, while also lacking interpretability. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies are combining them with GNNs for graph representation learning and downstream tasks. While these approaches effectively leverage the rich semantic information in TAGs datasets, their main drawback is that they are only partially interpretable, which limits their application in critical fields. In this paper, we propose a verbalized graph representation learning (VGRL) method which is fully interpretable. In contrast to traditional graph machine learning models, which are usually optimized within a continuous parameter space, VGRL constrains this parameter space to be text description which ensures complete interpretability throughout the entire process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the decisions of the model. We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VGRL and we believe these method can serve as a stepping stone in graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Selective Aggregation for Low-Rank Adaptation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate LoRA in federated learning through the lens of the asymmetry analysis of the learned $A$ and $B$ matrices. In doing so, we uncover that $A$ matrices are responsible for learning general knowledge, while $B$ matrices focus on capturing client-specific knowledge. Based on this finding, we introduce Federated Share-A Low-Rank Adaptation (FedSA-LoRA), which employs two low-rank trainable matrices $A$ and $B$ to model the weight update, but only $A$ matrices are shared with the server for aggregation. Moreover, we delve into the relationship between the learned $A$ and $B$ matrices in other LoRA variants, such as rsLoRA and VeRA, revealing a consistent pattern. Consequently, we extend our FedSA-LoRA method to these LoRA variants, resulting in FedSA-rsLoRA and FedSA-VeRA. In this way, we establish a general paradigm for integrating LoRA with FL, offering guidance for future work on subsequent LoRA variants combined with FL. Extensive experimental results on natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reducing Variance in Meta-Learning via Laplace Approximation for Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set of sample points, meta-learning algorithms aim to learn an optimal adaptation strategy for new, unseen tasks. Often, this data can be ambiguous as it might belong to different tasks concurrently. This is particularly the case in meta-regression tasks. In such cases, the estimated adaptation strategy is subject to high variance due to the limited amount of support data for each task, which often leads to sub-optimal generalization performance. In this work, we address the problem of variance reduction in gradient-based meta-learning and formalize the class of problems prone to this, a condition we refer to as \emph{task overlap}. Specifically, we propose a novel approach that reduces the variance of the gradient estimate by weighing each support point individually by the variance of its posterior over the parameters. To estimate the posterior, we utilize the Laplace approximation, which allows us to express the variance in terms of the curvature of the loss landscape of our meta-learner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and highlight the importance of variance reduction in meta-learning.</description>

      <title>Foldable SuperNets: Scalable Merging of Transformers with Different Initializations and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recent methods aim to merge neural networks (NNs) with identical architectures trained on different tasks to obtain a single multi-task model. Most existing works tackle the simpler setup of merging NNs initialized from a common pre-trained network, where simple heuristics like weight averaging work well. This work targets a more challenging goal: merging large transformers trained on different tasks from distinct initializations. First, we demonstrate that traditional merging methods fail catastrophically in this setup. To overcome this challenge, we propose Foldable SuperNet Merge (FS-Merge), a method that optimizes a SuperNet to fuse the original models using a feature reconstruction loss. FS-Merge is simple, data-efficient, and capable of merging models of varying widths. We test FS-Merge against existing methods, including knowledge distillation, on MLPs and transformers across various settings, sizes, tasks, and modalities. FS-Merge consistently outperforms them, achieving SOTA results, particularly in limited data scenarios.</description>

      <title>Discrete Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching for Graph Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transporting between arbitrary distributions is a fundamental goal in generative modeling. Recently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to obtain in practice. Furthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space. Our approach extends Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its convergence to the SB. Furthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph transformation and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost function described by the graph edit distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field of chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes molecules' property-of-interest with minimal graph transformation, successfully retaining other features.</description>

      <title>Bounds on $L_p$ Errors in Density Ratio Estimation via $f$-Divergence Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique for identifying relationships between two probability distributions. $f$-divergence loss functions, derived from variational representations of $f$-divergence, are commonly employed in DRE to achieve state-of-the-art results. This study presents a novel perspective on DRE using $f$-divergence loss functions by deriving the upper and lower bounds on $L_p$ errors. These bounds apply to any estimator within a class of Lipschitz continuous estimators, irrespective of the specific $f$-divergence loss functions utilized. The bounds are formulated as a product of terms that include the data dimension and the expected value of the density ratio raised to the power of $p$. Notably, the lower bound incorporates an exponential term dependent on the Kullback--Leibler divergence, indicating that the $L_p$ error significantly increases with the Kullback--Leibler divergence for $p &gt; 1$, and this increase becomes more pronounced as $p$ increases. Furthermore, these theoretical findings are substantiated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>TiVaT: Joint-Axis Attention for Time Series Forecasting with Lead-Lag Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, yet simultaneously capturing both temporal and inter-variable dependencies remains a challenge. Conventional Channel-Dependent (CD) models handle these dependencies separately, limiting their ability to model complex interactions such as lead-lag dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose TiVaT (Time-Variable Transformer), a novel architecture that integrates temporal and variate dependencies through its Joint-Axis (JA) attention mechanism. TiVaT's ability to capture intricate variate-temporal dependencies, including asynchronous interactions, is further enhanced by the incorporation of Distance-aware Time-Variable (DTV) Sampling, which reduces noise and improves accuracy through a learned 2D map that focuses on key interactions. TiVaT effectively models both temporal and variate dependencies, consistently delivering strong performance across diverse datasets. Notably, it excels in capturing complex patterns within multivariate time series, enabling it to surpass or remain competitive with state-of-the-art methods. This positions TiVaT as a new benchmark in MTS forecasting, particularly in handling datasets characterized by intricate and challenging dependencies.</description>

      <title>Lines of Thought in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models achieve next-token prediction by transporting a vectorized piece of text (prompt) across an accompanying embedding space under the action of successive transformer layers. The resulting high-dimensional trajectories realize different contextualization, or 'thinking', steps, and fully determine the output probability distribution. We aim to characterize the statistical properties of ensembles of these 'lines of thought.' We observe that independent trajectories cluster along a low-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifold, and that their path can be well approximated by a stochastic equation with few parameters extracted from data. We find it remarkable that the vast complexity of such large models can be reduced to a much simpler form, and we reflect on implications.</description>

      <title>Bayes' Power for Explaining In-Context Learning Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, neural network training has been primarily viewed as an approximation of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This interpretation originated in a time when training for multiple epochs on small datasets was common and performance was data bound; but it falls short in the era of large-scale single-epoch trainings ushered in by large self-supervised setups, like language models. In this new setup, performance is compute-bound, but data is readily available. As models became more powerful, in-context learning (ICL), i.e., learning in a single forward-pass based on the context, emerged as one of the dominant paradigms. In this paper, we argue that a more useful interpretation of neural network behavior in this era is as an approximation of the true posterior, as defined by the data-generating process. We demonstrate this interpretations' power for ICL and its usefulness to predict generalizations to previously unseen tasks. We show how models become robust in-context learners by effectively composing knowledge from their training data. We illustrate this with experiments that reveal surprising generalizations, all explicable through the exact posterior. Finally, we show the inherent constraints of the generalization capabilities of posteriors and the limitations of neural networks in approximating these posteriors.</description>

      <title>Truncated Kernel Stochastic Gradient Descent on Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the structure of spherical harmonics, we propose the truncated kernel stochastic gradient descent (T-kernel SGD) algorithm with a least-square loss function for spherical data fitting. T-kernel SGD employs a "truncation" operation, enabling the application of a series-based kernel function in stochastic gradient descent, thereby avoiding the difficulties of finding suitable closed-form kernel functions in high-dimensional spaces. In contrast to traditional kernel SGD, T-kernel SGD is more effective in balancing bias and variance by dynamically adjusting the hypothesis space during iterations. The most significant advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can achieve theoretically optimal convergence rates using a constant step size (independent of the sample size) while overcoming the inherent saturation problem of kernel SGD. Additionally, we leverage the structure of spherical polynomials to derive an equivalent T-kernel SGD, significantly reducing storage and computational costs compared to kernel SGD. Typically, T-kernel SGD requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\frac{d}{d-1}\epsilon})$ computational complexity and $\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{d}{d-1}\epsilon})$ storage to achieve optimal rates for the d-dimensional sphere, where $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;\frac{1}{2}$ can be arbitrarily small if the optimal fitting or the underlying space possesses sufficient regularity. This regularity is determined by the smoothness parameter of the objective function and the decaying rate of the eigenvalues of the integral operator associated with the kernel function, both of which reflect the difficulty of the estimation problem. Our main results quantitatively characterize how this prior information influences the convergence of T-kernel SGD. The numerical experiments further validate the theoretical findings presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Robust Algorithmic Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of machine learning models in high-stakes domains can have a major negative impact, especially on individuals who receive undesirable outcomes. Algorithmic recourse provides such individuals with suggestions of minimum-cost improvements they can make to achieve a desirable outcome in the future. However, machine learning models often get updated over time and this can cause a recourse to become invalid (i.e., not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature aims to choose recourses that are less sensitive, even against adversarial model changes, but this comes at a higher cost. To overcome this obstacle, we initiate the study of algorithmic recourse through the learning-augmented framework and evaluate the extent to which a designer equipped with a prediction regarding future model changes can reduce the cost of recourse when the prediction is accurate (consistency) while also limiting the cost even when the prediction is inaccurate (robustness). We propose a novel algorithm for this problem, study the robustness-consistency trade-off, and analyze how prediction accuracy affects performance.</description>

      <title>DynFrs: An Efficient Framework for Machine Unlearning in Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Forests are widely recognized for establishing efficacy in classification and regression tasks, standing out in various domains such as medical diagnosis, finance, and personalized recommendations. These domains, however, are inherently sensitive to privacy concerns, as personal and confidential data are involved. With increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, particularly under regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, the ability to perform machine unlearning has become crucial for Random Forests. However, insufficient attention was paid to this topic, and existing approaches face difficulties in being applied to real-world scenarios. Addressing this gap, we propose the DynFrs framework designed to enable efficient machine unlearning in Random Forests while preserving predictive accuracy. Dynfrs leverages subsampling method Occ(q) and a lazy tag strategy Lzy, and is still adaptable to any Random Forest variant. In essence, Occ(q) ensures that each sample in the training set occurs only in a proportion of trees so that the impact of deleting samples is limited, and Lzy delays the reconstruction of a tree node until necessary, thereby avoiding unnecessary modifications on tree structures. In experiments, applying Dynfrs on Extremely Randomized Trees yields substantial improvements, achieving orders of magnitude faster unlearning performance and better predictive accuracy than existing machine unlearning methods for Random Forests.</description>

      <title>ENTP: Encoder-only Next Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-token prediction models have predominantly relied on decoder-only Transformers with causal attention, driven by the common belief that causal attention is essential to prevent "cheating" by masking future tokens. We challenge this widely accepted notion and argue that this design choice is about efficiency rather than necessity. While decoder-only Transformers are still a good choice for practical reasons, they are not the only viable option. In this work, we introduce Encoder-only Next Token Prediction (ENTP). We explore the differences between ENTP and decoder-only Transformers in expressive power and complexity, highlighting potential advantages of ENTP. We introduce the Triplet-Counting task and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that while ENTP can perform this task easily, a decoder-only Transformer cannot. Finally, we empirically demonstrate ENTP's superior performance across various realistic tasks, such as length generalization and in-context learning.</description>

      <title>Automated Red Teaming with GOAT: the Generative Offensive Agent Tester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red teaming assesses how large language models (LLMs) can produce content that violates norms, policies, and rules set during their safety training. However, most existing automated methods in the literature are not representative of the way humans tend to interact with AI models. Common users of AI models may not have advanced knowledge of adversarial machine learning methods or access to model internals, and they do not spend a lot of time crafting a single highly effective adversarial prompt. Instead, they are likely to make use of techniques commonly shared online and exploit the multiturn conversational nature of LLMs. While manual testing addresses this gap, it is an inefficient and often expensive process. To address these limitations, we introduce the Generative Offensive Agent Tester (GOAT), an automated agentic red teaming system that simulates plain language adversarial conversations while leveraging multiple adversarial prompting techniques to identify vulnerabilities in LLMs. We instantiate GOAT with 7 red teaming attacks by prompting a general-purpose model in a way that encourages reasoning through the choices of methods available, the current target model's response, and the next steps. Our approach is designed to be extensible and efficient, allowing human testers to focus on exploring new areas of risk while automation covers the scaled adversarial stress-testing of known risk territory. We present the design and evaluation of GOAT, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with an ASR@10 of 97% against Llama 3.1 and 88% against GPT-4 on the JailbreakBench dataset.</description>

      <title>On Using Certified Training towards Empirical Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is arguably the most popular way to provide empirical robustness against specific adversarial examples. While variants based on multi-step attacks incur significant computational overhead, single-step variants are vulnerable to a failure mode known as catastrophic overfitting, which hinders their practical utility for large perturbations. A parallel line of work, certified training, has focused on producing networks amenable to formal guarantees of robustness against any possible attack. However, the wide gap between the best-performing empirical and certified defenses has severely limited the applicability of the latter. Inspired by recent developments in certified training, which rely on a combination of adversarial attacks with network over-approximations, and by the connections between local linearity and catastrophic overfitting, we present experimental evidence on the practical utility and limitations of using certified training towards empirical robustness. We show that, when tuned for the purpose, a recent certified training algorithm can prevent catastrophic overfitting on single-step attacks, and that it can bridge the gap to multi-step baselines under appropriate experimental settings. Finally, we present a novel regularizer for network over-approximations that can achieve similar effects while markedly reducing runtime.</description>

      <title>Fira: Can We Achieve Full-rank Training of LLMs Under Low-rank Constraint?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank training has emerged as a promising approach for reducing memory usage in training Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous methods either rely on decomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient matrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of them constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to sub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to consistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while achieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of full-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to achieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM training: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the gradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on this observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the scaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original full-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve the low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for better performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises during the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address this, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via regulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on the pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA and GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than full-rank training.</description>

      <title>Does Graph Prompt Work? A Data Operation Perspective with Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, graph prompting has emerged as a promising research direction, enabling the learning of additional tokens or subgraphs appended to the original graphs without requiring retraining of pre-trained graph models across various applications. This novel paradigm, shifting from the traditional pretraining and finetuning to pretraining and prompting has shown significant empirical success in simulating graph data operations, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to biological networks and graph transferring. However, despite its potential, the theoretical underpinnings of graph prompting remain underexplored, raising critical questions about its fundamental effectiveness. The lack of rigorous theoretical proof of why and how much it works is more like a dark cloud over the graph prompt area to go further. To fill this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework that rigorously analyzes graph prompting from a data operation perspective. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a formal guarantee theorem, demonstrating graph prompts capacity to approximate graph transformation operators, effectively linking upstream and downstream tasks. Second, we derive upper bounds on the error of these data operations by graph prompts for a single graph and extend this discussion to batches of graphs, which are common in graph model training. Third, we analyze the distribution of data operation errors, extending our theoretical findings from linear graph models (e.g., GCN) to non-linear graph models (e.g., GAT). Extensive experiments support our theoretical results and confirm the practical implications of these guarantees.</description>

      <title>Moral Alignment for LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are under way to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and the transparency of this will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital.
  The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents.
  We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques.</description>

      <title>Stable Offline Value Function Learning with Bisimulation-based Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, offline value function learning is the procedure of using an offline dataset to estimate the expected discounted return from each state when taking actions according to a fixed target policy. The stability of this procedure, i.e., whether it converges to its fixed-point, critically depends on the representations of the state-action pairs. Poorly learned representations can make value function learning unstable, or even divergent. Therefore, it is critical to stabilize value function learning by explicitly shaping the state-action representations. Recently, the class of bisimulation-based algorithms have shown promise in shaping representations for control. However, it is still unclear if this class of methods can stabilize value function learning. In this work, we investigate this question and answer it affirmatively. We introduce a bisimulation-based algorithm called kernel representations for offline policy evaluation (KROPE). KROPE uses a kernel to shape state-action representations such that state-action pairs that have similar immediate rewards and lead to similar next state-action pairs under the target policy also have similar representations. We show that KROPE: 1) learns stable representations and 2) leads to lower value error than baselines. Our analysis provides new theoretical insight into the stability properties of bisimulation-based methods and suggests that practitioners can use these methods for stable and accurate evaluation of offline reinforcement learning agents.</description>

      <title>shapiq: Shapley Interactions for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally rooted in game theory, the Shapley Value (SV) has recently become an important tool in machine learning research. Perhaps most notably, it is used for feature attribution and data valuation in explainable artificial intelligence. Shapley Interactions (SIs) naturally extend the SV and address its limitations by assigning joint contributions to groups of entities, which enhance understanding of black box machine learning models. Due to the exponential complexity of computing SVs and SIs, various methods have been proposed that exploit structural assumptions or yield probabilistic estimates given limited resources. In this work, we introduce shapiq, an open-source Python package that unifies state-of-the-art algorithms to efficiently compute SVs and any-order SIs in an application-agnostic framework. Moreover, it includes a benchmarking suite containing 11 machine learning applications of SIs with pre-computed games and ground-truth values to systematically assess computational performance across domains. For practitioners, shapiq is able to explain and visualize any-order feature interactions in predictions of models, including vision transformers, language models, as well as XGBoost and LightGBM with TreeSHAP-IQ. With shapiq, we extend shap beyond feature attributions and consolidate the application of SVs and SIs in machine learning that facilitates future research.

      <title>Extending Contextual Self-Modulation: Meta-Learning Across Modalities, Task Dimensionalities, and Data Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual Self-Modulation (CSM) is a potent regularization mechanism for the Neural Context Flow (NCF) framework which demonstrates powerful meta-learning of physical systems. However, CSM has limitations in its applicability across different modalities and in high-data regimes. In this work, we introduce two extensions: $i$CSM, which expands CSM to infinite-dimensional tasks, and StochasticNCF, which improves scalability. These extensions are demonstrated through comprehensive experimentation on a range of tasks, including dynamical systems with parameter variations, computer vision challenges, and curve fitting problems. $i$CSM embeds the contexts into an infinite-dimensional function space, as opposed to CSM which uses finite-dimensional context vectors. StochasticNCF enables the application of both CSM and $i$CSM to high-data scenarios by providing an unbiased approximation of meta-gradient updates through a sampled set of nearest environments. Additionally, we incorporate higher-order Taylor expansions via Taylor-Mode automatic differentiation, revealing that higher-order approximations do not necessarily enhance generalization. Finally, we demonstrate how CSM can be integrated into other meta-learning frameworks with FlashCAVIA, a computationally efficient extension of the CAVIA meta-learning framework (Zintgraf et al. 2019). FlashCAVIA outperforms its predecessor across various benchmarks and reinforces the utility of bi-level optimization techniques. Together, these contributions establish a robust framework for tackling an expanded spectrum of meta-learning tasks, offering practical insights for out-of-distribution generalization. Our open-sourced library, designed for flexible integration of self-modulation into contextual meta-learning workflows, is available at \url{github.com/ddrous/self-mod}.</description>

      <title>Conformal Generative Modeling with Improved Sample Efficiency through Sequential Greedy Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models lack rigorous statistical guarantees for their outputs and are therefore unreliable in safety-critical applications. In this work, we propose Sequential Conformal Prediction for Generative Models (SCOPE-Gen), a sequential conformal prediction method producing prediction sets that satisfy a rigorous statistical guarantee called conformal admissibility control. This guarantee states that with high probability, the prediction sets contain at least one admissible (or valid) example. To this end, our method first samples an initial set of i.i.d. examples from a black box generative model. Then, this set is iteratively pruned via so-called greedy filters. As a consequence of the iterative generation procedure, admissibility of the final prediction set factorizes as a Markov chain. This factorization is crucial, because it allows to control each factor separately, using conformal prediction. In comparison to prior work, our method demonstrates a large reduction in the number of admissibility evaluations during calibration. This reduction is important in safety-critical applications, where these evaluations must be conducted manually by domain experts and are therefore costly and time consuming. We highlight the advantages of our method in terms of admissibility evaluations and cardinality of the prediction sets through experiments in natural language generation and molecular graph extension tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparse Covariance Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of tabular data and achieve success in a variety of applications. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which the VNNs operate may contain many spurious correlations, making VNNs' performance inconsistent due to these noisy estimates and decreasing their computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix before convolution. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve covariance estimation and reduce computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. We show that S-VNNs are more stable than nominal VNNs as well as sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we provide novel connections between S-VNN stability and data distribution. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on various application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, stability, and computational efficiency of S-VNNs compared with nominal VNNs.</description>

      <title>VinePPO: Unlocking RL Potential For LLM Reasoning Through Refined Credit Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks that require executing several complex steps before receiving any reward. Properly assigning credit to these steps is essential for enhancing model performance. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm used for LLM finetuning, employs value networks to tackle credit assignment. However, value networks face challenges in predicting the expected cumulative rewards accurately in complex reasoning tasks, often leading to high-variance updates and suboptimal performance. In this work, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of value networks and reveal their significant shortcomings in reasoning-heavy LLM tasks, showing that they barely outperform a random baseline when comparing alternative steps. To address this, we propose VinePPO, a straightforward approach that leverages the flexibility of language environments to compute unbiased Monte Carlo-based estimates, bypassing the need for large value networks. Our method consistently outperforms PPO and other RL-free baselines across MATH and GSM8K datasets with fewer gradient updates (up to 9x), less wall-clock time (up to 3.0x). These results emphasize the importance of accurate credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLM and demonstrate VinePPO's potential as a superior alternative.</description>

      <title>PHI-S: Distribution Balancing for Label-Free Multi-Teacher Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various visual foundation models have distinct strengths and weaknesses, both of which can be improved through heterogeneous multi-teacher knowledge distillation without labels, termed "agglomerative models." We build upon this body of work by studying the effect of the teachers' activation statistics, particularly the impact of the loss function on the resulting student model quality. We explore a standard toolkit of statistical normalization techniques to better align the different distributions and assess their effects. Further, we examine the impact on downstream teacher-matching metrics, which motivates the use of Hadamard matrices. With these matrices, we demonstrate useful properties, showing how they can be used for isotropic standardization, where each dimension of a multivariate distribution is standardized using the same scale. We call this technique "PHI Standardization" (PHI-S) and empirically demonstrate that it produces the best student model across the suite of methods studied.</description>

      <title>Positional Attention: Out-of-Distribution Generalization and Expressivity for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to solve algorithmic tasks, such as arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting. While state-of-the-art models like Transformers have demonstrated good generalization performance on in-distribution tasks, their out-of-distribution (OOD) performance is poor when trained end-to-end. In this paper, we focus on value generalization, a common instance of OOD generalization where the test distribution has the same input sequence length as the training distribution, but the value ranges in the training and test distributions do not necessarily overlap. To address this issue, we propose that using fixed positional encodings to determine attention weights-referred to as positional attention-enhances empirical OOD performance while maintaining expressivity. We support our claim about expressivity by proving that Transformers with positional attention can effectively simulate parallel algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification with Bayesian Higher Order ReLU KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first method of uncertainty quantification in the domain of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, specifically focusing on (Higher Order) ReLUKANs to enhance computational efficiency given the computational demands of Bayesian methods. The method we propose is general in nature, providing access to both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. It is also capable of generalization to other various basis functions. We validate our method through a series of closure tests, including simple one-dimensional functions and application to the domain of (Stochastic) Partial Differential Equations. Referring to the latter, we demonstrate the method's ability to correctly identify functional dependencies introduced through the inclusion of a stochastic term.

      <title>MOREL: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness through Multi-Objective Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to slight adversarial perturbations$-$small changes to the input data that appear insignificant but cause the model to produce drastically different outputs. In addition to augmenting training data with adversarial examples generated from a specific attack method, most of the current defense strategies necessitate modifying the original model architecture components to improve robustness or performing test-time data purification to handle adversarial attacks. In this work, we demonstrate that strong feature representation learning during training can significantly enhance the original model's robustness. We propose MOREL, a multi-objective feature representation learning approach, encouraging classification models to produce similar features for inputs within the same class, despite perturbations. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering. Concurrently, the classifier is motivated to achieve accurate predictions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of DNNs against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks, outperforming other methods that similarly require no architectural changes or test-time data purification.

      <title>Performant, Memory Efficient and Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) progresses towards larger and more complex environments, achieving strong performance while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability to many agents becomes increasingly important. Although recent research has led to several advanced algorithms, to date, none fully address all of these key properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce Sable, a novel and theoretically sound algorithm that adapts the retention mechanism from Retentive Networks to MARL. Sable's retention-based sequence modelling architecture allows for computationally efficient scaling to a large number of agents, as well as maintaining a long temporal context, making it well-suited for large-scale partially observable environments. Through extensive evaluations across six diverse environments, we demonstrate how Sable is able to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in the majority of tasks (34 out of 45, roughly 75\%). Furthermore, Sable demonstrates stable performance as we scale the number of agents, handling environments with more than a thousand agents while exhibiting a linear increase in memory usage. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to isolate the source of Sable's performance gains and confirm its efficient computational memory usage. Our results highlight Sable's performance and efficiency, positioning it as a leading approach to MARL at scale.</description>

      <title>Meta-TTT: A Meta-learning Minimax Framework For Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time domain adaptation is a challenging task that aims to adapt a pre-trained model to limited, unlabeled target data during inference. Current methods that rely on self-supervision and entropy minimization underperform when the self-supervised learning (SSL) task does not align well with the primary objective. Additionally, minimizing entropy can lead to suboptimal solutions when there is limited diversity within minibatches. This paper introduces a meta-learning minimax framework for test-time training on batch normalization (BN) layers, ensuring that the SSL task aligns with the primary task while addressing minibatch overfitting. We adopt a mixed-BN approach that interpolates current test batch statistics with the statistics from source domains and propose a stochastic domain synthesizing method to improve model generalization and robustness to domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques across various domain adaptation and generalization benchmarks, significantly enhancing the pre-trained model's robustness on unseen domains.</description>

      <title>Automated Knowledge Concept Annotation and Question Representation Learning for Knowledge Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) is a popular approach for modeling students' learning progress over time, which can enable more personalized and adaptive learning. However, existing KT approaches face two major limitations: (1) they rely heavily on expert-defined knowledge concepts (KCs) in questions, which is time-consuming and prone to errors; and (2) KT methods tend to overlook the semantics of both questions and the given KCs. In this work, we address these challenges and present KCQRL, a framework for automated knowledge concept annotation and question representation learning that can improve the effectiveness of any existing KT model. First, we propose an automated KC annotation process using large language models (LLMs), which generates question solutions and then annotates KCs in each solution step of the questions. Second, we introduce a contrastive learning approach to generate semantically rich embeddings for questions and solution steps, aligning them with their associated KCs via a tailored false negative elimination approach. These embeddings can be readily integrated into existing KT models, replacing their randomly initialized embeddings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KCQRL across 15 KT algorithms on two large real-world Math learning datasets, where we achieve consistent performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Robustness of Reward Models for Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward models are key in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) systems, aligning the model behavior with human preferences. Particularly in the math domain, there have been plenty of studies using reward models to align policies for improving reasoning capabilities. Recently, as the importance of reward models has been emphasized, RewardBench is proposed to understand their behavior. However, we figure out that the math subset of RewardBench has different representations between chosen and rejected completions, and relies on a single comparison, which may lead to unreliable results as it only see an isolated case. Therefore, it fails to accurately present the robustness of reward models, leading to a misunderstanding of its performance and potentially resulting in reward hacking. In this work, we introduce a new design for reliable evaluation of reward models, and to validate this, we construct RewardMATH, a benchmark that effectively represents the robustness of reward models in mathematical reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the scores on RewardMATH strongly correlate with the results of optimized policy and effectively estimate reward overoptimization, whereas the existing benchmark shows almost no correlation. The results underscore the potential of our design to enhance the reliability of evaluation, and represent the robustness of reward model. We make our code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>PreND: Enhancing Intrinsic Motivation in Reinforcement Learning through Pre-trained Network Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic motivation, inspired by the psychology of developmental learning in infants, stimulates exploration in agents without relying solely on sparse external rewards. Existing methods in reinforcement learning like Random Network Distillation (RND) face significant limitations, including (1) relying on raw visual inputs, leading to a lack of meaningful representations, (2) the inability to build a robust latent space, (3) poor target network initialization and (4) rapid degradation of intrinsic rewards. In this paper, we introduce Pre-trained Network Distillation (PreND), a novel approach to enhance intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning (RL) by improving upon the widely used prediction-based method, RND. PreND addresses these challenges by incorporating pre-trained representation models into both the target and predictor networks, resulting in more meaningful and stable intrinsic rewards, while enhancing the representation learned by the model. We also tried simple but effective variants of the predictor network optimization by controlling the learning rate. Through experiments on the Atari domain, we demonstrate that PreND significantly outperforms RND, offering a more robust intrinsic motivation signal that leads to better exploration, improving overall performance and sample efficiency. This research highlights the importance of target and predictor networks representation in prediction-based intrinsic motivation, setting a new direction for improving RL agents' learning efficiency in sparse reward environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for learning operators between Banach spaces, based on the use of Leray-Schauder mappings to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of compact subspaces. We show that the resulting method is a universal approximator of (possibly nonlinear) operators. We demonstrate the efficiency of the approach on two benchmark datasets showing it achieves results comparable to state of the art models.</description>

      <title>Not All LLM Reasoners Are Created Equal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the depth of grade-school math (GSM) problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. To this end, we evaluate their performance on pairs of existing math word problems together so that the answer to the second problem depends on correctly answering the first problem. Our findings reveal a significant reasoning gap in most LLMs, that is performance difference between solving the compositional pairs and solving each question independently. This gap is more pronounced in smaller, more cost-efficient, and math-specialized models. Moreover, instruction-tuning recipes and code generation have varying effects across LLM sizes, while finetuning on GSM can lead to task overfitting. Our analysis indicates that large reasoning gaps are not because of test-set leakage, but due to distraction from additional context and poor second-hop reasoning. Overall, LLMs exhibit systematic differences in their reasoning abilities, despite what their performance on standard benchmarks indicates.</description>

      <title>TorchSISSO: A PyTorch-Based Implementation of the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator for Efficient and Interpretable Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) is a powerful machine learning approach that searches for both the structure and parameters of algebraic models, offering interpretable and compact representations of complex data. Unlike traditional regression methods, SR explores progressively complex feature spaces, which can uncover simple models that generalize well, even from small datasets. Among SR algorithms, the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) has proven particularly effective in the natural sciences, helping to rediscover fundamental physical laws as well as discover new interpretable equations for materials property modeling. However, its widespread adoption has been limited by performance inefficiencies and the challenges posed by its FORTRAN-based implementation, especially in modern computing environments. In this work, we introduce TorchSISSO, a native Python implementation built in the PyTorch framework. TorchSISSO leverages GPU acceleration, easy integration, and extensibility, offering a significant speed-up and improved accuracy over the original. We demonstrate that TorchSISSO matches or exceeds the performance of the original SISSO across a range of tasks, while dramatically reducing computational time and improving accessibility for broader scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Decision-Focused Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in ''decision-focused'' machine learning methods which train models to account for how their predictions are used in downstream optimization problems. Doing so can often improve performance on subsequent decision problems. However, current methods for uncertainty quantification do not incorporate any information at all about downstream decisions. We develop a framework based on conformal prediction to produce prediction sets that account for a downstream decision loss function, making them more appropriate to inform high-stakes decision-making. Our approach harnesses the strengths of conformal methods--modularity, model-agnosticism, and statistical coverage guarantees--while incorporating downstream decisions and user-specified utility functions. We prove that our methods retain standard coverage guarantees. Empirical evaluation across a range of datasets and utility metrics demonstrates that our methods achieve significantly lower decision loss compared to standard conformal methods. Additionally, we present a real-world use case in healthcare diagnosis, where our method effectively incorporates the hierarchical structure of dermatological diseases. It successfully generates sets with coherent diagnostic meaning, aiding the triage process during dermatology diagnosis and illustrating how our method can ground high-stakes decision-making on external domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Explainable Earth Surface Forecasting under Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With climate change-related extreme events on the rise, high dimensional Earth observation data presents a unique opportunity for forecasting and understanding impacts on ecosystems. This is, however, impeded by the complexity of processing, visualizing, modeling, and explaining this data. To showcase how this challenge can be met, here we train a convolutional long short-term memory-based architecture on the novel DeepExtremeCubes dataset. DeepExtremeCubes includes around 40,000 long-term Sentinel-2 minicubes (January 2016-October 2022) worldwide, along with labeled extreme events, meteorological data, vegetation land cover, and topography map, sampled from locations affected by extreme climate events and surrounding areas. When predicting future reflectances and vegetation impacts through kernel normalized difference vegetation index, the model achieved an R$^2$ score of 0.9055 in the test set. Explainable artificial intelligence was used to analyze the model's predictions during the October 2020 Central South America compound heatwave and drought event. We chose the same area exactly one year before the event as counterfactual, finding that the average temperature and surface pressure are generally the best predictors under normal conditions. In contrast, minimum anomalies of evaporation and surface latent heat flux take the lead during the event. A change of regime is also observed in the attributions before the event, which might help assess how long the event was brewing before happening.

      <title>Bayesian Binary Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Bayesian Binary Search (BBS), a novel probabilistic variant of the classical binary search/bisection algorithm. BBS leverages machine learning/statistical techniques to estimate the probability density of the search space and modifies the bisection step to split based on probability density rather than the traditional midpoint, allowing for the learned distribution of the search space to guide the search algorithm. Search space density estimation can flexibly be performed using supervised probabilistic machine learning techniques (e.g., Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural networks, quantile regression) or unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., Gaussian mixture models, kernel density estimation (KDE), maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)). We demonstrate significant efficiency gains of using BBS on both simulated data across a variety of distributions and in a real-world binary search use case of probing channel balances in the Bitcoin Lightning Network, for which we have deployed the BBS algorithm in a production setting.</description>

      <title>Trained Transformer Classifiers Generalize and Exhibit Benign Overfitting In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training ("in-context") examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example. A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares. In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks. Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time. We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit "benign overfitting in-context": when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples.</description>

      <title>TopER: Topological Embeddings in Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph embeddings play a critical role in graph representation learning, allowing machine learning models to explore and interpret graph-structured data. However, existing methods often rely on opaque, high-dimensional embeddings, limiting interpretability and practical visualization.
  In this work, we introduce Topological Evolution Rate (TopER), a novel, low-dimensional embedding approach grounded in topological data analysis. TopER simplifies a key topological approach, Persistent Homology, by calculating the evolution rate of graph substructures, resulting in intuitive and interpretable visualizations of graph data. This approach not only enhances the exploration of graph datasets but also delivers competitive performance in graph clustering and classification tasks. Our TopER-based models achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results across molecular, biological, and social network datasets in tasks such as classification, clustering, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.</description>

      <title>Learning To Solve Differential Equation Constrained Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations (DE) constrained optimization plays a critical role in numerous scientific and engineering fields, including energy systems, aerospace engineering, ecology, and finance, where optimal configurations or control strategies must be determined for systems governed by ordinary or stochastic differential equations. Despite its significance, the computational challenges associated with these problems have limited their practical use. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a learning-based approach to DE-constrained optimization that combines techniques from proxy optimization and neural differential equations. The proposed approach uses a dual-network architecture, with one approximating the control strategies, focusing on steady-state constraints, and another solving the associated DEs. This combination enables the approximation of optimal strategies while accounting for dynamic constraints in near real-time. Experiments across problems in energy optimization and finance modeling show that this method provides full compliance with dynamic constraints and it produces results up to 25 times more precise than other methods which do not explicitly model the system's dynamic equations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the alignment of Large Language Models according to human preferences. We discuss the features of training a Preference Model, which simulates human preferences, and the methods and details we found essential for achieving the best results. We also discuss using Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune Large Language Models and describe the challenges we faced and the ways to overcome them. Additionally, we present our experience with the Direct Preference Optimization method, which enables us to align a Large Language Model with human preferences without creating a separate Preference Model. As our contribution, we introduce the approach for collecting a preference dataset through perplexity filtering, which makes the process of creating such a dataset for a specific Language Model much easier and more cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Feature Selection and Engineering for Genotype Data with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting phenotypes with complex genetic bases based on a small, interpretable set of variant features remains a challenging task. Conventionally, data-driven approaches are utilized for this task, yet the high dimensional nature of genotype data makes the analysis and prediction difficult. Motivated by the extensive knowledge encoded in pre-trained LLMs and their success in processing complex biomedical concepts, we set to examine the ability of LLMs in feature selection and engineering for tabular genotype data, with a novel knowledge-driven framework. We develop FREEFORM, Free-flow Reasoning and Ensembling for Enhanced Feature Output and Robust Modeling, designed with chain-of-thought and ensembling principles, to select and engineer features with the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Evaluated on two distinct genotype-phenotype datasets, genetic ancestry and hereditary hearing loss, we find this framework outperforms several data-driven methods, particularly on low-shot regimes. FREEFORM is available as open-source framework at GitHub: https://github.com/PennShenLab/FREEFORM.</description>

      <title>Bellman Diffusion: Generative Modeling as Learning a Linear Operator in the Distribution Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Generative Models (DGMs), including Energy-Based Models (EBMs) and Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), have advanced high-fidelity data generation and complex continuous distribution approximation. However, their application in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), particularly in distributional Reinforcement Learning (RL), remains underexplored, with conventional histogram-based methods dominating the field. This paper rigorously highlights that this application gap is caused by the nonlinearity of modern DGMs, which conflicts with the linearity required by the Bellman equation in MDPs. For instance, EBMs involve nonlinear operations such as exponentiating energy functions and normalizing constants. To address this, we introduce Bellman Diffusion, a novel DGM framework that maintains linearity in MDPs through gradient and scalar field modeling. With divergence-based training techniques to optimize neural network proxies and a new type of stochastic differential equation (SDE) for sampling, Bellman Diffusion is guaranteed to converge to the target distribution. Our empirical results show that Bellman Diffusion achieves accurate field estimations and is a capable image generator, converging 1.5x faster than the traditional histogram-based baseline in distributional RL tasks. This work enables the effective integration of DGMs into MDP applications, unlocking new avenues for advanced decision-making frameworks.</description>

      <title>PROXI: Challenging the GNNs for Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have transformed graph representation learning. In the widely adopted message-passing GNN framework, nodes refine their representations by aggregating information from neighboring nodes iteratively. While GNNs excel in various domains, recent theoretical studies have raised concerns about their capabilities. GNNs aim to address various graph-related tasks by utilizing such node representations, however, this one-size-fits-all approach proves suboptimal for diverse tasks.
  Motivated by these observations, we conduct empirical tests to compare the performance of current GNN models with more conventional and direct methods in link prediction tasks. Introducing our model, PROXI, which leverages proximity information of node pairs in both graph and attribute spaces, we find that standard machine learning (ML) models perform competitively, even outperforming cutting-edge GNN models when applied to these proximity metrics derived from node neighborhoods and attributes. This holds true across both homophilic and heterophilic networks, as well as small and large benchmark datasets, including those from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Moreover, we show that augmenting traditional GNNs with PROXI significantly boosts their link prediction performance. Our empirical findings corroborate the previously mentioned theoretical observations and imply that there exists ample room for enhancement in current GNN models to reach their potential.</description>

      <title>On the expressiveness and spectral bias of KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) \cite{liu2024kan} were very recently proposed as a potential alternative to the prevalent architectural backbone of many deep learning models, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). KANs have seen success in various tasks of AI for science, with their empirical efficiency and accuracy demostrated in function regression, PDE solving, and many more scientific problems.
  In this article, we revisit the comparison of KANs and MLPs, with emphasis on a theoretical perspective. On the one hand, we compare the representation and approximation capabilities of KANs and MLPs. We establish that MLPs can be represented using KANs of a comparable size. This shows that the approximation and representation capabilities of KANs are at least as good as MLPs. Conversely, we show that KANs can be represented using MLPs, but that in this representation the number of parameters increases by a factor of the KAN grid size. This suggests that KANs with a large grid size may be more efficient than MLPs at approximating certain functions. On the other hand, from the perspective of learning and optimization, we study the spectral bias of KANs compared with MLPs. We demonstrate that KANs are less biased toward low frequencies than MLPs. We highlight that the multi-level learning feature specific to KANs, i.e. grid extension of splines, improves the learning process for high-frequency components. Detailed comparisons with different choices of depth, width, and grid sizes of KANs are made, shedding some light on how to choose the hyperparameters in practice.</description>

      <title>On the topology and geometry of population-based SHM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM), aims to leverage information across populations of structures in order to enhance diagnostics on those with sparse data. The discipline of transfer learning provides the mechanism for this capability. One recent paper in PBSHM proposed a geometrical view in which the structures were represented as graphs in a metric "base space" with their data captured in the "total space" of a vector bundle above the graph space. This view was more suggestive than mathematically rigorous, although it did allow certain useful arguments. One bar to more rigorous analysis was the absence of a meaningful topology on the graph space, and thus no useful notion of continuity. The current paper aims to address this problem, by moving to parametric families of structures in the base space, essentially changing points in the graph space to open balls. This allows the definition of open sets in the fibre space and thus allows continuous variation between fibres. The new ideas motivate a new geometrical mechanism for transfer learning in data are transported from one fibre to an adjacent one; i.e., from one structure to another.</description>

      <title>A Knowledge-Informed Large Language Model Framework for U.S. Nuclear Power Plant Shutdown Initiating Event Classification for Probabilistic Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and classifying shutdown initiating events (SDIEs) is critical for developing low power shutdown probabilistic risk assessment for nuclear power plants. Existing computational approaches cannot achieve satisfactory performance due to the challenges of unavailable large, labeled datasets, imbalanced event types, and label noise. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid pipeline that integrates a knowledge-informed machine learning mode to prescreen non-SDIEs and a large language model (LLM) to classify SDIEs into four types. In the prescreening stage, we proposed a set of 44 SDIE text patterns that consist of the most salient keywords and phrases from six SDIE types. Text vectorization based on the SDIE patterns generates feature vectors that are highly separable by using a simple binary classifier. The second stage builds Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based LLM, which learns generic English language representations from self-supervised pretraining on a large dataset and adapts to SDIE classification by fine-tuning it on an SDIE dataset. The proposed approaches are evaluated on a dataset with 10,928 events using precision, recall ratio, F1 score, and average accuracy. The results demonstrate that the prescreening stage can exclude more than 97% non-SDIEs, and the LLM achieves an average accuracy of 93.4% for SDIE classification.</description>

      <title>StreamEnsemble: Predictive Queries over Spatiotemporal Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive queries over spatiotemporal (ST) stream data pose significant data processing and analysis challenges. ST data streams involve a set of time series whose data distributions may vary in space and time, exhibiting multiple distinct patterns. In this context, assuming a single machine learning model would adequately handle such variations is likely to lead to failure. To address this challenge, we propose StreamEnsemble, a novel approach to predictive queries over ST data that dynamically selects and allocates Machine Learning models according to the underlying time series distributions and model characteristics. Our experimental evaluation reveals that this method markedly outperforms traditional ensemble methods and single model approaches in terms of accuracy and time, demonstrating a significant reduction in prediction error of more than 10 times compared to traditional approaches.</description>

      <title>AR-Sieve Bootstrap for the Random Forest and a simulation-based comparison with rangerts time series prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random Forest (RF) algorithm can be applied to a broad spectrum of problems, including time series prediction. However, neither the classical IID (Independent and Identically distributed) bootstrap nor block bootstrapping strategies (as implemented in rangerts) completely account for the nature of the Data Generating Process (DGP) while resampling the observations. We propose the combination of RF with a residual bootstrapping technique where we replace the IID bootstrap with the AR-Sieve Bootstrap (ARSB), which assumes the DGP to be an autoregressive process. To assess the new model's predictive performance, we conduct a simulation study using synthetic data generated from different types of DGPs. It turns out that ARSB provides more variation amongst the trees in the forest. Moreover, RF with ARSB shows greater accuracy compared to RF with other bootstrap strategies. However, these improvements are achieved at some efficiency costs.</description>

      <title>GAMMA-PD: Graph-based Analysis of Multi-Modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential increase in multi-modal medical data, including imaging, genomics, and electronic health records (EHRs). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a "hypernetwork" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

      <title>Evaluating Deep Regression Models for WSI-Based Gene-Expression Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction of mRNA gene-expression profiles directly from routine whole-slide images (WSIs) using deep learning models could potentially offer cost-effective and widely accessible molecular phenotyping. While such WSI-based gene-expression prediction models have recently emerged within computational pathology, the high-dimensional nature of the corresponding regression problem offers numerous design choices which remain to be analyzed in detail. This study provides recommendations on how deep regression models should be trained for WSI-based gene-expression prediction. For example, we conclude that training a single model to simultaneously regress all 20530 genes is a computationally efficient yet very strong baseline.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Sample Weighting for Interpretable Sub-cohort Analysis in Predictive Models for Neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in medicine have confirmed that brain disorders often comprise multiple subtypes of mechanisms, developmental trajectories, or severity levels. Such heterogeneity is often associated with demographic aspects (e.g., sex) or disease-related contributors (e.g., genetics). Thus, the predictive power of machine learning models used for symptom prediction varies across subjects based on such factors. To model this heterogeneity, one can assign each training sample a factor-dependent weight, which modulates the subject's contribution to the overall objective loss function. To this end, we propose to model the subject weights as a linear combination of the eigenbases of a spectral population graph that captures the similarity of factors across subjects. In doing so, the learned weights smoothly vary across the graph, highlighting sub-cohorts with high and low predictability. Our proposed sample weighting scheme is evaluated on two tasks. First, we predict initiation of heavy alcohol drinking in young adulthood from imaging and neuropsychological measures from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Next, we detect Dementia vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using imaging and demographic measurements in subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Compared to existing sample weighting schemes, our sample weights improve interpretability and highlight sub-cohorts with distinct characteristics and varying model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Compressing Recurrent Neural Networks for FPGA-accelerated Implementation in Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important technique for studying cellular environments and molecular interactions, but its real-time application is limited by slow data acquisition, which requires capturing large time-resolved images and complex post-processing using iterative fitting algorithms. Deep learning (DL) models enable real-time inference, but can be computationally demanding due to complex architectures and large matrix operations. This makes DL models ill-suited for direct implementation on field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based camera hardware. Model compression is thus crucial for practical deployment for real-time inference generation. In this work, we focus on compressing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are well-suited for FLI time-series data processing, to enable deployment on resource-constrained FPGA boards. We perform an empirical evaluation of various compression techniques, including weight reduction, knowledge distillation (KD), post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT), to reduce model size and computational load while preserving inference accuracy. Our compressed RNN model, Seq2SeqLite, achieves a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly at 8-bit precision. By applying KD, the model parameter size was reduced by 98\% while retaining performance, making it suitable for concurrent real-time FLI analysis on FPGA during data capture. This work represents a big step towards integrating hardware-accelerated real-time FLI analysis for fast biological processes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Intrusion Detection for Enhancing Internet of Things Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attacks against the Internet of Things (IoT) are rising as devices, applications, and interactions become more networked and integrated. The increase in cyber-attacks that target IoT networks poses a huge vulnerability and threat to the privacy, security, functionality, and availability of critical systems, which leads to operational disruptions, financial losses, identity thefts, and data breaches. To efficiently secure IoT devices, real-time detection of intrusion systems is critical, especially those using machine learning to identify threats and mitigate risks and vulnerabilities. This paper investigates the latest research on machine learning-based intrusion detection strategies for IoT security, concentrating on real-time responsiveness, detection accuracy, and algorithm efficiency. Key studies were reviewed from all well-known academic databases, and a taxonomy was provided for the existing approaches. This review also highlights existing research gaps and outlines the limitations of current IoT security frameworks to offer practical insights for future research directions and developments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Synergistic Effects of Dropout and Residual Connections on Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: This paper examines the pivotal role of dropout techniques in mitigating overfitting in language model training. It conducts a comprehensive investigation into the influence of variable dropout rates on both individual layers and residual connections within the context of language modeling. Our study conducts training of a decoder implementation on the classic Tiny Shakespeare data to examine the effects of the adjustments on training efficiency and validation error. Results not only confirm the benefits of dropout for regularization and residuals for convergence, but also reveal their interesting interactions. There exists an important trade-off between the depth of residual connections and the dropout on these connections for optimal deep neural network convergence and generalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mastering complex sequential tasks continues to pose a significant challenge in robotics. While there has been progress in learning long-horizon manipulation tasks, most existing approaches lack rigorous mathematical guarantees for ensuring reliable and successful execution. In this paper, we extend previous work on learning long-horizon tasks and stable policies, focusing on improving task success rates while reducing the amount of training data needed. Our approach introduces a novel method that (1) segments long-horizon demonstrations into discrete steps defined by waypoints and subgoals, and (2) learns globally stable dynamical system policies to guide the robot to each subgoal, even in the face of sensory noise and random disturbances. We validate our approach through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating effective transfer from simulation to physical robotic platforms.

      <title>Uncertainty Modelling and Robust Observer Synthesis using the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust nonlinear observer synthesis method for a population of systems modelled using the Koopman operator. The Koopman operator allows nonlinear systems to be rewritten as infinite-dimensional linear systems. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified directly from data, yielding an approximately linear model of a nonlinear system. The proposed observer synthesis method is made possible by this linearity that in turn allows uncertainty within a population of Koopman models to be quantified in the frequency domain. Using this uncertainty model, linear robust control techniques are used to synthesize robust nonlinear Koopman observers. A population of several dozen motor drives is used to experimentally demonstrate the proposed method. Manufacturing variation is characterized in the frequency domain, and a robust Koopman observer is synthesized using mixed $\mathcal{H}_2$-$\mathcal{H}_\infty$ optimal control.</description>

      <title>Deep Nets with Subsampling Layers Unwittingly Discard Useful Activations at Test-Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsampling layers play a crucial role in deep nets by discarding a portion of an activation map to reduce its spatial dimensions. This encourages the deep net to learn higher-level representations. Contrary to this motivation, we hypothesize that the discarded activations are useful and can be incorporated on the fly to improve models' prediction. To validate our hypothesis, we propose a search and aggregate method to find useful activation maps to be used at test time. We applied our approach to the task of image classification and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments over nine different architectures on multiple datasets show that our method consistently improves model test-time performance, complementing existing test-time augmentation techniques. Our code is available at https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/discard-in-subsampling.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications involve reasoning about time durations before a critical event happens--also called time-to-event outcomes. When will a customer cancel a subscription, a coma patient wake up, or a convicted criminal reoffend? Time-to-event outcomes have been studied extensively within the field of survival analysis primarily by the statistical, medical, and reliability engineering communities, with textbooks already available in the 1970s and '80s. This monograph aims to provide a reasonably self-contained modern introduction to survival analysis. We focus on predicting time-to-event outcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks. Our goal is to provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely what the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from standard regression and classification, and how key "design patterns" have been used time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models, from classical methods like the Cox proportional hazards model to modern deep learning approaches such as deep kernel Kaplan-Meier estimators and neural ordinary differential equation models. We further delve into two extensions of the basic time-to-event prediction setup: predicting which of several critical events will happen first along with the time until this earliest event happens (the competing risks setting), and predicting time-to-event outcomes given a time series that grows in length over time (the dynamic setting). We conclude with a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning, interpretability, and statistical guarantees. Our monograph comes with an accompanying code repository that implements every model and evaluation metric that we cover in detail.</description>

      <title>Exploring Empty Spaces: Human-in-the-Loop Data Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial to make machine learning models more robust and safe. However, augmenting data can be challenging as it requires generating diverse data points to rigorously evaluate model behavior on edge cases and mitigate potential harms. Creating high-quality augmentations that cover these "unknown unknowns" is a time- and creativity-intensive task. In this work, we introduce Amplio, an interactive tool to help practitioners navigate "unknown unknowns" in unstructured text datasets and improve data diversity by systematically identifying empty data spaces to explore. Amplio includes three human-in-the-loop data augmentation techniques: Augment With Concepts, Augment by Interpolation, and Augment with Large Language Model. In a user study with 18 professional red teamers, we demonstrate the utility of our augmentation methods in helping generate high-quality, diverse, and relevant model safety prompts. We find that Amplio enabled red teamers to augment data quickly and creatively, highlighting the transformative potential of interactive augmentation workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high-dimensional, ridge-regularized logistic regression in a setting in which the covariates may be missing or corrupted by additive noise. When both the covariates and the additive corruptions are independent and normally distributed, we provide exact characterizations of both the prediction error as well as the estimation error. Moreover, we show that these characterizations are universal: as long as the entries of the data matrix satisfy a set of independence and moment conditions, our guarantees continue to hold. Universality, in turn, enables the detailed study of several imputation-based strategies when the covariates are missing completely at random. We ground our study by comparing the performance of these strategies with the conjectured performance -- stemming from replica theory in statistical physics -- of the Bayes optimal procedure. Our analysis yields several insights including: (i) a distinction between single imputation and a simple variant of multiple imputation and (ii) that adding a simple ridge regularization term to single-imputed logistic regression can yield an estimator whose prediction error is nearly indistinguishable from the Bayes optimal prediction error. We supplement our findings with extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Using Interleaved Ensemble Unlearning to Keep Backdoors at Bay for Finetuning Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become popular in computer vision tasks. Backdoor attacks, which trigger undesirable behaviours in models during inference, threaten ViTs' performance, particularly in security-sensitive tasks. Although backdoor defences have been developed for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they are less effective for ViTs, and defences tailored to ViTs are scarce. To address this, we present Interleaved Ensemble Unlearning (IEU), a method for finetuning clean ViTs on backdoored datasets. In stage 1, a shallow ViT is finetuned to have high confidence on backdoored data and low confidence on clean data. In stage 2, the shallow ViT acts as a ``gate'' to block potentially poisoned data from the defended ViT. This data is added to an unlearn set and asynchronously unlearned via gradient ascent. We demonstrate IEU's effectiveness on three datasets against 11 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks and show its versatility by applying it to different model architectures.</description>

      <title>[Re] Network Deconvolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work aims to reproduce the set of findings published in "Network Deconvolution" by Ye et al. (2020)[1]. That paper proposes an optimization technique for model training in convolutional neural networks. The proposed technique "network deconvolution" is used in convolutional neural networks to remove pixel-wise and channel-wise correlations before data is fed into each layer. In particular, we interrogate the validity of the authors' claim that using network deconvolution instead of batch normalization improves deep learning model performance. Our effort confirms the validity of this claim, successfully reproducing the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 of the original paper. Our study involved 367 unique experiments across multiple architectures, datasets, and hyper parameter configurations. For Table 1, while there were some minor deviations in accuracy when compared to the original values (within 10%), the overall trend was consistent with the original study's findings when training the models with epochs 20 and 100. For Table 2, all 14 reproduced values were consistent with the original values. Additionally, we document the training and testing times for each architecture in Table 1 with 1, 20, and 100 epoch settings for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We document the total execution times for Table 2 architectures with the ImageNet dataset. The data and software used for this reproducibility study are publicly available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/rep-network-deconvolution.</description>

      <title>Diverse Expected Improvement (DEI): Diverse Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Computer Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box simulators arises in a myriad of modern scientific and engineering applications. Bayesian optimization provides an appealing solution, by leveraging a fitted surrogate model to guide the selection of subsequent simulator evaluations. In practice, however, the objective is often not to obtain a single good solution, but rather a ''basket'' of good solutions from which users can choose for downstream decision-making. This need arises in our motivating application for real-time control of internal combustion engines for flight propulsion, where a diverse set of control strategies is essential for stable flight control. There has been little work on this front for Bayesian optimization. We thus propose a new Diverse Expected Improvement (DEI) method that searches for diverse ''$\epsilon$-optimal'' solutions: locally-optimal solutions within a tolerance level $\epsilon &gt; 0$ from a global optimum. We show that DEI yields a closed-form acquisition function under a Gaussian process surrogate model, which facilitates efficient sequential queries via automatic differentiation. This closed form further reveals a novel exploration-exploitation-diversity trade-off, which incorporates the desired diversity property within the well-known exploration-exploitation trade-off. We demonstrate the improvement of DEI over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments, then explore the DEI in two applications on rover trajectory optimization and engine control for flight propulsion.</description>

      <title>Effective Tuning Strategies for Generalist Robot Manipulation Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalist robot manipulation policies (GMPs) have the potential to generalize across a wide range of tasks, devices, and environments. However, existing policies continue to struggle with out-of-distribution scenarios due to the inherent difficulty of collecting sufficient action data to cover extensively diverse domains. While fine-tuning offers a practical way to quickly adapt a GMPs to novel domains and tasks with limited samples, we observe that the performance of the resulting GMPs differs significantly with respect to the design choices of fine-tuning strategies. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth empirical study to investigate the effect of key factors in GMPs fine-tuning strategies, covering the action space, policy head, supervision signal and the choice of tunable parameters, where 2,500 rollouts are evaluated for a single configuration. We systematically discuss and summarize our findings and identify the key design choices, which we believe give a practical guideline for GMPs fine-tuning. We observe that in a low-data regime, with carefully chosen fine-tuning strategies, a GMPs significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms. The results presented in this work establish a new baseline for future studies on fine-tuned GMPs, and provide a significant addition to the GMPs toolbox for the community.</description>

      <title>Statistical Taylor Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical Taylor expansion replaces the input precise variables in a conventional Taylor expansion with random variables each with known mean and deviation, to calculate the result mean and deviation. It is based on the uncorrelated uncertainty assumption: Each input variable is measured independently with fine enough statistical precision, so that their uncertainties are independent of each other. Statistical Taylor expansion reviews that the intermediate analytic expressions can no longer be regarded as independent of each other, and the result of analytic expression should be path independent. This conclusion differs fundamentally from the conventional common approach in applied mathematics to find the best execution path for a result. This paper also presents an implementation of statistical Taylor expansion called variance arithmetic, and the tests on variance arithmetic.</description>

      <title>ConServe: Harvesting GPUs for Low-Latency and High-Throughput Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many applications are leveraging large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks, and they generally demand low inference latency and high serving throughput for interactive online jobs such as chatbots. However, the tight latency requirement and high load variance of applications pose challenges to serving systems in achieving high GPU utilization. Due to the high costs of scheduling and preemption, today's systems generally use separate clusters to serve online and offline inference tasks, and dedicate GPUs for online inferences to avoid interference. This approach leads to underutilized GPUs because one must reserve enough GPU resources for the peak expected load, even if the average load is low.
  This paper proposes to harvest stranded GPU resources for offline LLM inference tasks such as document summarization and LLM benchmarking. Unlike online inferences, these tasks usually run in a batch-processing manner with loose latency requirements, making them a good fit for stranded resources that are only available shortly. To enable safe and efficient GPU harvesting without interfering with online tasks, we built ConServe, an LLM serving system that contains (1) an execution engine that preempts running offline tasks upon the arrival of online tasks, (2) an incremental checkpointing mechanism that minimizes the amount of recomputation required by preemptions, and (3) a scheduler that adaptively batches offline tasks for higher GPU utilization. Our evaluation demonstrates that ConServe achieves strong performance isolation when co-serving online and offline tasks but at a much higher GPU utilization. When colocating practical online and offline workloads on popular models such as Llama-2-7B, ConServe achieves 2.35$\times$ higher throughput than state-of-the-art online serving systems and reduces serving latency by 84$\times$ compared to existing co-serving systems.</description>

      <title>Equivariant score-based generative models provably learn distributions with symmetries efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is ubiquitous in many real-world phenomena and tasks, such as physics, images, and molecular simulations. Empirical studies have demonstrated that incorporating symmetries into generative models can provide better generalization and sampling efficiency when the underlying data distribution has group symmetry. In this work, we provide the first theoretical analysis and guarantees of score-based generative models (SGMs) for learning distributions that are invariant with respect to some group symmetry and offer the first quantitative comparison between data augmentation and adding equivariant inductive bias. First, building on recent works on the Wasserstein-1 ($\mathbf{d}_1$) guarantees of SGMs and empirical estimations of probability divergences under group symmetry, we provide an improved $\mathbf{d}_1$ generalization bound when the data distribution is group-invariant. Second, we describe the inductive bias of equivariant SGMs using Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theory, and rigorously demonstrate that one can learn the score of a symmetrized distribution using equivariant vector fields without data augmentations through the analysis of the optimality and equivalence of score-matching objectives. This also provides practical guidance that one does not have to augment the dataset as long as the vector field or the neural network parametrization is equivariant. Moreover, we quantify the impact of not incorporating equivariant structure into the score parametrization, by showing that non-equivariant vector fields can yield worse generalization bounds. This can be viewed as a type of model-form error that describes the missing structure of non-equivariant vector fields. Numerical simulations corroborate our analysis and highlight that data augmentations cannot replace the role of equivariant vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant quantum neural networks (QNNs) are promising quantum machine learning models that exploit symmetries to provide potential quantum advantages. Despite theoretical developments in equivariant QNNs, their implementation on near-term quantum devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources. This study proposes a resource-efficient model of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) called equivariant split-parallelizing QCNN (sp-QCNN). Using a group-theoretical approach, we encode general symmetries into our model beyond the translational symmetry addressed by previous sp-QCNNs. We achieve this by splitting the circuit at the pooling layer while preserving symmetry. This splitting structure effectively parallelizes QCNNs to improve measurement efficiency in estimating the expectation value of an observable and its gradient by order of the number of qubits. Our model also exhibits high trainability and generalization performance, including the absence of barren plateaus. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the equivariant sp-QCNN can be trained and generalized with fewer measurement resources than a conventional equivariant QCNN in a noisy quantum data classification task. Our results contribute to the advancement of practical quantum machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Optimism and Model Complexity in the Wake of Overparameterized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common practice in modern machine learning involves fitting a large number of parameters relative to the number of observations. These overparameterized models can exhibit surprising generalization behavior, e.g., ``double descent'' in the prediction error curve when plotted against the raw number of model parameters, or another simplistic notion of complexity. In this paper, we revisit model complexity from first principles, by first reinterpreting and then extending the classical statistical concept of (effective) degrees of freedom. Whereas the classical definition is connected to fixed-X prediction error (in which prediction error is defined by averaging over the same, nonrandom covariate points as those used during training), our extension of degrees of freedom is connected to random-X prediction error (in which prediction error is averaged over a new, random sample from the covariate distribution). The random-X setting more naturally embodies modern machine learning problems, where highly complex models, even those complex enough to interpolate the training data, can still lead to desirable generalization performance under appropriate conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed complexity measures through a mix of conceptual arguments, theory, and experiments, and illustrate how they can be used to interpret and compare arbitrary prediction models.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of Multi Diffusion Models for Enhancing Learned Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, particularly with the various applications of classifier-free guidance conditional diffusion models. While many diffusion models perform well when controlling for particular aspect among style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, Aggregation of Multi Diffusion Models (AMDM), which synthesizes features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model, enhancing its learned representations to activate specific features for fine-grained control. AMDM consists of two key components: spherical aggregation and manifold optimization. Spherical aggregation merges intermediate variables from different diffusion models with minimal manifold deviation, while manifold optimization refines these variables to align with the intermediate data manifold, enhancing sampling quality. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without additional training or inference time, proving its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional control generation in diffusion models: We can fully utilize existing conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, or develop new ones, and then aggregate them using the AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs.

      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>"No Matter What You Do!": Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have exposed that GNNs are vulnerable to several adversarial attacks, among which backdoor attack is one of the toughest. Similar to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), backdoor attacks in GNNs lie in the fact that the attacker modifies a portion of graph data by embedding triggers and enforces the model to learn the trigger feature during the model training process. Despite the massive prior backdoor defense works on DNNs, defending against backdoor attacks in GNNs is largely unexplored, severely hindering the widespread application of GNNs in real-world tasks. To bridge this gap, we present GCleaner, the first backdoor mitigation method on GNNs. GCleaner can mitigate the presence of the backdoor logic within backdoored GNNs by reversing the backdoor learning procedure, aiming to restore the model performance to a level similar to that is directly trained on the original clean dataset. To achieve this objective, we ask: How to recover universal and hard backdoor triggers in GNNs? How to unlearn the backdoor trigger feature while maintaining the model performance? We conduct the graph trigger recovery via the explanation method to identify optimal trigger locations, facilitating the search of universal and hard backdoor triggers in the feature space of the backdoored model through maximal similarity. Subsequently, we introduce the backdoor unlearning mechanism, which combines knowledge distillation and gradient-based explainable knowledge for fine-grained backdoor erasure. Extensive experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCleaner can reduce the backdoor attack success rate to 10% with only 1% of clean data, and has almost negligible degradation in model performance, which far outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods.</description>

      <title>CANVAS: Commonsense-Aware Navigation System for Intuitive Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-life robot navigation involves more than just reaching a destination; it requires optimizing movements while addressing scenario-specific goals. An intuitive way for humans to express these goals is through abstract cues like verbal commands or rough sketches. Such human guidance may lack details or be noisy. Nonetheless, we expect robots to navigate as intended. For robots to interpret and execute these abstract instructions in line with human expectations, they must share a common understanding of basic navigation concepts with humans. To this end, we introduce CANVAS, a novel framework that combines visual and linguistic instructions for commonsense-aware navigation. Its success is driven by imitation learning, enabling the robot to learn from human navigation behavior. We present COMMAND, a comprehensive dataset with human-annotated navigation results, spanning over 48 hours and 219 km, designed to train commonsense-aware navigation systems in simulated environments. Our experiments show that CANVAS outperforms the strong rule-based system ROS NavStack across all environments, demonstrating superior performance with noisy instructions. Notably, in the orchard environment, where ROS NavStack records a 0% total success rate, CANVAS achieves a total success rate of 67%. CANVAS also closely aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, even in unseen environments. Furthermore, real-world deployment of CANVAS showcases impressive Sim2Real transfer with a total success rate of 69%, highlighting the potential of learning from human demonstrations in simulated environments for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Human Mobility Modeling and Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the GPS coordinates of a large collection of human agents over time, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly detection (e.g. for bad-actor or malicious behavior detection) without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been studied extensively with varying capacity to handle complex input, and performance-efficiency trade-offs. With the arrival of more expressive models in machine learning, we attempt to model GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each with a set of characterizing spatiotemporal features, and leverage modern sequence models such as Transformers for un/self-supervised training and inference. Notably, driven by the inherent stochasticity of certain individuals' behavior, we equip our model with aleatoric/data uncertainty estimation. In addition, to handle data sparsity of a large variety of behaviors, we incorporate epistemic/model uncertainty into our model. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty enable a robust loss and training dynamics, as well as uncertainty-aware decision making in anomaly scoring. Experiments on large expert-simulated datasets with tens of thousands of agents demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against both forecasting and anomaly detection baselines.</description>

      <title>Deep Kernel Posterior Learning under Infinite Variance Prior Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neal (1996) proved that infinitely wide shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNN) converge to Gaussian processes (GP), when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Cho &amp; Saul (2009) provided a useful recursive formula for deep kernel processes for relating the covariance kernel of each layer to the layer immediately below. Moreover, they worked out the form of the layer-wise covariance kernel in an explicit manner for several common activation functions. Recent works, including Aitchison et al. (2021), have highlighted that the covariance kernels obtained in this manner are deterministic and hence, precludes any possibility of representation learning, which amounts to learning a non-degenerate posterior of a random kernel given the data. To address this, they propose adding artificial noise to the kernel to retain stochasticity, and develop deep kernel inverse Wishart processes. Nonetheless, this artificial noise injection could be critiqued in that it would not naturally emerge in a classic BNN architecture under an infinite-width limit. To address this, we show that a Bayesian deep neural network, where each layer width approaches infinity, and all network weights are elliptically distributed with infinite variance, converges to a process with $\alpha$-stable marginals in each layer that has a conditionally Gaussian representation. These conditional random covariance kernels could be recursively linked in the manner of Cho &amp; Saul (2009), even though marginally the process exhibits stable behavior, and hence covariances are not even necessarily defined. We also provide useful generalizations of the recent results of Lor\'ia &amp; Bhadra (2024) on shallow networks to multi-layer networks, and remedy the computational burden of their approach. The computational and statistical benefits over competing approaches stand out in simulations and in demonstrations on benchmark data sets.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Copy Bias in In-Context Learning through Neuron Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive few-shot in-context learning (ICL) abilities. Still, we show that they are sometimes prone to a `copying bias', where they copy answers from provided examples instead of learning the underlying patterns. In this work, we propose a novel and simple method to mitigate such copying bias. First, we create a synthetic task and use the Integrated Gradients method to identify neurons that prioritize copying over generalization. We demonstrate that pruning these neurons consistently improves performance across a diverse set of ICL tasks. We also show that our method is applicable across various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State-Space Models, without requiring modifications. In our analysis, we adopt a task-recognition perspective on ICL and examine task vectors (Hendel et al., 2023) induced by the model. We find that pruning enhances the quality of these vectors, suggesting that the pruned neurons previously hindered effective task recognition.</description>

      <title>Towards a Law of Iterated Expectations for Heuristic Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Christiano et al. (2022) define a *heuristic estimator* to be a hypothetical algorithm that estimates the values of mathematical expressions from arguments. In brief, a heuristic estimator $\mathbb{G}$ takes as input a mathematical expression $Y$ and a formal "heuristic argument" $\pi$, and outputs an estimate $\mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi)$ of $Y$. In this work, we argue for the informal principle that a heuristic estimator ought not to be able to predict its own errors, and we explore approaches to formalizing this principle. Most simply, the principle suggests that $\mathbb{G}(Y - \mathbb{G}(Y \mid \pi) \mid \pi)$ ought to equal zero for all $Y$ and $\pi$. We argue that an ideal heuristic estimator ought to satisfy two stronger properties in this vein, which we term *iterated estimation* (by analogy to the law of iterated expectations) and *error orthogonality*.
  Although iterated estimation and error orthogonality are intuitively appealing, it can be difficult to determine whether a given heuristic estimator satisfies the properties. As an alternative approach, we explore *accuracy*: a property that (roughly) states that $\mathbb{G}$ has zero average error over a distribution of mathematical expressions. However, in the context of two estimation problems, we demonstrate barriers to creating an accurate heuristic estimator. We finish by discussing challenges and potential paths forward for finding a heuristic estimator that accords with our intuitive understanding of how such an estimator ought to behave, as well as the potential applications of heuristic estimators to understanding the behavior of neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is the task of assigning labels to a text within a structured space organized as a hierarchy. Recent works treat HTC as a conventional multilabel classification problem, therefore evaluating it as such. We instead propose to evaluate models based on specifically designed hierarchical metrics and we demonstrate the intricacy of metric choice and prediction inference method. We introduce a new challenging dataset and we evaluate fairly, recent sophisticated models, comparing them with a range of simple but strong baselines, including a new theoretically motivated loss. Finally, we show that those baselines are very often competitive with the latest models. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the evaluation methodology when proposing new methods for HTC. Code implementation and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/RomanPlaud/revisitingHTC}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for compressing neural network weights, such as decomposition, pruning, quantization, and channel simulation, often overlook the inherent symmetries within these networks and thus waste bits on encoding redundant information. In this paper, we propose a format based on bits-back coding for storing rotationally symmetric Transformer weights more efficiently than the usual array layout at the same floating-point precision. We evaluate our method on Large Language Models (LLMs) pruned by SliceGPT (Ashkboos et al., 2024) and achieve a 3-5% reduction in total bit usage for free across different model sizes and architectures without impacting model performance within a certain numerical precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast computation of large kernel sums is a challenging task, which arises as a subproblem in any kernel method. We approach the problem by slicing, which relies on random projections to one-dimensional subspaces and fast Fourier summation. We prove bounds for the slicing error and propose a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approach for selecting the projections based on spherical quadrature rules. Numerical examples demonstrate that our QMC-slicing approach significantly outperforms existing methods like (QMC-)random Fourier features, orthogonal Fourier features or non-QMC slicing on standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>Layer Swapping for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</description>

      <title>Response Estimation and System Identification of Dynamical Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate modelling of structural dynamics is crucial across numerous engineering applications, such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), seismic analysis, and vibration control. Often, these models originate from physics-based principles and can be derived from corresponding governing equations, often of differential equation form. However, complex system characteristics, such as nonlinearities and energy dissipation mechanisms, often imply that such models are approximative and often imprecise. This challenge is further compounded in SHM, where sensor data is often sparse, making it difficult to fully observe the system's states. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a class of physics-enhanced machine learning (PEML) techniques, for the identification and estimation of dynamical systems. PINNs offer a unique advantage by embedding known physical laws directly into the neural network's loss function, allowing for simple embedding of complex phenomena, even in the presence of uncertainties. This study specifically investigates three key applications of PINNs: state estimation in systems with sparse sensing, joint state-parameter estimation, when both system response and parameters are unknown, and parameter estimation within a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainties. The results demonstrate that PINNs deliver an efficient tool across all aforementioned tasks, even in presence of modelling errors. However, these errors tend to have a more significant impact on parameter estimation, as the optimization process must reconcile discrepancies between the prescribed model and the true system behavior. Despite these challenges, PINNs show promise in dynamical system modeling, offering a robust approach to handling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Overpredictive Signal Analytics in Federated Learning: Algorithms and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge signal processing facilitates distributed learning and inference in the client-server model proposed in federated learning. In traditional machine learning, clients (IoT devices) that acquire raw signal samples can aid a data center (server) learn a global signal model by pooling these distributed samples at a third-party location. Despite the promising capabilities of IoTs, these distributed deployments often face the challenge of sensitive private data and communication rate constraints. This necessitates a learning approach that communicates a processed approximation of the distributed samples instead of the raw signals. Such a decentralized learning approach using signal approximations will be termed distributed signal analytics in this work. Overpredictive signal approximations may be desired for distributed signal analytics, especially in network demand (capacity) planning applications motivated by federated learning. In this work, we propose algorithms that compute an overpredictive signal approximation at the client devices using an efficient convex optimization framework. Tradeoffs between communication cost, sampling rate, and the signal approximation error are quantified using mathematical analysis. We also show the performance of the proposed distributed algorithms on a publicly available residential energy consumption dataset.</description>

      <title>The Labyrinth of Links: Navigating the Associative Maze of Multi-modal LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive capability. However, recently many deficiencies of MLLMs have been found compared to human intelligence, $\textit{e.g.}$, hallucination. To drive the MLLMs study, the community dedicated efforts to building larger benchmarks with complex tasks. In this paper, we propose benchmarking an essential but usually overlooked intelligence: $\textbf{association}$, a human's basic capability to link observation and prior practice memory. To comprehensively investigate MLLM's performance on the association, we formulate the association task and devise a standard benchmark based on adjective and verb semantic concepts. Instead of costly data annotation and curation, we propose a convenient $\textbf{annotation-free}$ construction method transforming the general dataset for our association tasks. Simultaneously, we devise a rigorous data refinement process to eliminate confusion in the raw dataset. Building on this database, we establish three levels of association tasks: single-step, synchronous, and asynchronous associations. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the MLLMs' zero-shot association capabilities, addressing multiple dimensions, including three distinct memory strategies, both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, cutting-edge Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and the involvement of human experts. Our systematic investigation shows that current open-source MLLMs consistently exhibit poor capability in our association tasks, even the currently state-of-the-art GPT-4V(vision) also has a significant gap compared to humans. We believe our benchmark would pave the way for future MLLM studies. $\textit{Our data and code are available at:}$ https://mvig-rhos.com/llm_inception.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop Long-horizon Robotic Planning via Equilibrium Sequence Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the endeavor to make autonomous robots take actions, task planning is a major challenge that requires translating high-level task descriptions into long-horizon action sequences. Despite recent advances in language model agents, they remain prone to planning errors and limited in their ability to plan ahead. To address these limitations in robotic planning, we advocate a self-refining scheme that iteratively refines a draft plan until an equilibrium is reached. Remarkably, this process can be optimized end-to-end from an analytical perspective without the need to curate additional verifiers or reward models, allowing us to train self-refining planners in a simple supervised learning fashion. Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling procedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates useful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method is evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance with better scaling for inference computation.

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositionality, the notion that the meaning of an expression is constructed from the meaning of its parts and syntactic rules, permits the infinite productivity of human language. For the first time, artificial language models (LMs) are able to match human performance in a number of compositional generalization tasks. However, much remains to be understood about the representational mechanisms underlying these abilities. We take a high-level geometric approach to this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimensionality of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' intrinsic dimensionality, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between linear and nonlinear dimensionality, showing that they respectively encode formal and semantic aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

      <title>From Reward Shaping to Q-Shaping: Achieving Unbiased Learning with LLM-Guided Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-shaping is an extension of Q-value initialization and serves as an alternative to reward shaping for incorporating domain knowledge to accelerate agent training, thereby improving sample efficiency by directly shaping Q-values. This approach is both general and robust across diverse tasks, allowing for immediate impact assessment while guaranteeing optimality. We evaluated Q-shaping across 20 different environments using a large language model (LLM) as the heuristic provider. The results demonstrate that Q-shaping significantly enhances sample efficiency, achieving a \textbf{16.87\%} improvement over the best baseline in each environment and a \textbf{253.80\%} improvement compared to LLM-based reward shaping methods. These findings establish Q-shaping as a superior and unbiased alternative to conventional reward shaping in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Introducing Flexible Monotone Multiple Choice Item Response Theory Models and Bit Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) is a powerful statistical approach for evaluating test items and determining test taker abilities through response analysis. An IRT model that better fits the data leads to more accurate latent trait estimates. In this study, we present a new model for multiple choice data, the monotone multiple choice (MMC) model, which we fit using autoencoders. Using both simulated scenarios and real data from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test, we demonstrate empirically that the MMC model outperforms the traditional nominal response IRT model in terms of fit. Furthermore, we illustrate how the latent trait scale from any fitted IRT model can be transformed into a ratio scale, aiding in score interpretation and making it easier to compare different types of IRT models. We refer to these new scales as bit scales. Bit scales are especially useful for models for which minimal or no assumptions are made for the latent trait scale distributions, such as for the autoencoder fitted models in this study.</description>

      <title>One Wave to Explain Them All: A Unifying Perspective on Post-hoc Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the growing use of deep neural networks in safety-critical decision-making, their inherent black-box nature hinders transparency and interpretability. Explainable AI (XAI) methods have thus emerged to understand a model's internal workings, and notably attribution methods also called saliency maps. Conventional attribution methods typically identify the locations -- the where -- of significant regions within an input. However, because they overlook the inherent structure of the input data, these methods often fail to interpret what these regions represent in terms of structural components (e.g., textures in images or transients in sounds). Furthermore, existing methods are usually tailored to a single data modality, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we propose leveraging the wavelet domain as a robust mathematical foundation for attribution. Our approach, the Wavelet Attribution Method (WAM) extends the existing gradient-based feature attributions into the wavelet domain, providing a unified framework for explaining classifiers across images, audio, and 3D shapes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that WAM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across faithfulness metrics and models in image, audio, and 3D explainability. Finally, we show how our method explains not only the where -- the important parts of the input -- but also the what -- the relevant patterns in terms of structural components.</description>

      <title>DLP-LoRA: Efficient Task-Specific LoRA Fusion with a Dynamic, Lightweight Plugin for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved robust performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning these models for specific domains remains resource-intensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) address this challenge by fine-tuning a small subset of parameters. However, existing methods for fusing multiple LoRAs lack dynamic fusion based on contextual inputs and often increase inference time due to token-level operations. We propose DLP-LoRA, a Dynamic Lightweight Plugin that employs a mini-MLP module with only 5M parameters to dynamically fuse multiple LoRAs at the sentence level using top-p sampling strategies. This approach reduces inference time to less than twice that of single LoRA inference by leveraging parallel computation. Evaluations across 26 tasks-including multiple-choice questions and question answering-demonstrate that DLP-LoRA achieves an average accuracy of 92.34% on multiple-choice datasets and significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores on QA datasets, outperforming different LLMs backbones under composite task settings. DLP-LoRA effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it a practical solution for dynamic multi-task adaptation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MeCuping/DLP-LoRA.</description>

      <title>LEGO: Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains, and modalities, such as text, images, and videos. Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing similarity graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we use graph power expansions and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to combine these graph powers for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise similarity score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks.</description>

      <title>Attention layers provably solve single-location regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based models, such as Transformer, excel across various tasks but lack a comprehensive theoretical understanding, especially regarding token-wise sparsity and internal linear representations. To address this gap, we introduce the single-location regression task, where only one token in a sequence determines the output, and its position is a latent random variable, retrievable via a linear projection of the input. To solve this task, we propose a dedicated predictor, which turns out to be a simplified version of a non-linear self-attention layer. We study its theoretical properties, by showing its asymptotic Bayes optimality and analyzing its training dynamics. In particular, despite the non-convex nature of the problem, the predictor effectively learns the underlying structure. This work highlights the capacity of attention mechanisms to handle sparse token information and internal linear structures.</description>

      <title>Edge-preserving noise for diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that is a generalization of denoising diffusion probablistic models (DDPM). In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing consistent improvements (FID score) of up to 30% for both tasks.</description>

      <title>Integrative Decoding: Improve Factuality via Implicit Self-consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency-based approaches, which involve repeatedly sampling multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one as the final response, prove to be remarkably effective in improving the factual accuracy of large language models. Nonetheless, existing methods usually have strict constraints on the task format, largely limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present Integrative Decoding (ID), to unlock the potential of self-consistency in open-ended generation tasks. ID operates by constructing a set of inputs, each prepended with a previously sampled response, and then processes them concurrently, with the next token being selected by aggregating of all their corresponding predictions at each decoding step. In essence, this simple approach implicitly incorporates self-consistency in the decoding objective. Extensive evaluation shows that ID consistently enhances factuality over a wide range of language models, with substantial improvements on the TruthfulQA (+11.2%), Biographies (+15.4%) and LongFact (+8.5%) benchmarks. The performance gains amplify progressively as the number of sampled responses increases, indicating the potential of ID to scale up with repeated sampling.</description>

      <title>OpenMathInstruct-2: Accelerating AI for Math with Massive Open-Source Instruction Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical reasoning continues to be a critical challenge in large language model (LLM) development with significant interest. However, most of the cutting-edge progress in mathematical reasoning with LLMs has become \emph{closed-source} due to lack of access to training data. This lack of data access limits researchers from understanding the impact of different choices for synthesizing and utilizing the data. With the goal of creating a high-quality finetuning (SFT) dataset for math reasoning, we conduct careful ablation experiments on data synthesis using the recently released \texttt{Llama3.1} family of models. Our experiments show that: (a) solution format matters, with excessively verbose solutions proving detrimental to SFT performance, (b) data generated by a strong teacher outperforms \emph{on-policy} data generated by a weak student model, (c) SFT is robust to low-quality solutions, allowing for imprecise data filtering, and (d) question diversity is crucial for achieving data scaling gains. Based on these insights, we create the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset, which consists of 14M question-solution pairs ($\approx$ 600K unique questions), making it nearly eight times larger than the previous largest open-source math reasoning dataset. Finetuning the \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Base} using OpenMathInstruct-2 outperforms \texttt{Llama3.1-8B-Instruct} on MATH by an absolute 15.9\% (51.9\% $\rightarrow$ 67.8\%). Finally, to accelerate the open-source efforts, we release the code, the finetuned models, and the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset under a commercially permissive license.</description>

      <title>HRTF Estimation using a Score-based Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a head-related transfer function (HRTF) estimation method which relies on a data-driven prior given by a score-based diffusion model. The HRTF is estimated in reverberant environments using natural excitation signals, e.g. human speech. The impulse response of the room is estimated along with the HRTF by optimizing a parametric model of reverberation based on the statistical behaviour of room acoustics. The posterior distribution of HRTF given the reverberant measurement and excitation signal is modelled using the score-based HRTF prior and a log-likelihood approximation. We show that the resulting method outperforms several baselines, including an oracle recommender system that assigns the optimal HRTF in our training set based on the smallest distance to the true HRTF at the given direction of arrival. In particular, we show that the diffusion prior can account for the large variability of high-frequency content in HRTFs.</description>

      <title>Fake It Until You Break It: On the Adversarial Robustness of AI-generated Image Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While generative AI (GenAI) offers countless possibilities for creative and productive tasks, artificially generated media can be misused for fraud, manipulation, scams, misinformation campaigns, and more. To mitigate the risks associated with maliciously generated media, forensic classifiers are employed to identify AI-generated content. However, current forensic classifiers are often not evaluated in practically relevant scenarios, such as the presence of an attacker or when real-world artifacts like social media degradations affect images. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors under different attack scenarios. We demonstrate that forensic classifiers can be effectively attacked in realistic settings, even when the attacker does not have access to the target model and post-processing occurs after the adversarial examples are created, which is standard on social media platforms. These attacks can significantly reduce detection accuracy to the extent that the risks of relying on detectors outweigh their benefits. Finally, we propose a simple defense mechanism to make CLIP-based detectors, which are currently the best-performing detectors, robust against these attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) offers tissue-specific physical parameters with significant potential for neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, lengthy scan times for 3D multiparametric qMRI acquisition limit its clinical utility. Here, we propose SUMMIT, an innovative imaging methodology that includes data acquisition and an unsupervised reconstruction for simultaneous multiparametric qMRI. SUMMIT first encodes multiple important quantitative properties into highly undersampled k-space. It further leverages implicit neural representation incorporated with a dedicated physics model to reconstruct the desired multiparametric maps without needing external training datasets. SUMMIT delivers co-registered T1, T2, T2*, and quantitative susceptibility mapping. Extensive simulations and phantom imaging demonstrate SUMMIT's high accuracy. Additionally, the proposed unsupervised approach for qMRI reconstruction also introduces a novel zero-shot learning paradigm for multiparametric imaging applicable to various medical imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>SAFE: Semantic Adaptive Feature Extraction with Rate Control for 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most current Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication (DeepSC) systems are designed and trained exclusively for particular single-channel conditions, which restricts their adaptability and overall bandwidth utilization. To address this, we propose an innovative Semantic Adaptive Feature Extraction (SAFE) framework, which significantly improves bandwidth efficiency by allowing users to select different sub-semantic combinations based on their channel conditions. This paper also introduces three advanced learning algorithms to optimize the performance of SAFE framework as a whole. Through a series of simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the SAFE framework can effectively and adaptively extract and transmit semantics under different channel bandwidth conditions, of which effectiveness is verified through objective and subjective quality evaluations.</description>

      <title>Towards Model Discovery Using Domain Decomposition and PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We enhance machine learning algorithms for learning model parameters in complex systems represented by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with domain decomposition methods. The study evaluates the performance of two approaches, namely (vanilla) Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs), in learning the dynamics of test models with a quasi-stationary longtime behavior. We test the approaches for data sets in different dynamical regions and with varying noise level. As results, we find a better performance for the FBPINN approach compared to the vanilla PINN approach, even in cases with data from only a quasi-stationary time domain with few dynamics.</description>

      <title>DRUPI: Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset reduction (DR) seeks to select or distill samples from large datasets into smaller subsets while preserving performance on target tasks. Existing methods primarily focus on pruning or synthesizing data in the same format as the original dataset, typically the input data and corresponding labels. However, in DR settings, we find it is possible to synthesize more information beyond the data-label pair as an additional learning target to facilitate model training. In this paper, we introduce Dataset Reduction Using Privileged Information (DRUPI), which enriches DR by synthesizing privileged information alongside the reduced dataset. This privileged information can take the form of feature labels or attention labels, providing auxiliary supervision to improve model learning. Our findings reveal that effective feature labels must balance between being overly discriminative and excessively diverse, with a moderate level proving optimal for improving the reduced dataset's efficacy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that DRUPI integrates seamlessly with existing dataset reduction methods, offering significant performance gains.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework of Horizontal-Vertical Hybrid Federated Learning for EdgeIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter puts forth a new hybrid horizontal-vertical federated learning (HoVeFL) for mobile edge computing-enabled Internet of Things (EdgeIoT). In this framework, certain EdgeIoT devices train local models using the same data samples but analyze disparate data features, while the others focus on the same features using non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data samples. Thus, even though the data features are consistent, the data samples vary across devices. The proposed HoVeFL formulates the training of local and global models to minimize the global loss function. Performance evaluations on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets reveal that the testing loss of HoVeFL with 12 horizontal FL devices and six vertical FL devices is 5.5% and 25.2% higher, respectively, compared to a setup with six horizontal FL devices and 12 vertical FL devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Statistics With Unknown Truncation, Polynomial Time Algorithms, Beyond Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of distributional parameters when samples are shown only if they fall in some unknown set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. Kontonis, Tzamos, and Zampetakis (FOCS'19) gave a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-accurate parameters for the special case of Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrix. Recently, Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas, and Zarifis (COLT'24) showed that this exponential dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ is necessary even when $S$ belongs to some well-behaved classes. These works leave the following open problems which we address in this work: Can we estimate the parameters of any Gaussian or even extend beyond Gaussians? Can we design $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ time algorithms when $S$ is a simple set such as a halfspace?
  We make progress on both of these questions by providing the following results:
  1. Toward the first question, we give a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(\ell/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for any exponential family that satisfies some structural assumptions and any unknown set $S$ that is $\varepsilon$-approximable by degree-$\ell$ polynomials. This result has two important applications:
  1a) The first algorithm for estimating arbitrary Gaussian distributions from samples truncated to an unknown $S$; and
  1b) The first algorithm for linear regression with unknown truncation and Gaussian features.
  2. To address the second question, we provide an algorithm with runtime $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ that works for a set of exponential families (containing all Gaussians) when $S$ is a halfspace or an axis-aligned rectangle.
  Along the way, we develop tools that may be of independent interest, including, a reduction from PAC learning with positive and unlabeled samples to PAC learning with positive and negative samples that is robust to certain covariate shifts.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Consistent Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Mesh-based Data-driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a distributed graph neural network (GNN) methodology for mesh-based modeling applications using a consistent neural message passing layer. As the name implies, the focus is on enabling scalable operations that satisfy physical consistency via halo nodes at sub-graph boundaries. Here, consistency refers to the fact that a GNN trained and evaluated on one rank (one large graph) is arithmetically equivalent to evaluations on multiple ranks (a partitioned graph). This concept is demonstrated by interfacing GNNs with NekRS, a GPU-capable exascale CFD solver developed at Argonne National Laboratory. It is shown how the NekRS mesh partitioning can be linked to the distributed GNN training and inference routines, resulting in a scalable mesh-based data-driven modeling workflow. We study the impact of consistency on the scalability of mesh-based GNNs, demonstrating efficient scaling in consistent GNNs for up to O(1B) graph nodes on the Frontier exascale supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Smaller Confidence Intervals From IPW Estimators via Data-Dependent Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse propensity-score weighted (IPW) estimators are prevalent in causal inference for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies. Under unconfoundedness, given accurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, the size of confidence intervals of IPW estimators scales down with $n$, and, several of their variants improve the rate of scaling. However, neither IPW estimators nor their variants are robust to inaccuracies: even if a single covariate has an $\varepsilon&gt;0$ additive error in the propensity score, the size of confidence intervals of these estimators can increase arbitrarily. Moreover, even without errors, the rate with which the confidence intervals of these estimators go to zero with $n$ can be arbitrarily slow in the presence of extreme propensity scores (those close to 0 or 1).
  We introduce a family of Coarse IPW (CIPW) estimators that captures existing IPW estimators and their variants. Each CIPW estimator is an IPW estimator on a coarsened covariate space, where certain covariates are merged. Under mild assumptions, e.g., Lipschitzness in expected outcomes and sparsity of extreme propensity scores, we give an efficient algorithm to find a robust estimator: given $\varepsilon$-inaccurate propensity scores and $n$ samples, its confidence interval size scales with $\varepsilon+1/\sqrt{n}$. In contrast, under the same assumptions, existing estimators' confidence interval sizes are $\Omega(1)$ irrespective of $\varepsilon$ and $n$. Crucially, our estimator is data-dependent and we show that no data-independent CIPW estimator can be robust to inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Synthetic Data in LLM Post-Training: A Reverse-Bottleneck Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has become a pivotal resource in post-training tasks for large language models (LLMs) due to the scarcity of high-quality, specific data. While various methods have been developed to generate synthetic data, there remains a discernible gap between the practical effects of synthetic data and our theoretical comprehension. To address this challenge, we commence by presenting a detailed modeling of the prevalent synthetic data generation process. Building upon this modeling, we demonstrate that the generalization capability of the post-trained model is critically determined by the information gain derived from the generative model, as analyzed from a novel reverse-bottleneck perspective. Moreover, we introduce the concept of Generalization Gain via Mutual Information (GGMI) and elucidate the relationship between generalization gain and information gain. This analysis serves as a theoretical foundation for synthetic data generation and further highlights its connection with the generalization capability of post-trained models, offering an understanding about the design of synthetic data generation techniques and the optimization of the post-training process. We open source our code through an anonymous GitHub repository at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Understanding-Synthetic.</description>

      <title>LASeR: Learning to Adaptively Select Reward Models with Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) play a crucial role in aligning LLMs with human preferences, enhancing their performance by ranking outputs during inference or iterative training. However, the degree to which an RM generalizes to new tasks is often not known a priori (e.g. some RMs may excel at scoring creative writing vs. math reasoning). Therefore, using only one fixed RM while training LLMs can be suboptimal. Moreover, optimizing LLMs with multiple RMs simultaneously can be prohibitively computationally-intensive and challenging due to conflicting signals from different RMs, potentially degrading performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LASeR (Learning to Adaptively Select Rewards), which iteratively trains LLMs using multiple RMs, selecting and utilizing the most well-suited RM for each instance to rank outputs and generate preference data, framed as a multi-armed bandit problem. Our results on commonsense and math reasoning tasks demonstrate that LASeR can boost iterative LLM optimization by optimizing for multiple RMs, improving the absolute average accuracy of Llama-3-8B over three datasets by 2.67% over training with ensemble RM scores while also showing superior training efficiency (e.g., a 2x speedup). Moreover, on WildChat, a benchmark of instruction-following prompts, we find that using Llama-3-8B LASeR leads to a 71.45% AlpacaEval win rate over sequentially optimizing multiple RMs. Extending to long-context generation tasks, we find that on Llama-3-8B, LASeR achieves an average improvement of 2.64 F1 and 2.42 F1 on single- and multi-document QA over random RM selection when used with best-of-n sampling. LASeR is robust to noisy rewards and generalizes to multiple settings. Finally, LASeR's RM selection changes depending on the underlying task or instance and we verify the presence of conflicting preferences from multiple RMs that can be mitigated using LASeR.</description>

      <title>Recursive Abstractive Processing for Retrieval in Dynamic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented models enhance basic methods by building a hierarchical structure over retrieved text chunks through recursive embedding, clustering, and summarization. The most relevant information is then retrieved from both the original text and generated summaries. However, such approaches face limitations with dynamic datasets, where adding or removing documents over time complicates the updating of hierarchical representations formed through clustering. We propose a new algorithm to efficiently maintain the recursive-abstractive tree structure in dynamic datasets, without compromising performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel post-retrieval method that applies query-focused recursive abstractive processing to substantially improve context quality. Our method overcomes the limitations of other approaches by functioning as a black-box post-retrieval layer compatible with any retrieval algorithm. Both algorithms are validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in handling dynamic data and improving retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Human Intuition: Cognitive Belief-Driven Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning encounters challenges in various environments related to robustness and explainability. Traditional Q-learning algorithms cannot effectively make decisions and utilize the historical learning experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cognitive Belief-Driven Q-Learning (CBDQ), which integrates subjective belief modeling into the Q-learning framework, enhancing decision-making accuracy by endowing agents with human-like learning and reasoning capabilities. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, our method maintains a subjective belief distribution over the expectation of actions, leveraging a cluster-based subjective belief model that enables agents to reason about the potential probability associated with each decision. CBDQ effectively mitigates overestimated phenomena and optimizes decision-making policies by integrating historical experiences with current contextual information, mimicking the dynamics of human decision-making. We evaluate the proposed method on discrete control benchmark tasks in various complicate environments. The results demonstrate that CBDQ exhibits stronger adaptability, robustness, and human-like characteristics in handling these environments, outperforming other baselines. We hope this work will give researchers a fresh perspective on understanding and explaining Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Integrating Protein Sequence and Expression Level to Analysis Molecular Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer's complexity and variability pose significant challenges in understanding its progression and guiding effective treatment. This study aims to integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model designed for protein sequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structural properties of proteins sequence. These embeddings were integrated with protein expression level to form enriched biological representations, which were analyzed using machine learning methods like ensemble K-means for clustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled successful clustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarkers status, achieving high performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 for biomarkers status prediction. Analysis of feature importance highlighted key proteins like KMT2C, GCN1, and CLASP2, linked to hormone receptor and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) expression, which play a role in tumor progression and patient outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and correlation analyses revealed the interdependence of proteins that may influence breast cancer subtype behaviors. These findings suggest that integrating protein sequence and expression data provides valuable insights into tumor biology and has significant potential to enhance personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.</description>

      <title>SegHeD: Segmentation of Heterogeneous Data for Multiple Sclerosis Lesions with Anatomical Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessment of lesions and their longitudinal progression from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring multiple sclerosis (MS). Machine learning models have demonstrated a great potential for automated MS lesion segmentation. Training such models typically requires large-scale high-quality datasets that are consistently annotated. However, MS imaging datasets are often small, segregated across multiple sites, with different formats (cross-sectional or longitudinal), and diverse annotation styles. This poses a significant challenge to train a unified MS lesion segmentation model. To tackle this challenge, we present SegHeD, a novel multi-dataset multi-task segmentation model that can incorporate heterogeneous data as input and perform all-lesion, new-lesion, as well as vanishing-lesion segmentation. Furthermore, we account for domain knowledge about MS lesions, incorporating longitudinal, spatial, and volumetric constraints into the segmentation model. SegHeD is assessed on five MS datasets and achieves a high performance in all, new, and vanishing-lesion segmentation, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in this field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical-generative downscaling of climate model ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regional high-resolution climate projections are crucial for many applications, such as agriculture, hydrology, and natural hazard risk assessment. Dynamical downscaling, the state-of-the-art method to produce localized future climate information, involves running a regional climate model (RCM) driven by an Earth System Model (ESM), but it is too computationally expensive to apply to large climate projection ensembles. We propose a novel approach combining dynamical downscaling with generative artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and improve the uncertainty estimates of downscaled climate projections. In our framework, an RCM dynamically downscales ESM output to an intermediate resolution, followed by a generative diffusion model that further refines the resolution to the target scale. This approach leverages the generalizability of physics-based models and the sampling efficiency of diffusion models, enabling the downscaling of large multi-model ensembles. We evaluate our method against dynamically-downscaled climate projections from the CMIP6 ensemble. Our results demonstrate its ability to provide more accurate uncertainty bounds on future regional climate than alternatives such as dynamical downscaling of smaller ensembles, or traditional empirical statistical downscaling methods. We also show that dynamical-generative downscaling results in significantly lower errors than bias correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD), and captures more accurately the spectra and multivariate correlations of meteorological fields. These characteristics make the dynamical-generative framework a flexible, accurate, and efficient way to downscale large ensembles of climate projections, currently out of reach for pure dynamical downscaling.</description>

      <title>Open-RAG: Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning with Open-Source Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been shown to enhance the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs), but existing methods often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities in effectively using the retrieved evidence, particularly when using open-source LLMs. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a novel framework, Open-RAG, designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in RAG with open-source LLMs. Our framework transforms an arbitrary dense LLM into a parameter-efficient sparse mixture of experts (MoE) model capable of handling complex reasoning tasks, including both single- and multi-hop queries. Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. As a result, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In addition, we propose a hybrid adaptive retrieval method to determine retrieval necessity and balance the trade-off between performance gain and inference speed. Experimental results show that the Llama2-7B-based Open-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and RAG models such as ChatGPT, Self-RAG, and Command R+ in various knowledge-intensive tasks. We open-source our code and models at https://openragmoe.github.io/</description>

Abstract: A fully Bayesian treatment of complicated predictive models (such as deep neural networks) would enable rigorous uncertainty quantification and the automation of higher-level tasks including model selection. However, the intractability of sampling Bayesian posteriors over many parameters inhibits the use of Bayesian methods where they are most needed. Thermodynamic computing has emerged as a paradigm for accelerating operations used in machine learning, such as matrix inversion, and is based on the mapping of Langevin equations to the dynamics of noisy physical systems. Hence, it is natural to consider the implementation of Langevin sampling algorithms on thermodynamic devices. In this work we propose electronic analog devices that sample from Bayesian posteriors by realizing Langevin dynamics physically. Circuit designs are given for sampling the posterior of a Gaussian-Gaussian model and for Bayesian logistic regression, and are validated by simulations. It is shown, under reasonable assumptions, that the Bayesian posteriors for these models can be sampled in time scaling with $\ln(d)$, where $d$ is dimension. For the Gaussian-Gaussian model, the energy cost is shown to scale with $ d \ln(d)$. These results highlight the potential for fast, energy-efficient Bayesian inference using thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient $1$-bit tensor approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spatially efficient decomposition of matrices and arbitrary-order tensors as linear combinations of tensor products of $\{-1, 1\}$-valued vectors. For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, $$A - R_w = S_w C_w T_w^\top = \sum_{j=1}^w c_j \cdot \mathbf{s}_j \mathbf{t}_j^\top$$ is a {\it $w$-width signed cut decomposition of $A$}. Here $C_w = "diag"(\mathbf{c}_w)$ for some $\mathbf{c}_w \in \mathbb{R}^w,$ and $S_w, T_w$, and the vectors $\mathbf{s}_j, \mathbf{t}_j$ are $\{-1, 1\}$-valued. To store $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$, we may pack $w \cdot (m + n)$ bits, and require only $w$ floating point numbers. As a function of $w$, $\|R_w\|_F$ exhibits exponential decay when applied to #f32 matrices with i.i.d. $\mathcal N (0, 1)$ entries. Choosing $w$ so that $(S_w, T_w, C_w)$ has the same memory footprint as a \textit{f16} or \textit{bf16} matrix, the relative error is comparable. Our algorithm yields efficient signed cut decompositions in $20$ lines of pseudocode. It reflects a simple modification from a celebrated 1999 paper [1] of Frieze and Kannan. As a first application, we approximate the weight matrices in the open \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} Large Language Model to a $50\%$ spatial compression. Remarkably, all $226$ remainder matrices have a relative error $&lt;6\%$ and the expanded model closely matches \textit{Mistral-7B-v0.1} on the {\it huggingface} leaderboard [2]. Benchmark performance degrades slowly as we reduce the spatial compression from $50\%$ to $25\%$. We optimize our open source \textit{rust} implementation [3] with \textit{simd} instructions on \textit{avx2} and \textit{avx512} architectures. We also extend our algorithm from matrices to tensors of arbitrary order and use it to compress a picture of the first author's cat Angus.</description>

      <title>Towards Futuristic Autonomous Experimentation--A Surprise-Reacting Sequential Experiment Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An autonomous experimentation platform in manufacturing is supposedly capable of conducting a sequential search for finding suitable manufacturing conditions by itself or even for discovering new materials with minimal human intervention. The core of the intelligent control of such platforms is a policy to decide where to conduct the next experiment based on what has been done thus far. Such policy inevitably trades off between exploitation and exploration. Currently, the prevailing approach is to use various acquisition functions in the Bayesian optimization framework. We discuss whether it is beneficial to trade off exploitation versus exploration by measuring the element and degree of surprise associated with the immediate past observation. We devise a surprise-reacting policy using two existing surprise metrics, known as the Shannon surprise and Bayesian surprise. Our analysis shows that the surprise-reacting policy appears to be better suited for quickly characterizing the overall landscape of a response surface under resource constraints. We do not claim that we have a fully autonomous experimentation system but believe that the surprise-reacting capability benefits the automation of sequential decisions in autonomous experimentation.</description>

Abstract: Most reinforcement learning practitioners evaluate their policies with online Monte Carlo estimators for either hyperparameter tuning or testing different algorithmic design choices, where the policy is repeatedly executed in the environment to get the average outcome. Such massive interactions with the environment are prohibitive in many scenarios. In this paper, we propose novel methods that improve the data efficiency of online Monte Carlo estimators while maintaining their unbiasedness. We first propose a tailored closed-form behavior policy that provably reduces the variance of an online Monte Carlo estimator. We then design efficient algorithms to learn this closed-form behavior policy from previously collected offline data. Theoretical analysis is provided to characterize how the behavior policy learning error affects the amount of reduced variance. Compared with previous works, our method achieves better empirical performance in a broader set of environments, with fewer requirements for offline data.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Graph Representation Learning via Edge Temporal States Modeling and Structure-reinforced Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has emerged as a crucial research area, driven by the growing need for analyzing time-evolving graph data in real-world applications. While recent approaches leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture the impact of temporal edge states on inter-node relationships, consequently overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by these evolving relationships. Furthermore, these methods suffer from GNNs' inherent over-smoothing problem, which hinders the extraction of global structural features. To address these challenges, we introduce the Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), a novel framework for dynamic graph representation learning. It first designs a heuristic method to explicitly model edge temporal states by employing different edge types and weights based on the differences between consecutive snapshots, thereby integrating varying edge temporal states into the graph's topological structure. We then propose a structure-reinforced graph transformer that captures temporal node representations encoding both graph topology and evolving dynamics through a recurrent learning paradigm, enabling the extraction of both local and global structural features. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate RSGT's superior performance in discrete dynamic graph representation learning, consistently outperforming existing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Transferability Bound Theory: Exploring Relationship between Adversarial Transferability and Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prevailing belief in attack and defense community is that the higher flatness of adversarial examples enables their better cross-model transferability, leading to a growing interest in employing sharpness-aware minimization and its variants. However, the theoretical relationship between the transferability of adversarial examples and their flatness has not been well established, making the belief questionable. To bridge this gap, we embark on a theoretical investigation and, for the first time, derive a theoretical bound for the transferability of adversarial examples with few practical assumptions. Our analysis challenges this belief by demonstrating that the increased flatness of adversarial examples does not necessarily guarantee improved transferability. Moreover, building upon the theoretical analysis, we propose TPA, a Theoretically Provable Attack that optimizes a surrogate of the derived bound to craft adversarial examples. Extensive experiments across widely used benchmark datasets and various real-world applications show that TPA can craft more transferable adversarial examples compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We hope that these results can recalibrate preconceived impressions within the community and facilitate the development of stronger adversarial attack and defense mechanisms.

      <title>Open-Set Graph Anomaly Detection via Normal Structure Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06835v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an important Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to train a detection model using a small number of normal and anomaly nodes (referred to as seen anomalies) to detect both seen anomalies and unseen anomalies (i.e., anomalies that cannot be illustrated the training anomalies). Those labelled training data provide crucial prior knowledge about abnormalities for GAD models, enabling substantially reduced detection errors. However, current supervised GAD methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to many errors of detecting the unseen anomalies as normal nodes. Further, existing open-set AD models were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture discriminative features from graph structure and node attributes for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to achieve generalised detection ability to unseen anomalies, while maintaining its effectiveness on detecting seen anomalies. The key idea in NSReg is to introduce a regularisation term that enforces the learning of compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes based on their structural relations to other nodes. When being optimised with supervised anomaly detection losses, the regularisation term helps incorporate strong normality into the modelling, and thus, it effectively avoids over-fitting the seen anomalies and learns a better normality decision boundary, largely reducing the false negatives of detecting unseen anomalies as normal. Extensive empirical results on seven real-world datasets show that NSReg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 14% AUC-ROC on the unseen anomaly classes and by 10% AUC-ROC on all anomaly classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first mini-batch algorithm for maximizing a non-negative monotone decomposable submodular function, $F=\sum_{i=1}^N f^i$, under a set of constraints. We consider two sampling approaches: uniform and weighted. We first show that mini-batch with weighted sampling improves over the state of the art sparsifier based approach both in theory and in practice.
  Surprisingly, our experimental results show that uniform sampling is superior to weighted sampling. However, it is impossible to explain this using worst-case analysis. Our main contribution is using smoothed analysis to provide a theoretical foundation for our experimental results. We show that, under very mild assumptions, uniform sampling is superior for both the mini-batch and the sparsifier approaches. We empirically verify that these assumptions hold for our datasets. Uniform sampling is simple to implement and has complexity independent of $N$, making it the perfect candidate to tackle massive real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Graph Algorithms with Looped Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The execution of graph algorithms using neural networks has recently attracted significant interest due to promising empirical progress. This motivates further understanding of how neural networks can replicate reasoning steps with relational data. In this work, we study the ability of transformer networks to simulate algorithms on graphs from a theoretical perspective. The architecture we use is a looped transformer with extra attention heads that interact with the graph. We prove by construction that this architecture can simulate individual algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path, Breadth- and Depth-First Search, and Kosaraju's strongly connected components, as well as multiple algorithms simultaneously. The number of parameters in the networks does not increase with the input graph size, which implies that the networks can simulate the above algorithms for any graph. Despite this property, we show a limit to simulation in our solution due to finite precision. Finally, we show a Turing Completeness result with constant width when the extra attention heads are utilized.</description>

      <title>$\sigma$-zero: Gradient-based Optimization of $\ell_0$-norm Adversarial Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating the adversarial robustness of deep networks to gradient-based attacks is challenging. While most attacks consider $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm constraints to craft input perturbations, only a few investigate sparse $\ell_1$- and $\ell_0$-norm attacks. In particular, $\ell_0$-norm attacks remain the least studied due to the inherent complexity of optimizing over a non-convex and non-differentiable constraint. However, evaluating adversarial robustness under these attacks could reveal weaknesses otherwise left untested with more conventional $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm attacks. In this work, we propose a novel $\ell_0$-norm attack, called $\sigma$-zero, which leverages a differentiable approximation of the $\ell_0$ norm to facilitate gradient-based optimization, and an adaptive projection operator to dynamically adjust the trade-off between loss minimization and perturbation sparsity. Extensive evaluations using MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets, involving robust and non-robust models, show that $\sigma$-zero finds minimum $\ell_0$-norm adversarial examples without requiring any time-consuming hyperparameter tuning, and that it outperforms all competing sparse attacks in terms of success rate, perturbation size, and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel graph transformer framework, HAMLET, designed to address the challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks. The framework uses graph transformers with modular input encoders to directly incorporate differential equation information into the solution process. This modularity enhances parameter correspondence control, making HAMLET adaptable to PDEs of arbitrary geometries and varied input formats. Notably, HAMLET scales effectively with increasing data complexity and noise, showcasing its robustness. HAMLET is not just tailored to a single type of physical simulation, but can be applied across various domains. Moreover, it boosts model resilience and performance, especially in scenarios with limited data. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that our framework is capable of outperforming current techniques for PDEs.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Message Passing for Learning on Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05569v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are crucial for modelling higher-order interactions in real-world data. Hypergraph neural networks (HNNs) effectively utilise these structures by message passing to generate informative node features for various downstream tasks like node classification. However, the message passing module in existing HNNs typically requires a computationally intensive training process, which limits their practical use. To tackle this challenge, we propose an alternative approach by decoupling the usage of hypergraph structural information from the model learning stage. This leads to a novel training-free message passing module, named TF-MP-Module, which can be precomputed in the data preprocessing stage, thereby reducing the computational burden. We refer to the hypergraph neural network equipped with our TF-MP-Module as TF-HNN. We theoretically support the efficiency and effectiveness of TF-HNN by showing that: 1) It is more training-efficient compared to existing HNNs; 2) It utilises as much information as existing HNNs for node feature generation; and 3) It is robust against the oversmoothing issue while using long-range interactions. Experiments based on seven real-world hypergraph benchmarks in node classification and hyperlink prediction show that, compared to state-of-the-art HNNs, TF-HNN exhibits both competitive performance and superior training efficiency. Specifically, on the large-scale benchmark, Trivago, TF-HNN outperforms the node classification accuracy of the best baseline by 10% with just 1% of the training time of that baseline.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Context through Multi-Round Interactions for Jailbreaking Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query. As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired from Chomsky's transformational-generative grammar theory and human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form, called Contextual Interaction Attack. We contend that the prior context\u2014the information preceding the attack query\u2014plays a pivotal role in enabling strong Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose a first multi-turn approach that leverages benign preliminary questions to interact with the LLM. Due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which use previous conversation rounds as context during generation, we guide the model's question-response pair to construct a context that is semantically aligned with the attack query to execute the attack. We conduct experiments on seven different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of security in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Broadening Target Distributions for Accelerated Diffusion Models via a Novel Analysis Approach</title>

Abstract: Accelerated diffusion models hold the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of standard diffusion processes. Theoretically, these models have been shown to achieve faster convergence rates than the standard $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rate of vanilla diffusion models, where $\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy. However, current theoretical studies have established the acceleration advantage only for restrictive target distribution classes, such as those with smoothness conditions imposed along the entire sampling path or with bounded support. In this work, we significantly broaden the target distribution classes with a novel accelerated stochastic DDPM sampler. In particular, we show that it achieves accelerated performance for three broad distribution classes not considered before. Our first class relies on the smoothness condition posed only to the target density $q_0$, which is far more relaxed than the existing smoothness conditions posed to all $q_t$ along the entire sampling path. Our second class requires only a finite second moment condition, allowing for a much wider class of target distributions than the existing finite-support condition. Our third class is Gaussian mixture, for which our result establishes the first acceleration guarantee. Moreover, among accelerated DDPM type samplers, our results specialized for bounded-support distributions show an improved dependency on the data dimension $d$. Our analysis introduces a novel technique for establishing performance guarantees via constructing a tilting factor representation of the convergence error and utilizing Tweedie's formula to handle Taylor expansion terms. This new analytical framework may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid social progress, novel neural networks with high generalization power and robustness are strongly required to substitute traditional ones nowadays. Concurrently, the advent of the post-Moore era has spurred the development of quantum-inspired algorithms with outstanding potentials. Hence, influenced by quantum-inspired and pure classical neural networks, we propose two hybrid quantum-inspired neural networks which are rooted in residual and dense connections respectively for pattern recognition. We explain the concrete frameworks and illustrate the potential superiority to prevent gradient explosion of our hybrid models. Numerical experiments indicate that the recognition accuracy of our hybrid models is 2\%-3\% higher than that of the traditional quantum-inspired model. Our hybrid models also generalize as well as the pure classical models with different noisy datasets utilized. More importantly, our hybrid models outperform pure classical models notably in robustness, especially in resistance to parameter attacks with various asymmetric noises. Eventually, we discuss the application scenarios of our hybrid models by analyzing their computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zero-Shot Scalable Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is significantly transforming various fields like autonomous vehicle networks. However, real-world multi-agent systems typically contain multiple roles, and the scale of these systems dynamically fluctuates. Consequently, in order to achieve zero-shot scalable collaboration, it is essential that strategies for different roles can be updated flexibly according to the scales, which is still a challenge for current MARL frameworks. To address this, we propose a novel MARL framework named Scalable and Heterogeneous Proximal Policy Optimization (SHPPO), integrating heterogeneity into parameter-shared PPO-based MARL networks. We first leverage a latent network to learn strategy patterns for each agent adaptively. Second, we introduce a heterogeneous layer to be inserted into decision-making networks, whose parameters are specifically generated by the learned latent variables. Our approach is scalable as all the parameters are shared except for the heterogeneous layer, and gains both inter-individual and temporal heterogeneity, allowing SHPPO to adapt effectively to varying scales. SHPPO exhibits superior performance in classic MARL environments like Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) and Google Research Football (GRF), showcasing enhanced zero-shot scalability, and offering insights into the learned latent variables' impact on team performance by visualization.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for source-dependent 3D elastodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential tools to evaluate the solution of the wave equation in complex settings, such as three-dimensional (3D) domains with heterogeneous properties. However, their application is limited by high computational costs and existing surrogate models lack the flexibility of numerical solvers. This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.</description>

      <title>Approximate Nearest Neighbour Search on Dynamic Datasets: An Investigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate k-Nearest Neighbour (ANN) methods are often used for mining information and aiding machine learning on large scale high-dimensional datasets. ANN methods typically differ in the index structure used for accelerating searches, resulting in various recall/runtime trade-off points. For applications with static datasets, runtime constraints and dataset properties can be used to empirically select an ANN method with suitable operating characteristics. However, for applications with dynamic datasets, which are subject to frequent online changes (like addition of new samples), there is currently no consensus as to which ANN methods are most suitable. Traditional evaluation approaches do not consider the computational costs of updating the index structure, as well as the rate and size of index updates. To address this, we empirically evaluate 5 popular ANN methods on two main applications (online data collection and online feature learning) while taking into account these considerations. Two dynamic datasets are used, derived from the SIFT1M dataset with 1 million samples and the DEEP1B dataset with 1 billion samples. The results indicate that the often used k-d trees method is not suitable on dynamic datasets as it is slower than a straightforward baseline exhaustive search method. For online data collection, the Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs method achieves a consistent speedup over baseline across a wide range of recall rates. For online feature learning, the Scalable Nearest Neighbours method is faster than baseline for recall rates below 75%.</description>

      <title>Neural Context Flows for Meta-Learning of Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) often struggle to adapt to new dynamic behaviors caused by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when these dynamics are similar to previously observed behaviors. This problem becomes more challenging when the changing parameters are unobserved, meaning their value or influence cannot be directly measured when collecting data. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a robust and interpretable Meta-Learning framework that includes uncertainty estimation. NCF uses higher-order Taylor expansion to enable contextual self-modulation, allowing context vectors to influence dynamics from other domains while also modulating themselves. After establishing convergence guarantees, we empirically test NCF and compare it to related adaptation methods. Our results show that NCF achieves state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution performance on 5 out of 6 linear and non-linear benchmark problems. Through extensive experiments, we explore the flexible model architecture of NCF and the encoded representations within the learned context vectors. Our findings highlight the potential implications of NCF for foundational models in the physical sciences, offering a promising approach to improving the adaptability and generalization of NODEs in various scientific applications.

      <title>Outlier Gradient Analysis: Efficiently Identifying Detrimental Training Samples for Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>Observational Scaling Laws and the Predictability of Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~100 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve.</description>

      <title>Ensemble and Mixture-of-Experts DeepONets For Operator Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture for operator learning, the ensemble DeepONet, that allows for enriching the trunk network of a single DeepONet with multiple distinct trunk networks. This trunk enrichment allows for greater expressivity and generalization capabilities over a range of operator learning problems. We also present a spatial mixture-of-experts (MoE) DeepONet trunk network architecture that utilizes a partition-of-unity (PoU) approximation to promote spatial locality and model sparsity in the operator learning problem. We first prove that both the ensemble and PoU-MoE DeepONets are universal approximators. We then demonstrate that ensemble DeepONets containing a trunk ensemble of a standard trunk, the PoU-MoE trunk, and/or a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) trunk can achieve 2-4x lower relative $\ell_2$ errors than standard DeepONets and POD-DeepONets on both standard and challenging new operator learning problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) in two and three dimensions. Our new PoU-MoE formulation provides a natural way to incorporate spatial locality and model sparsity into any neural network architecture, while our new ensemble DeepONet provides a powerful and general framework for incorporating basis enrichment in scientific machine learning architectures for operator learning.</description>

      <title>Scrutinize What We Ignore: Reining In Task Representation Shift Of Context-Based Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent representation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we find it ignores the variation of the task representation in the alternating optimization process, which weakens the condition necessary for monotonic performance improvements, and may therefore violate the monotonicity.We name this issue \underline{task representation shift} and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates.We use different settings to rein in the task representation shift on three widely adopted training objectives concerning maximizing $I(Z;M)$ across different data qualities.Empirical results show that reining in the task representation shift can indeed improve performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study min-max algorithms to solve zero-sum differential games on Riemannian manifold. Based on the notions of differential Stackelberg equilibrium and differential Nash equilibrium on Riemannian manifold, we analyze the local convergence of two representative deterministic simultaneous algorithms $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA to such equilibrium. Sufficient conditions are obtained to establish their linear convergence rates by Ostrowski theorem on manifold and spectral analysis. The $\tau$-SGA algorithm is extended from the symplectic gradient-adjustment method in Euclidean space to avoid strong rotational dynamics in $\tau$-GDA. In some cases, we obtain a faster convergence rate of $\tau$-SGA through an asymptotic analysis which is valid when the learning rate ratio $\tau$ is big. We show numerically how the insights obtained from the convergence analysis may improve the training of orthogonal Wasserstein GANs using stochastic $\tau$-GDA and $\tau$-SGA on simple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HOPE for a Robust Parameterization of Long-memory State Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, an SSM often needs a specifically designed initialization, and the training of state matrices is on a logarithmic scale with a very small learning rate. To understand these choices from a unified perspective, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory. Building upon it, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. Our approach helps improve the initialization and training stability, leading to a more robust parameterization. We efficiently implement these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and they require fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, our new parameterization endows the SSM with non-decaying memory within a fixed time window, which is empirically corroborated by a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise.</description>

Abstract: Generative models unfairly penalize data belonging to minority classes, suffer from model autophagy disorder (MADness), and learn biased estimates of the underlying distribution parameters. Our theoretical and empirical results show that training generative models with intentionally designed hypernetworks leads to models that 1) are more fair when generating datapoints belonging to minority classes 2) are more stable in a self-consumed (i.e., MAD) setting, and 3) learn parameters that are less statistically biased. To further mitigate unfairness, MADness, and bias, we introduce a regularization term that penalizes discrepancies between a generative model's estimated weights when trained on real data versus its own synthetic data. To facilitate training existing deep generative models within our framework, we offer a scalable implementation of hypernetworks that automatically generates a hypernetwork architecture for any given generative model.</description>

      <title>One-shot Active Learning Based on Lewis Weight Sampling for Multiple Deep Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) for multiple target models aims to reduce labeled data querying while effectively training multiple models concurrently. Existing AL algorithms often rely on iterative model training, which can be computationally expensive, particularly for deep models. In this paper, we propose a one-shot AL method to address this challenge, which performs all label queries without repeated model training.
  Specifically, we extract different representations of the same dataset using distinct network backbones, and actively learn the linear prediction layer on each representation via an $\ell_p$-regression formulation. The regression problems are solved approximately by sampling and reweighting the unlabeled instances based on their maximum Lewis weights across the representations. An upper bound on the number of samples needed is provided with a rigorous analysis for $p\in [1, +\infty)$.
  Experimental results on 11 benchmarks show that our one-shot approach achieves competitive performances with the state-of-the-art AL methods for multiple target models.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Training and Generalization of Pretrained Transformer for Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the supervised pre-trained transformer for a class of sequential decision-making problems. The class of considered problems is a subset of the general formulation of reinforcement learning in that there is no transition probability matrix; though seemingly restrictive, the subset class of problems covers bandits, dynamic pricing, and newsvendor problems as special cases. Such a structure enables the use of optimal actions/decisions in the pre-training phase, and the usage also provides new insights for the training and generalization of the pre-trained transformer. We first note the training of the transformer model can be viewed as a performative prediction problem, and the existing methods and theories largely ignore or cannot resolve an out-of-distribution issue. We propose a natural solution that includes the transformer-generated action sequences in the training procedure, and it enjoys better properties both numerically and theoretically. The availability of the optimal actions in the considered tasks also allows us to analyze the properties of the pre-trained transformer as an algorithm and explains why it may lack exploration and how this can be automatically resolved. Numerically, we categorize the advantages of pre-trained transformers over the structured algorithms such as UCB and Thompson sampling into three cases: (i) it better utilizes the prior knowledge in the pre-training data; (ii) it can elegantly handle the misspecification issue suffered by the structured algorithms; (iii) for short time horizon such as $T\le50$, it behaves more greedy and enjoys much better regret than the structured algorithms designed for asymptotic optimality.</description>

      <title>MallowsPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ElastoGen, a knowledge-driven AI model that generates physically accurate 4D elastodynamics. Unlike deep models that learn from video- or image-based observations, ElastoGen leverages the principles of physics and learns from established mathematical and optimization procedures. The core idea of ElastoGen is converting the differential equation, corresponding to the nonlinear force equilibrium, into a series of iterative local convolution-like operations, which naturally fit deep architectures. We carefully build our network module following this overarching design philosophy. ElastoGen is much more lightweight in terms of both training requirements and network scale than deep generative models. Because of its alignment with actual physical procedures, ElastoGen efficiently generates accurate dynamics for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and can be easily integrated with upstream and downstream deep modules to enable end-to-end 4D generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When there is a correlation between any pair of targets, one needs a prediction method that can handle vector-valued output. In this setting, multi-target learning is particularly important as it is widely used in various applications. This paper introduces new variants of decision trees that can handle not only multi-target output but also the constraints among the targets. We focus on the customization of conventional decision trees by adjusting the splitting criteria to handle the constraints and obtain feasible predictions. We present both an optimization-based exact approach and several heuristics, complete with a discussion on their respective advantages and disadvantages. To support our findings, we conduct a computational study to demonstrate and compare the results of the proposed approaches.</description>

      <title>NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</description>

      <title>Explainable Molecular Property Prediction: Aligning Chemical Concepts with Predictions via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing explainable molecular property predictions is critical for many scientific domains, such as drug discovery and material science. Though transformer-based language models have shown great potential in accurate molecular property prediction, they neither provide chemically meaningful explanations nor faithfully reveal the molecular structure-property relationships. In this work, we develop a framework for explainable molecular property prediction based on language models, dubbed as Lamole, which can provide chemical concepts-aligned explanations. We take a string-based molecular representation -- Group SELFIES -- as input tokens to pretrain and fine-tune our Lamole, as it provides chemically meaningful semantics. By disentangling the information flows of Lamole, we propose combining self-attention weights and gradients for better quantification of each chemically meaningful substructure's impact on the model's output. To make the explanations more faithfully respect the structure-property relationship, we then carefully craft a marginal loss to explicitly optimize the explanations to be able to align with the chemists' annotations. We bridge the manifold hypothesis with the elaborated marginal loss to prove that the loss can align the explanations with the tangent space of the data manifold, leading to concept-aligned explanations. Experimental results over six mutagenicity datasets and one hepatotoxicity dataset demonstrate Lamole can achieve comparable classification accuracy and boost the explanation accuracy by up to 14.3%, being the state-of-the-art in explainable molecular property prediction.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Online Multi-LLM Selection with Versatile Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of multi-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become increasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the \textit{C2MAB-V}, a \underline{C}ost-effective \underline{C}ombinatorial \underline{M}ulti-armed \underline{B}andit with \underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM selection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static approaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With multiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to handling user queries, \textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple LLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various collaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed online feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \textit{C2MAB-V} can effectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also balancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear programming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is addressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the local server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides optimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online updates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \textit{C2MAB-V} offers strict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art results for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we show that \textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency with nine LLMs for three application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Disentangling and Integrating Relational and Sensory Information in Transformer Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relational reasoning is a central component of generally intelligent systems, enabling robust and data-efficient inductive generalization. Recent empirical evidence shows that many existing neural architectures, including Transformers, struggle with tasks requiring relational reasoning. In this work, we distinguish between two types of information: sensory information about the properties of individual objects, and relational information about the relationships between objects. While neural attention provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the flow of sensory information between objects, the Transformer lacks an explicit computational mechanism for routing and processing relational information. To address this limitation, we propose an architectural extension of the Transformer framework that we call the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), featuring two distinct attention mechanisms: sensory attention for directing the flow of sensory information, and a novel relational attention mechanism for directing the flow of relational information. We empirically evaluate DAT on a diverse set of tasks ranging from synthetic relational benchmarks to complex real-world tasks such as language modeling and visual processing. Our results demonstrate that integrating explicit relational computational mechanisms into the Transformer architecture leads to significant performance gains in terms of data efficiency and parameter efficiency.</description>

      <title>Subspace Node Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We identify that, for effective node pruning, this subspace must be constructed using a triangular transformation matrix, a transformation which is equivalent to and unnormalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimised to maximally reduce node activations in our subspace and thereby form a more optimal ranking of nodes. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our proposed method reaches state of the art when pruning ImageNet trained VGG-16 and rivals more complex state of the art methods when pruning ResNet-50 networks across a range of pruning ratios.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models (SSMs) is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear SSMs. DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ in addition to the original physical variables $z_t$ and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on the new latent space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $r(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors remain Gaussian. Notably, the structured design of test distributions enables an analytical formula for the recursive computation, eliminating the accumulation of Monte Carlo sampling errors across time steps. DBF trains the Gaussian inverse observation operators $r(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments demonstrate that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in tasks where the true posterior distribution on physical space is significantly non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment of Diffusion Models with Direct Noise Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the alignment problem of diffusion models with a continuous reward function, which represents specific objectives for downstream tasks, such as increasing darkness or improving the aesthetics of images. The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO operates at inference-time, and thus is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, with the alignment occurring in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory to an effective probability regularization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on several important reward functions and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach can achieve state-of-the-art reward scores within a reasonable time budget for generation.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Optimization in Time-Varying Networks with Arbitrary Delays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a decentralized optimization problem for networks affected by communication delays. Examples of such networks include collaborative machine learning, sensor networks, and multi-agent systems. To mimic communication delays, we add virtual non-computing nodes to the network, resulting in directed graphs. This motivates investigating decentralized optimization solutions on directed graphs. Existing solutions assume nodes know their out-degrees, resulting in limited applicability. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel gossip-based algorithm, called DT-GO, that does not need to know the out-degrees. The algorithm is applicable in general directed networks, for example networks with delays or limited acknowledgment capabilities. We derive convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives, showing that our algorithm achieves the same complexity order as centralized Stochastic Gradient Descent. In other words, the effects of the graph topology and delays are confined to higher-order terms. Additionally, we extend our analysis to accommodate time-varying network topologies. Numerical simulations are provided to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call "system captions" or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Can Self-Improve At Web Agent Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training models to act as agents that can effectively navigate and perform actions in a complex environment, such as a web browser, has typically been challenging due to lack of training data. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated some capability to navigate novel environments as agents in a zero-shot or few-shot fashion, purely guided by natural language instructions as prompts. Recent research has also demonstrated LLMs have the capability to exceed their base performance through self-improvement, i.e. fine-tuning on data generated by the model itself. In this work, we explore the extent to which LLMs can self-improve their performance as agents in long-horizon tasks in a complex environment using the WebArena benchmark. In WebArena, an agent must autonomously navigate and perform actions on web pages to achieve a specified objective. We explore fine-tuning on three distinct synthetic training data mixtures and achieve a 31\% improvement in task completion rate over the base model on the WebArena benchmark through a self-improvement procedure. We additionally contribute novel evaluation metrics for assessing the performance, robustness, capabilities, and quality of trajectories of our fine-tuned agent models to a greater degree than simple, aggregate-level benchmark scores currently used to measure self-improvement.</description>

      <title>Tackling GenAI Copyright Issues: Originality Estimation and Genericization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03341v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While various techniques for mitigating copyright issues have been studied, significant risks remain. Here, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. As a practical implementation, we introduce PREGen, which combines our genericization method with an existing mitigation technique. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images. Compared to the existing method, PREGen reduces the likelihood of generating copyrighted characters by more than half when the names of copyrighted characters are used as the prompt, dramatically improving the performance. Additionally, while generative models can produce copyrighted characters even when their names are not directly mentioned in the prompt, PREGen almost entirely prevents the generation of such characters in these cases.</description>

      <title>Empirical Guidelines for Deploying LLMs onto Resource-constrained Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling laws have become the de facto guidelines for designing large language models (LLMs), but they were studied under the assumption of unlimited computing resources for both training and inference. As LLMs are increasingly used as personalized intelligent assistants, their customization (i.e., learning through fine-tuning) and deployment onto resource-constrained edge devices will become more and more prevalent. An urging but open question is how a resource-constrained computing environment would affect the design choices for a personalized LLM. We study this problem empirically in this work. In particular, we consider the tradeoffs among a number of key design factors and their intertwined impacts on learning efficiency and accuracy. The factors include the learning methods for LLM customization, the amount of personalized data used for learning customization, the types and sizes of LLMs, the compression methods of LLMs, the amount of time afforded to learn, and the difficulty levels of the target use cases. Through extensive experimentation and benchmarking, we draw a number of surprisingly insightful guidelines for deploying LLMs onto resource-constrained devices. For example, an optimal choice between parameter learning and RAG may vary depending on the difficulty of the downstream task, the longer fine-tuning time does not necessarily help the model, and a compressed LLM may be a better choice than an uncompressed LLM to learn from limited personalized data.</description>

      <title>Crafting Heavy-Tails in Weight Matrix Spectrum without Gradient Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training strategies for modern deep neural networks (NNs) tend to induce a heavy-tailed (HT) empirical spectral density (ESD) in the layer weights. While previous efforts have shown that the HT phenomenon correlates with good generalization in large NNs, a theoretical explanation of its occurrence is still lacking. Especially, understanding the conditions which lead to this phenomenon can shed light on the interplay between generalization and weight spectra. Our work aims to bridge this gap by presenting a simple, rich setting to model the emergence of HT ESD. In particular, we present a theory-informed analysis for 'crafting' heavy tails in the ESD of two-layer NNs without any gradient noise. This is the first work to analyze a noise-free setting and incorporate optimizer (GD/Adam) dependent (large) learning rates into the HT ESD analysis. Our results highlight the role of learning rates on the Bulk+Spike and HT shape of the ESDs in the early phase of training, which can facilitate generalization in the two-layer NN. These observations shed light on the behavior of large-scale NNs, albeit in a much simpler setting. Last but not least, we present a novel perspective on the ESD evolution dynamics by analyzing the singular vectors of weight matrices and optimizer updates.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Sharpness-Aware Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has been instrumental in improving deep neural network training by minimizing both the training loss and the sharpness of the loss landscape, leading the model into flatter minima that are associated with better generalization properties. In another aspect, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a framework designed to improve the adaptability of models. MAML optimizes a set of meta-models that are specifically tailored for quick adaptation to multiple tasks with minimal fine-tuning steps and can generalize well with limited data. In this work, we explore the connection between SAM and MAML in enhancing model generalization. We introduce Agnostic-SAM, a novel approach that combines the principles of both SAM and MAML. Agnostic-SAM adapts the core idea of SAM by optimizing the model toward wider local minima using training data, while concurrently maintaining low loss values on validation data. By doing so, it seeks flatter minima that are not only robust to small perturbations but also less vulnerable to data distributional shift problems. Our experimental results demonstrate that Agnostic-SAM significantly improves generalization over baselines across a range of datasets and under challenging conditions such as noisy labels or data limitation.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Pretraining Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pretraining for partial differential equation (PDE) modeling has recently shown promise in scaling neural operators across datasets to improve generalizability and performance. Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining can be additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution. Through providing insights into pretraining neural operators for physics prediction, we hope to motivate future work in developing and evaluating pretraining methods for PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Graph Pooling Benchmark: Effectiveness, Robustness and Generalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 17 graph pooling methods and 28 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis, backbone analysis, parameter analysis and visualization to provide more evidence. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research. The source code of our benchmark is available at https://github.com/goose315/Graph_Pooling_Benchmark.</description>

      <title>FairCoT: Enhancing Fairness in Diffusion Models via Chain of Thought Reasoning of Multimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in diffusion models through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models (LLMs). FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement and attire-based attribute prediction to systematically mitigate biases, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero-shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across multiple models, including DALL-E and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly improves fairness and diversity metrics without compromising image quality or relevance. Our approach advances ethical AI practices in generative modeling, promoting socially responsible content generation and setting new standards for fairness in AI-generated imagery.</description>

      <title>HoTPP Benchmark: Are We Good at the Long Horizon Events Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting multiple future events within a given time horizon is crucial for finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare applications. Event timing and labels are typically modeled using Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP), with evaluations often focused on next-event prediction quality. While some studies have extended evaluations to a fixed number of future events, we demonstrate that this approach leads to inaccuracies in handling false positives and false negatives. To address these issues, we propose a novel evaluation method inspired by object detection techniques from computer vision. Specifically, we introduce Temporal mean Average Precision (T-mAP), a temporal variant of mAP, which overcomes the limitations of existing long-horizon evaluation metrics. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that models with strong next-event prediction accuracy can yield poor long-horizon forecasts and vice versa, indicating that specialized methods are needed for each task. To support further research, we release HoTPP, the first benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating long-horizon MTPP predictions. HoTPP includes large-scale datasets with up to 43 million events and provides optimized procedures for both autoregressive and parallel inference, paving the way for future advancements in the field.</description>

      <title>Theory on Mixture-of-Experts in Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has garnered significant attention because of its ability to adapt to new tasks that arrive over time. Catastrophic forgetting (of old tasks) has been identified as a major issue in CL, as the model adapts to new tasks. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has recently been shown to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CL, by employing a gating network to sparsify and distribute diverse tasks among multiple experts. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of MoE and its impact on the learning performance in CL. This paper provides the first theoretical results to characterize the impact of MoE in CL via the lens of overparameterized linear regression tasks. We establish the benefit of MoE over a single expert by proving that the MoE model can diversify its experts to specialize in different tasks, while its router learns to select the right expert for each task and balance the loads across all experts. Our study further suggests an intriguing fact that the MoE in CL needs to terminate the update of the gating network after sufficient training rounds to attain system convergence, which is not needed in the existing MoE studies that do not consider the continual task arrival. Furthermore, we provide explicit expressions for the expected forgetting and overall generalization error to characterize the benefit of MoE in the learning performance in CL. Interestingly, adding more experts requires additional rounds before convergence, which may not enhance the learning performance. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real datasets to extend these insights from linear models to deep neural networks (DNNs), which also shed light on the practical algorithm design for MoE in CL.</description>

      <title>FastCLIP: A Suite of Optimization Techniques to Accelerate CLIP Training with Limited Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies of training state-of-the-art Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models on large-scale data involve hundreds of or even thousands of GPUs due to the requirement of a large batch size. However, such a large amount of resources is not accessible to most people. While advanced compositional optimization techniques for optimizing global contrastive losses have been demonstrated effective for removing the requirement of large batch size, their performance on large-scale data remains underexplored and not optimized. To bridge the gap, this paper explores several aspects of CLIP training with limited resources (e.g., up to tens of GPUs). First, we introduce FastCLIP, a general CLIP training framework built on advanced compositional optimization techniques while designed and optimized for the distributed setting. Our framework is equipped with an efficient gradient reduction strategy to reduce communication overhead. Second, to further boost training efficiency, we investigate three components of the framework from an optimization perspective: the schedule of the inner learning rate, the update rules of the temperature parameter and the model parameters, respectively. Experiments on different strategies for each component shed light on how to conduct CLIP training more efficiently. Finally, we benchmark the performance of FastCLIP and the state-of-the-art training baseline (OpenCLIP) on different compute scales up to 32 GPUs on 8 nodes, and three data scales ranging from 2.7 million, 9.1 million to 315 million image-text pairs to demonstrate the significant improvement of FastCLIP in the resource-limited setting. We release the code of FastCLIP at https://github.com/Optimization-AI/fast_clip .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and plan near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method on three tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D jellyfish movement control, and 2D high-dimensional smoke control, where our generated jellyfish dataset is released as a benchmark for complex physical system control research. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics. The project website, jellyfish dataset, and code can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/diffphycon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique "squeezing effect" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.</description>

      <title>Correlations Are Ruining Your Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.</description>

      <title>EfficientQAT: Efficient Quantization-Aware Training for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

      <title>Adaptive Cascading Network for Continual Test-Time Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of continual test-time adaption where the goal is to adapt a source pre-trained model to a sequence of unlabelled target domains at test time. Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several limitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2) Interference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the ability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these challenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the feature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between them and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is structured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the interference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast adaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we introduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer, to effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach in a range of tasks including image classification, text classification, and speech recognition.</description>

      <title>Temporal Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</description>

      <title>Comparing and Contrasting Deep Learning Weather Prediction Backbones on Navier-Stokes and Atmospheric Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkable progress in the development of Deep Learning Weather Prediction (DLWP) models positions them to become competitive with traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Indeed, a wide number of DLWP architectures -- based on various backbones, including U-Net, Transformer, Graph Neural Network (GNN), and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) -- have demonstrated their potential at forecasting atmospheric states. However, due to differences in training protocols, forecast horizons, and data choices, it remains unclear which (if any) of these methods and architectures are most suitable for weather forecasting and for future model development. Here, we step back and provide a detailed empirical analysis, under controlled conditions, comparing and contrasting the most prominent DLWP models, along with their backbones. We accomplish this by predicting synthetic two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and real-world global weather dynamics. In terms of accuracy, memory consumption, and runtime, our results illustrate various tradeoffs. For example, on synthetic data, we observe favorable performance of FNO; and on the real-world WeatherBench dataset, our results demonstrate the suitability of ConvLSTM and SwinTransformer for short-to-mid-ranged forecasts. For long-ranged weather rollouts of up to 365 days, we observe superior stability and physical soundness in architectures that formulate a spherical data representation, i.e., GraphCast and Spherical FNO. In addition, we observe that all of these model backbones "saturate," i.e., none of them exhibit so-called neural scaling, which highlights an important direction for future work on these and related models.

      <title>Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14207v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern large language models are built on sequence modeling via next-token prediction. While the Transformer remains the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, its quadratic decoding complexity in sequence length poses a major limitation. State-space models (SSMs) present a competitive alternative, offering linear decoding efficiency while maintaining parallelism during training. However, most existing SSMs rely on linear recurrence designs that appear somewhat ad hoc. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from solving these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture, Longhorn, whose update resembles the closed-form solution for solving the online associative recall problem. Our experimental results show that Longhorn outperforms state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks, language modeling, and vision tasks. Specifically, Longhorn achieves a 1.8x improvement in sample efficiency compared to Mamba, and can extrapolate over contexts that are up to 16x longer during inference.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Reinforcement Learning via Causality-Guided Self-Adaptive Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General intelligence requires quick adaption across tasks. While existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods have made progress in generalization, they typically assume only distribution changes between source and target domains. In this paper, we explore a wider range of scenarios where not only the distribution but also the environment spaces may change. For example, in the CoinRun environment, we train agents from easy levels and generalize them to difficulty levels where there could be new enemies that have never occurred before. To address this challenging setting, we introduce a causality-guided self-adaptive representation-based approach, called CSR, that equips the agent to generalize effectively across tasks with evolving dynamics. Specifically, we employ causal representation learning to characterize the latent causal variables within the RL system. Such compact causal representations uncover the structural relationships among variables, enabling the agent to autonomously determine whether changes in the environment stem from distribution shifts or variations in space, and to precisely locate these changes. We then devise a three-step strategy to fine-tune the causal model under different scenarios accordingly. Empirical experiments show that CSR efficiently adapts to the target domains with only a few samples and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of scenarios, including our simulated environments, CartPole, CoinRun and Atari games.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Beyond Closure Models: Learning Chaotic-Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 120x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 5\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $58$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\sim205\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In graph learning the graph and the node features both contain noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to jointly rewire the graph and denoise the features, which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR improves the alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To approximately solve the associated non-convex optimization problem we propose a heuristic that efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and verify the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets. The results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on node classification using GNNs as downstream models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chip design relies heavily on generating Boolean circuits, such as AND-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), from functional descriptions like truth tables. This generation operation is a key process in logic synthesis, a primary chip design stage. While recent advances in deep learning have aimed to accelerate circuit design, these efforts have mostly focused on tasks other than synthesis, and traditional heuristic methods have plateaued. In this paper, we introduce ShortCircuit, a novel transformer-based architecture that leverages the structural properties of AIGs and performs efficient space exploration. Contrary to prior approaches attempting end-to-end generation of logic circuits using deep networks, ShortCircuit employs a two-phase process combining supervised with reinforcement learning to enhance generalization to unseen truth tables. We also propose an AlphaZero variant to handle the double exponentially large state space and the reward sparsity, enabling the discovery of near-optimal designs. To evaluate the generative performance of our model , we extract 500 truth tables from a set of 20 real-world circuits. ShortCircuit successfully generates AIGs for $98\%$ of the 8-input test truth tables, and outperforms the state-of-the-art logic synthesis tool, ABC, by $18.62\%$ in terms of circuits size.</description>

      <title>DeTPP: Leveraging Object Detection for Robust Long-Horizon Event Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-horizon event forecasting is critical across various domains, including retail, finance, healthcare, and social networks. Traditional methods, such as Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP), often rely on autoregressive models to predict multiple future events. However, these models frequently suffer from issues like converging to constant or repetitive outputs, which limits their effectiveness and general applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce DeTPP (Detection-based Temporal Point Processes), a novel approach inspired by object detection techniques from computer vision. DeTPP employs a unique matching-based loss function that selectively prioritizes reliably predictable events, improving the accuracy and diversity of predictions during inference. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art in long-horizon event forecasting, achieving up to a 77% relative improvement over existing MTPP and next-K methods. The proposed hybrid approach enhances the accuracy of next event prediction by up to 2.7% on a large transactional dataset. Notably, DeTPP is also among the fastest methods for inference. The implementation of DeTPP is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Rapid Gyroscope Calibration: A Deep Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-cost gyroscope calibration is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of gyroscope measurements. Stationary calibration estimates the deterministic parts of measurement errors. To this end, a common practice is to average the gyroscope readings during a predefined period and estimate the gyroscope bias. Calibration duration plays a crucial role in performance, therefore, longer periods are preferred. However, some applications require quick startup times and calibration is therefore allowed only for a short time. In this work, we focus on reducing low-cost gyroscope calibration time using deep learning methods. We propose a deep-learning framework and explore the possibilities of using multiple real and virtual gyroscopes to improve the calibration performance of single gyroscopes. To train and validate our approach, we recorded a dataset consisting of 169 hours of gyroscope readings, using 24 gyroscopes of two different brands. We also created a virtual dataset consisting of simulated gyroscope readings. The two datasets were used to evaluate our proposed approach. One of our key achievements in this work is reducing gyroscope calibration time by up to 89% using three low-cost gyroscopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have gained attention as general-purpose solvers due to their ability to automatically learn problem-specific heuristics, reducing the need for manually crafted heuristics. However, these methods often face scalability challenges. To address these issues, the improved Sampling algorithm for Combinatorial Optimization (iSCO), using discrete Langevin dynamics, has been proposed, demonstrating better performance than several learning-based solvers. This study proposes a different approach that integrates gradient-based update through continuous relaxation, combined with Quasi-Quantum Annealing (QQA). QQA smoothly transitions the objective function, starting from a simple convex function, minimized at half-integral values, to the original objective function, where the relaxed variables are minimized only in the discrete space. Furthermore, we incorporate parallel run communication leveraging GPUs to enhance exploration capabilities and accelerate convergence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method is a competitive general-purpose solver, achieving performance comparable to iSCO and learning-based solvers across various benchmark problems. Notably, our method exhibits superior speed-quality trade-offs for large-scale instances compared to iSCO, learning-based solvers, commercial solvers, and specialized algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the efficacy of jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.</description>

Abstract: Tabular data is the most common type of data in real-life scenarios. In this study, we propose the TabKANet model for tabular data modeling, which targets the bottlenecks in learning from numerical content. We constructed a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) based Numerical Embedding Module and unified numerical and categorical features encoding within a Transformer architecture. TabKANet has demonstrated stable and significantly superior performance compared to Neural Networks (NNs) across multiple public datasets in binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks. Its performance is comparable to or surpasses that of Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models (GBDTs). Our code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/AI-thpremed/TabKANet.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Models for Controllable RNA Sequence Generation</title>

Abstract: This work presents RNAdiffusion, a latent diffusion model for generating and optimizing discrete RNA sequences of variable lengths. RNA is a key intermediary between DNA and protein, exhibiting high sequence diversity and complex three-dimensional structures to support a wide range of functions. We utilize pretrained BERT-type models to encode raw RNA sequences into token-level, biologically meaningful representations. A Query Transformer is employed to compress such representations into a set of fixed-length latent vectors, with an autoregressive decoder trained to reconstruct RNA sequences from these latent variables. We then develop a continuous diffusion model within this latent space. To enable optimization, we integrate the gradients of reward models--surrogates for RNA functional properties--into the backward diffusion process, thereby generating RNAs with high reward scores. Empirical results confirm that RNAdiffusion generates non-coding RNAs that align with natural distributions across various biological metrics. Further, we fine-tune the diffusion model on mRNA 5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs) and optimize sequences for high translation efficiencies. Our guided diffusion model effectively generates diverse 5'-UTRs with high Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL) and Translation Efficiency (TE), outperforming baselines in balancing rewards and structural stability trade-off. Our findings hold potential for advancing RNA sequence-function research and therapeutic RNA design.</description>

      <title>Extracting Memorized Training Data via Decomposition</title>

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in society creates new information security challenges for developers, organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact contents of the source training datasets poses security and safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be tricked into divulging training data by using out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based decompositional method to extract news articles from two frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723 New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim sentence from 73 articles, and over 20% of verbatim sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning that they likely originate from the source training dataset. This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require careful consideration from model development to its end-use.</description>

      <title>On-Device Collaborative Language Modeling via a Mixture of Generalists and Specialists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-device LLMs have gained increasing attention for their ability to enhance privacy and provide a personalized user experience. To facilitate learning with private and scarce local data, federated learning has become a standard approach, though it introduces challenges related to system and data heterogeneity among end users. As a solution, we propose a novel $\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning approach with a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists (CoMiGS), being the first to effectively address both. Our approach distinguishes generalists and specialists by aggregating certain experts across end users while keeping others localized to specialize in user-specific datasets. A key innovation of our method is the bi-level optimization formulation of the Mixture-of-Experts learning objective, where the router is updated using a separate validation set that represents the target distribution. CoMiGS effectively balances collaboration and personalization, as demonstrated by its superior performance in scenarios with high data heterogeneity across multiple datasets. By design, our approach accommodates users' varying computational resources through different numbers of specialists. By decoupling resource abundance from data quantity, CoMiGS remains robust against overfitting-due to the generalists' regularizing effect-while adapting to local data through specialist expertise.</description>

      <title>Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability.
  We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</description>

      <title>Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning is Fine, if Calibrated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fine-tuning is arguably the most straightforward way to tailor a pre-trained model (e.g., a foundation model) to downstream applications, but it also comes with the risk of losing valuable knowledge the model had learned in pre-training. For example, fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier capable of recognizing a large number of classes to master a subset of classes at hand is shown to drastically degrade the model's accuracy in the other classes it had previously learned. As such, it is hard to further use the fine-tuned model when it encounters classes beyond the fine-tuning data. In this paper, we systematically dissect the issue, aiming to answer the fundamental question, "What has been damaged in the fine-tuned model?" To our surprise, we find that the fine-tuned model neither forgets the relationship among the other classes nor degrades the features to recognize these classes. Instead, the fine-tuned model often produces more discriminative features for these other classes, even if they were missing during fine-tuning! {What really hurts the accuracy is the discrepant logit scales between the fine-tuning classes and the other classes}, implying that a simple post-processing calibration would bring back the pre-trained model's capability and at the same time unveil the feature improvement over all classes. We conduct an extensive empirical study to demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide preliminary explanations underlying them, suggesting new directions for future theoretical analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-MLB/Fine-Tuning-Is-Fine-If-Calibrated.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from a Unifying Empirical Study of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) in Visual Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has attracted significant attention lately, due to the increasing size of pre-trained models and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. This community-wide enthusiasm has sparked a plethora of approaches. Nevertheless, a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking, leaving questions like when to apply PETL and which approach to use largely unanswered. In this paper, we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PETL methods in the context of Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyper-parameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study not only offers a valuable user guide but also unveils several new insights. First, if tuned carefully, different PETL methods can obtain similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple methods like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second, though with similar accuracy, we find that PETL methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions, likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementariness) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods, and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third, going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks, we find that PETL is also useful in many-shot regimes -- it achieves comparable and sometimes better accuracy than full FT, using much fewer learnable parameters. Last but not least, we investigate PETL's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., a CLIP backbone). Perhaps not surprisingly, PETL methods outperform full FT alone. However, with weight-space ensembles, the fully fine-tuned model can better balance target (i.e., downstream) distribution and distribution shift performance, suggesting a future research direction for PETL.</description>

      <title>HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is widely used in Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. Traditional RL can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. RLHF complicates the dataflow by expanding each node into a distributed LLM training or generation program, and each edge into a many-to-many multicast. Traditional RL frameworks execute the dataflow using a single controller to instruct both intra-node computation and inter-node communication, which can be inefficient in RLHF due to large control dispatch overhead for distributed intra-node computation. Existing RLHF systems adopt a multi-controller paradigm, which can be inflexible due to nesting distributed computation and data communication. We propose HybridFlow, which combines single-controller and multi-controller paradigms in a hybrid manner to enable flexible representation and efficient execution of the RLHF dataflow. We carefully design a set of hierarchical APIs that decouple and encapsulate computation and data dependencies in the complex RLHF dataflow, allowing efficient operation orchestration to implement RLHF algorithms and flexible mapping of the computation onto various devices. We further design a 3D-HybridEngine for efficient actor model resharding between training and generation phases, with zero memory redundancy and significantly reduced communication overhead. Our experimental results demonstrate 1.53$\times$~20.57$\times$ throughput improvement when running various RLHF algorithms using HybridFlow, as compared with state-of-the-art baselines. HybridFlow source code will be available at https://github.com/volcengine/verl.</description>

      <title>RMLR: Extending Multinomial Logistic Regression into General Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riemannian neural networks, which extend deep learning techniques to Riemannian spaces, have gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started extending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian manifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes a framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to as RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus exhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of geometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation matrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five types of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based on the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different Riemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

Abstract: Tabular average reward Temporal Difference (TD) learning is perhaps the simplest and the most fundamental policy evaluation algorithm in average reward reinforcement learning. After at least 25 years since its discovery, we are finally able to provide a long-awaited almost sure convergence analysis. Namely, we are the first to prove that, under very mild conditions, tabular average reward TD converges almost surely to a sample path dependent fixed point. Key to this success is a new general stochastic approximation result concerning nonexpansive mappings with Markovian and additive noise, built on recent advances in stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations.</description>

      <title>DropEdge not Foolproof: Effective Augmentation Method for Signed Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper discusses signed graphs, which model friendly or antagonistic relationships using edges marked with positive or negative signs, focusing on the task of link sign prediction. While Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have advanced, they face challenges like graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles. The authors propose using data augmentation (DA) techniques to address these issues, although many existing methods are not suitable for signed graphs due to a lack of side information. They highlight that the random DropEdge method, a rare DA approach applicable to signed graphs, does not enhance link sign prediction performance. In response, they introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation (SGA) framework, which includes a structure augmentation module to identify candidate edges and a strategy for selecting beneficial candidates, ultimately improving SGNN training. Experimental results show that SGA significantly boosts the performance of SGNN models, with a notable 32.3% improvement in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset.</description>

      <title>HYDRA-FL: Hybrid Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Accurate Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity among Federated Learning (FL) users poses a significant challenge, resulting in reduced global model performance. The community has designed various techniques to tackle this issue, among which Knowledge Distillation (KD)-based techniques are common.
  While these techniques effectively improve performance under high heterogeneity, they inadvertently cause higher accuracy degradation under model poisoning attacks (known as attack amplification). This paper presents a case study to reveal this critical vulnerability in KD-based FL systems. We show why KD causes this issue through empirical evidence and use it as motivation to design a hybrid distillation technique. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hybrid Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Accurate FL (HYDRA-FL), which reduces the impact of attacks in attack scenarios by offloading some of the KD loss to a shallow layer via an auxiliary classifier. We model HYDRA-FL as a generic framework and adapt it to two KD-based FL algorithms, FedNTD and MOON. Using these two as case studies, we demonstrate that our technique outperforms baselines in attack settings while maintaining comparable performance in benign settings.</description>

      <title>Scaling Optimal LR Across Token Horizons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art LLMs are powered by scaling -- scaling model size, dataset size and cluster size. It is economically infeasible to extensively tune hyperparameter for the largest runs. Instead, approximately optimal hyperparameters must be inferred or \textit{transferred} from smaller experiments. Hyperparameter transfer across model sizes has been studied in Yang et al. However, hyperparameter transfer across dataset size -- or token horizon -- has not been studied yet. To remedy this we conduct a large scale empirical study on how optimal learning rate (LR) depends on token horizon in LLM training. We first demonstrate that the optimal LR changes significantly with token horizon -- longer training necessitates smaller LR. Secondly we demonstrate the the optimal LR follows a scaling law, and that the optimal LR for longer horizons can be accurately estimated from shorter horizons via such scaling laws. We also provide a rule-of-thumb for transferring LR across token horizons with zero overhead over current practices. Lastly we provide evidence that LLama-1 used too high LR, and estimate the performance hit from this. We thus argue that hyperparameter transfer across data size is an important and overlooked component of LLM training.</description>

      <title>Federated Instruction Tuning of LLMs with Domain Coverage Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Domain-specific Instruction Tuning (FedDIT) utilizes limited cross-client private data together with server-side public data for instruction augmentation, ultimately boosting model performance within specific domains. To date, the factors affecting FedDIT remain unclear, and existing instruction augmentation methods primarily focus on the centralized setting without considering distributed environments. Our experiments reveal that the cross-client domain coverage, rather than data heterogeneity, drives model performance in FedDIT. In response, we propose FedDCA, which optimizes domain coverage through greedy client center selection and retrieval-based augmentation. For client-side computational efficiency and system scalability, FedDCA$^*$, the variant of FedDCA, utilizes heterogeneous encoders with server-side feature alignment. Extensive experiments across four distinct domains (code, medical, financial, and mathematical) substantiate the effectiveness of both methods. Additionally, we investigate privacy preservation against memory extraction attacks utilizing various amounts of public data. Results show that there is no significant correlation between the volume of public data and the privacy-preserving capability. However, as the fine-tuning rounds increase, the risk of privacy leakage reduces or converges.</description>

      <title>Linear Projections of Teacher Embeddings for Few-Class Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex teacher model to a smaller student model. Traditionally, KD involves training the student to mimic the teacher's output probabilities, while more advanced techniques have explored guiding the student to adopt the teacher's internal representations. Despite its widespread success, the performance of KD in binary classification and few-class problems has been less satisfactory. This is because the information about the teacher model's generalization patterns scales directly with the number of classes. Moreover, several sophisticated distillation methods may not be universally applicable or effective for data types beyond Computer Vision. Consequently, effective distillation techniques remain elusive for a range of key real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis, search query understanding, and advertisement-query relevance assessment. Taking these observations into account, we introduce a novel method for distilling knowledge from the teacher's model representations, which we term Learning Embedding Linear Projections (LELP). Inspired by recent findings about the structure of final-layer representations, LELP works by identifying informative linear subspaces in the teacher's embedding space, and splitting them into pseudo-subclasses. The student model is then trained to replicate these pseudo-classes. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale NLP benchmarks like Amazon Reviews and Sentiment140 demonstrate the LELP is consistently competitive with, and typically superior to, existing state-of-the-art distillation algorithms for binary and few-class problems, where most KD methods suffer.</description>

      <title>Optimal Causal Representations and the Causal Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct representations that simplify parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach in representation learning that compresses random variables while retaining information about a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces representations which are causally interpretable, and which can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned representations accurately capture causality as intended.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing and finding anomalies in multi-dimensional datasets is a cumbersome but vital task across different domains. In the context of financial fraud detection, analysts must quickly identify suspicious activity among transactional data. This is an iterative process made of complex exploratory tasks such as recognizing patterns, grouping, and comparing. To mitigate the information overload inherent to these steps, we present a tool combining automated information highlights, Large Language Model generated textual insights, and visual analytics, facilitating exploration at different levels of detail. We perform a segmentation of the data per analysis area and visually represent each one, making use of automated visual cues to signal which require more attention. Upon user selection of an area, our system provides textual and graphical summaries. The text, acting as a link between the high-level and detailed views of the chosen segment, allows for a quick understanding of relevant details. A thorough exploration of the data comprising the selection can be done through graphical representations. The feedback gathered in a study performed with seven domain experts suggests our tool effectively supports and guides exploratory analysis, easing the identification of suspicious information.</description>

      <title>On exploring the potential of quantum auto-encoder for learning quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequent interactions between quantum computing and machine learning revolutionize both fields. One prototypical achievement is the quantum auto-encoder (QAE), as the leading strategy to relieve the curse of dimensionality ubiquitous in the quantum world. Despite its attractive capabilities, practical applications of QAE have yet largely unexplored. To narrow this knowledge gap, here we devise three effective QAE-based learning protocols to address three classically computational hard learning problems when learning quantum systems, which are low-rank state fidelity estimation, quantum Fisher information estimation, and Gibbs state preparation. Attributed to the versatility of QAE, our proposals can be readily executed on near-term quantum machines. Besides, we analyze the error bounds of the trained protocols and showcase the necessary conditions to provide practical utility from the perspective of complexity theory. We conduct numerical simulations to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed three protocols. Our work sheds new light on developing advanced quantum learning algorithms to accomplish hard quantum physics and quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Complex-valued Federated Learning with Differential Privacy and MRI Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.03478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enhanced with Differential Privacy (DP) is a powerful privacy-preserving strategy to protect individuals sharing their sensitive data for processing in fields such as medicine and healthcare. Many medical applications, for example magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), rely on complex-valued signal processing techniques for data acquisition and analysis. However, the appropriate application of DP to complex-valued data is still underexplored. To address this issue, from the theoretical side, we introduce the complex-valued Gaussian mechanism, whose behaviour we characterise in terms of $f$-DP, $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP and R\'enyi-DP. Moreover, we generalise the fundamental algorithm DP stochastic gradient descent to complex-valued neural networks and present novel complex-valued neural network primitives compatible with DP. Experimentally, we showcase a proof-of-concept by training federated complex-valued neural networks with DP on a real-world task (MRI pulse sequence classification in $k$-space), yielding excellent utility and privacy. Our results highlight the relevance of combining federated learning with robust privacy-preserving techniques in the MRI context.</description>

      <title>Visual Acuity Prediction on Real-Life Patient Data Using a Machine Learning Based Multistage System</title>

Abstract: In ophthalmology, intravitreal operative medication therapy (IVOM) is a widespread treatment for diseases related to the age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the diabetic macular edema (DME), as well as the retinal vein occlusion (RVO). However, in real-world settings, patients often suffer from loss of vision on time scales of years despite therapy, whereas the prediction of the visual acuity (VA) and the earliest possible detection of deterioration under real-life conditions is challenging due to heterogeneous and incomplete data. In this contribution, we present a workflow for the development of a research-compatible data corpus fusing different IT systems of the department of ophthalmology of a German maximum care hospital. The extensive data corpus allows predictive statements of the expected progression of a patient and his or her VA in each of the three diseases. For the disease AMD, we found out a significant deterioration of the visual acuity over time. Within our proposed multistage system, we subsequently classify the VA progression into the three groups of therapy "winners", "stabilizers", and "losers" (WSL classification scheme). Our OCT biomarker classification using an ensemble of deep neural networks results in a classification accuracy (F1-score) of over 98 %, enabling us to complete incomplete OCT documentations while allowing us to exploit them for a more precise VA modeling process. Our VA prediction requires at least four VA examinations and optionally OCT biomarkers from the same time period to predict the VA progression within a forecasted time frame, whereas our prediction is currently restricted to IVOM / no therapy. We achieve a final prediction accuracy of 69 % in macro average F1-score, while being in the same range as the ophthalmologists with 57.8 and 50 +- 10.7 % F1-score.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bootstrap: New Privacy Analysis and Inference Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) mechanisms protect individual-level information by introducing randomness into the statistical analysis procedure. Despite the availability of numerous DP tools, there remains a lack of general techniques for conducting statistical inference under DP. We examine a DP bootstrap procedure that releases multiple private bootstrap estimates to infer the sampling distribution and construct confidence intervals (CIs). Our privacy analysis presents new results on the privacy cost of a single DP bootstrap estimate, applicable to any DP mechanism, and identifies some misapplications of the bootstrap in the existing literature. For the composition of the DP bootstrap, we present a numerical method to compute the exact privacy cost of releasing multiple DP bootstrap estimates, and using the Gaussian-DP (GDP) framework (Dong et al., 2022), we show that the release of $B$ DP bootstrap estimates from mechanisms satisfying $(\mu/\sqrt{(2-2/\mathrm{e})B})$-GDP asymptotically satisfies $\mu$-GDP as $B$ goes to infinity. Then, we perform private statistical inference by post-processing the DP bootstrap estimates. We prove that our point estimates are consistent, our standard CIs are asymptotically valid, and both enjoy optimal convergence rates. To further improve the finite performance, we use deconvolution with DP bootstrap estimates to accurately infer the sampling distribution. We derive CIs for tasks such as population mean estimation, logistic regression, and quantile regression, and we compare them to existing methods using simulations and real-world experiments on 2016 Canada Census data. Our private CIs achieve the nominal coverage level and offer the first approach to private inference for quantile regression.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Human Models for Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human models play a crucial role in human-robot interaction (HRI), enabling robots to consider the impact of their actions on people and plan their behavior accordingly. However, crafting good human models is challenging; capturing context-dependent human behavior requires significant prior knowledge and/or large amounts of interaction data, both of which are difficult to obtain. In this work, we explore the potential of large-language models (LLMs) -- which have consumed vast amounts of human-generated text data -- to act as zero-shot human models for HRI. Our experiments on three social datasets yield promising results; the LLMs are able to achieve performance comparable to purpose-built models. That said, we also discuss current limitations, such as sensitivity to prompts and spatial/numerical reasoning mishaps. Based on our findings, we demonstrate how LLM-based human models can be integrated into a social robot's planning process and applied in HRI scenarios. Specifically, we present one case study on a simulated trust-based table-clearing task and replicate past results that relied on custom models. Next, we conduct a new robot utensil-passing experiment (n = 65) where preliminary results show that planning with a LLM-based human model can achieve gains over a basic myopic plan. In summary, our results show that LLMs offer a promising (but incomplete) approach to human modeling for HRI.</description>

      <title>Fitting an ellipsoid to a quadratic number of random points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\mathrm{P})$ of fitting $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the boundary of a centered ellipsoid, as $n, d \to \infty$. This problem is conjectured to have a sharp feasibility transition: for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, if $n \leq (1 - \varepsilon) d^2 / 4$ then $(\mathrm{P})$ has a solution with high probability, while $(\mathrm{P})$ has no solutions with high probability if $n \geq (1 + \varepsilon) d^2 /4$. So far, only a trivial bound $n \geq d^2 / 2$ is known on the negative side, while the best results on the positive side assume $n \leq d^2 / \mathrm{polylog}(d)$. In this work, we improve over previous approaches using a key result of Bartl &amp; Mendelson (2022) on the concentration of Gram matrices of random vectors under mild assumptions on their tail behavior. This allows us to give a simple proof that $(\mathrm{P})$ is feasible with high probability when $n \leq d^2 / C$, for a (possibly large) constant $C &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Document-Level In-Context Few-Shot Relation Extraction via Pre-Trained Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11085v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Document-level relation extraction aims at inferring structured human knowledge from textual documents. State-of-the-art methods for this task use pre-trained language models (LMs) via fine-tuning, yet fine-tuning is computationally expensive and cannot adapt to new relation types or new LMs. As a remedy, we leverage the generalization capabilities of pre-trained LMs and present a novel framework for document-level in-context few-shot relation extraction. Our framework has three strengths: it eliminates the need (1) for named entity recognition and (2) for human annotations of documents, and (3) it can be updated to new LMs without re-training. We evaluate our framework using DocRED, the largest publicly available dataset for document-level relation extraction, and demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further show that our framework actually performs much better than the original labels from the development set of DocRED. Finally, we conduct an extensive benchmark demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework, achieving state-of-the-art results across six relation extraction datasets and outperforming more than 30 baseline methods. Unlike our framework, the baseline methods have large computational overhead (e.g., from fine-tuning). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to reformulate the document-level relation extraction task as a tailored in-context few-shot learning paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique with extensive clinical applications in ophthalmology. OCT enables the visualization of the retinal layers, playing a vital role in the early detection and monitoring of retinal diseases. OCT uses the principle of light wave interference to create detailed images of the retinal microstructures, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing ocular conditions. This work presents an open-access OCT dataset (OCTDL) comprising over 2000 OCT images labeled according to disease group and retinal pathology. The dataset consists of OCT records of patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), Epiretinal Membrane (ERM), Retinal Artery Occlusion (RAO), Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO), and Vitreomacular Interface Disease (VID). The images were acquired with an Optovue Avanti RTVue XR using raster scanning protocols with dynamic scan length and image resolution. Each retinal b-scan was acquired by centering on the fovea and interpreted and cataloged by an experienced retinal specialist. In this work, we applied Deep Learning classification techniques to this new open-access dataset.</description>

      <title>A Synthesis of Green Architectural Tactics for ML-Enabled Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has generated growing interest in understanding their environmental impact and the challenges associated with designing environmentally friendly ML-enabled systems. While Green AI research, i.e., research that tries to minimize the energy footprint of AI, is receiving increasing attention, very few concrete guidelines are available on how ML-enabled systems can be designed to be more environmentally sustainable. In this paper, we provide a catalog of 30 green architectural tactics for ML-enabled systems to fill this gap. An architectural tactic is a high-level design technique to improve software quality, in our case environmental sustainability. We derived the tactics from the analysis of 51 peer-reviewed publications that primarily explore Green AI, and validated them using a focus group approach with three experts. The 30 tactics we identified are aimed to serve as an initial reference guide for further exploration into Green AI from a software engineering perspective, and assist in designing sustainable ML-enabled systems. To enhance transparency and facilitate their widespread use and extension, we make the tactics available online in easily consumable formats. Wide-spread adoption of these tactics has the potential to substantially reduce the societal impact of ML-enabled systems regarding their energy and carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Learning Explainable and Better Performing Representations of POMDP Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) typically require memory. One way to represent this memory is via automata. We present a method to learn an automaton representation of a strategy using a modification of the L*-algorithm. Compared to the tabular representation of a strategy, the resulting automaton is dramatically smaller and thus also more explainable. Moreover, in the learning process, our heuristics may even improve the strategy's performance. In contrast to approaches that synthesize an automaton directly from the POMDP thereby solving it, our approach is incomparably more scalable.</description>

      <title>Routoo: Learning to Route to Large Language Models Effectively</title>

Abstract: LLMs with superior response quality--particularly larger or closed-source models--often come with higher inference costs, making their deployment inefficient and costly. Meanwhile, developing foundational LLMs from scratch is becoming increasingly resource-intensive and impractical for many applications. To address the challenge of balancing quality and cost, we introduce Routoo, an architecture designed to optimize the selection of LLMs for specific prompts based on performance, cost, and efficiency. Routoo provides controllability over the trade-off between inference cost and quality, enabling significant reductions in inference costs for a given quality requirement. Routoo comprises two key components: a performance predictor and cost-aware selector. The performance predictor is a lightweight LLM that estimates the expected performance of various underlying LLMs on a given prompt without executing them. The cost-aware selector module then selects the most suitable model based on these predictions and constraints such as cost and latency, significantly reducing inference costs for the same quality. We evaluated Routoo using the MMLU benchmark across 57 domains employing open-source models. Our results show that Routoo matches the performance of the Mixtral 8x7b model while reducing inference costs by one-third. Additionally, by allowing increased costs, Routoo surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by over 5% at equivalent costs, achieving an accuracy of 75.9%. When integrating GPT4 into our model pool, Routoo nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the cost and exceeds it with a 25% cost reduction. These outcomes highlight Routoo's potential to significantly reduce inference costs without compromising quality, and even to establish new state-of-the-art results by leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple LLMs.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Divergence Loss Function for Neural Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique for capturing relationships between two probability distributions. State-of-the-art DRE methods estimate the density ratio using neural networks trained with loss functions derived from variational representations of $f$-divergence. However, existing methods face optimization challenges, such as overfitting due to lower-unbounded loss functions, biased mini-batch gradients, vanishing training loss gradients, and high sample requirements for Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss functions. To address these issues, we focus on $\alpha$-divergence, which provides a suitable variational representation of $f$-divergence. Subsequently, a novel loss function for DRE, the $\alpha$-divergence loss function ($\alpha$-Div), is derived. $\alpha$-Div is concise but offers stable and effective optimization for DRE. The boundedness of $\alpha$-divergence provides the potential for successful DRE with data exhibiting high KL-divergence. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in optimization using $\alpha$-Div. However, the experiments also show that the proposed loss function offers no significant advantage over the KL-divergence loss function in terms of RMSE for DRE. This indicates that the accuracy of DRE is primarily determined by the amount of KL-divergence in the data and is less dependent on $\alpha$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Learning to Extract Structured Entities Using Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04437v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have significantly impacted the field of information extraction, with Language Models (LMs) playing a pivotal role in extracting structured information from unstructured text. Prior works typically represent information extraction as triplet-centric and use classical metrics such as precision and recall for evaluation. We reformulate the task to be entity-centric, enabling the use of diverse metrics that can provide more insights from various perspectives. We contribute to the field by introducing Structured Entity Extraction and proposing the Approximate Entity Set OverlaP (AESOP) metric, designed to appropriately assess model performance. Later, we introduce a new Multistage Structured Entity Extraction (MuSEE) model that harnesses the power of LMs for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency by decomposing the extraction task into multiple stages. Quantitative and human side-by-side evaluations confirm that our model outperforms baselines, offering promising directions for future advancements in structured entity extraction. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/microsoft/Structured-Entity-Extraction.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search for variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function. Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem. The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with an $\epsilon$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of other VQAs.</description>

      <title>Don't Just Say "I don't know"! Self-aligning Large Language Models for Responding to Unknown Questions with Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions, they often display a considerable level of overconfidence even when the question does not have a definitive answer. To avoid providing hallucinated answers to these unknown questions, existing studies typically investigate approaches to refusing to answer these questions. In this work, we propose a novel and scalable self-alignment method to utilize the LLM itself to enhance its response-ability to different types of unknown questions, being capable of not only refusing to answer but also providing explanation to the unanswerability of unknown questions. Specifically, the Self-Align method first employ a two-stage class-aware self-augmentation approach to generate a large amount of unknown question-response data. Then we conduct disparity-driven self-curation to select qualified data for fine-tuning the LLM itself for aligning the responses to unknown questions as desired. Experimental results on two datasets across four types of unknown questions validate the superiority of the Self-Align method over existing baselines in terms of three types of task formulation.</description>

      <title>Deep Separable Spatiotemporal Learning for Fast Dynamic Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an indispensable role in cardiac diagnosis. To enable fast imaging, the k-space data can be undersampled but the image reconstruction poses a great challenge of high-dimensional processing. This challenge necessitates extensive training data in deep learning reconstruction methods. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient approach, leveraging a dimension-reduced separable learning scheme that can perform exceptionally well even with highly limited training data. We design this new approach by incorporating spatiotemporal priors into the development of a Deep Separable Spatiotemporal Learning network (DeepSSL), which unrolls an iteration process of a 2D spatiotemporal reconstruction model with both temporal low-rankness and spatial sparsity. Intermediate outputs can also be visualized to provide insights into the network behavior and enhance interpretability. Extensive results on cardiac cine datasets demonstrate that the proposed DeepSSL surpasses state-of-the-art methods both visually and quantitatively, while reducing the demand for training cases by up to 75%. Additionally, its preliminary adaptability to unseen cardiac patients has been verified through a blind reader study conducted by experienced radiologists and cardiologists. Furthermore, DeepSSL enhances the accuracy of the downstream task of cardiac segmentation and exhibits robustness in prospectively undersampled real-time cardiac MRI.</description>

      <title>Sequential transport maps using SoS density estimation and $\alpha$-divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport-based density estimation methods are receiving growing interest because of their ability to efficiently generate samples from the approximated density. We further invertigate the sequential transport maps framework proposed from arXiv:2106.04170 arXiv:2303.02554, which builds on a sequence of composed Knothe-Rosenblatt (KR) maps. Each of those maps are built by first estimating an intermediate density of moderate complexity, and then by computing the exact KR map from a reference density to the precomputed approximate density. In our work, we explore the use of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) densities and $\alpha$-divergences for approximating the intermediate densities. Combining SoS densities with $\alpha$-divergence interestingly yields convex optimization problems which can be efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. The main advantage of $\alpha$-divergences is to enable working with unnormalized densities, which provides benefits both numerically and theoretically. In particular, we provide a new convergence analyses of the sequential transport maps based on information geometric properties of $\alpha$-divergences. The choice of intermediate densities is also crucial for the efficiency of the method. While tempered (or annealed) densities are the state-of-the-art, we introduce diffusion-based intermediate densities which permits to approximate densities known from samples only. Such intermediate densities are well-established in machine learning for generative modeling. Finally we propose low-dimensional maps (or lazy maps) for dealing with high-dimensional problems and numerically demonstrate our methods on Bayesian inference problems and unsupervised learning tasks.</description>

      <title>ParFormer: A Vision Transformer with Parallel Mixer and Sparse Channel Attention Patch Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks. However, their deep architectures often lead to high computational redundancy, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices. This paper introduces ParFormer, a novel vision transformer that addresses this challenge by incorporating a Parallel Mixer and a Sparse Channel Attention Patch Embedding (SCAPE). By combining convolutional and attention mechanisms, ParFormer improves feature extraction. This makes spatial feature extraction more efficient and cuts down on unnecessary computation. The SCAPE module further reduces computational redundancy while preserving essential feature information during down-sampling. Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K dataset show that ParFormer-T achieves 78.9\% Top-1 accuracy with a high throughput on a GPU that outperforms other small models with 2.56$\times$ higher throughput than MobileViT-S, 0.24\% faster than FasterNet-T2, and 1.79$\times$ higher than EdgeNeXt-S. For edge device deployment, ParFormer-T excels with a throughput of 278.1 images/sec, which is 1.38 $\times$ higher than EdgeNeXt-S and 2.36$\times$ higher than MobileViT-S, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in resource-constrained settings. The larger variant, ParFormer-L, reaches 83.5\% Top-1 accuracy, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, surpassing many state-of-the-art models. In COCO object detection, ParFormer-M achieves 40.7 AP for object detection and 37.6 AP for instance segmentation, surpassing models like ResNet-50, PVT-S and PoolFormer-S24 with significantly higher efficiency. These results validate ParFormer as a highly efficient and scalable model for both high-performance and resource-constrained scenarios, making it an ideal solution for edge-based AI applications.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models Using Contrast Sets: An Experimental Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of Natural Language Inference (NLI), especially in tasks involving the classification of multiple input texts, the Cross-Entropy Loss metric is widely employed as a standard for error measurement. However, this metric falls short in effectively evaluating a model's capacity to understand language entailments. In this study, we introduce an innovative technique for generating a contrast set for the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. Our strategy involves the automated substitution of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with their synonyms to preserve the original meaning of sentences. This method aims to assess whether a model's performance is based on genuine language comprehension or simply on pattern recognition. We conducted our analysis using the ELECTRA-small model. The model achieved an accuracy of 89.9% on the conventional SNLI dataset but showed a reduced accuracy of 72.5% on our contrast set, indicating a substantial 17% decline. This outcome led us to conduct a detailed examination of the model's learning behaviors. Following this, we improved the model's resilience by fine-tuning it with a contrast-enhanced training dataset specifically designed for SNLI, which increased its accuracy to 85.5% on the contrast sets. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating diverse linguistic expressions into datasets for NLI tasks. We hope that our research will encourage the creation of more inclusive datasets, thereby contributing to the development of NLI models that are both more sophisticated and effective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sequence-to-sequence mapping capacity of transformers by relating them to finite transducers, and find that they can express surprisingly large classes of transductions. We do so using variants of RASP, a programming language designed to help people "think like transformers," as an intermediate representation. We extend the existing Boolean variant B-RASP to sequence-to-sequence functions and show that it computes exactly the first-order rational functions (such as string rotation). Then, we introduce two new extensions. B-RASP[pos] enables calculations on positions (such as copying the first half of a string) and contains all first-order regular functions. S-RASP adds prefix sum, which enables additional arithmetic operations (such as squaring a string) and contains all first-order polyregular functions. Finally, we show that masked average-hard attention transformers can simulate S-RASP.</description>

      <title>Extract, Define, Canonicalize: An LLM-based Framework for Knowledge Graph Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in automated methods for knowledge graph creation (KGC) from input text. Progress on large language models (LLMs) has prompted a series of recent works applying them to KGC, e.g., via zero/few-shot prompting. Despite successes on small domain-specific datasets, these models face difficulties scaling up to text common in many real-world applications. A principal issue is that, in prior methods, the KG schema has to be included in the LLM prompt to generate valid triplets; larger and more complex schemas easily exceed the LLMs' context window length. Furthermore, there are scenarios where a fixed pre-defined schema is not available and we would like the method to construct a high-quality KG with a succinct self-generated schema. To address these problems, we propose a three-phase framework named Extract-Define-Canonicalize (EDC): open information extraction followed by schema definition and post-hoc canonicalization. EDC is flexible in that it can be applied to settings where a pre-defined target schema is available and when it is not; in the latter case, it constructs a schema automatically and applies self-canonicalization. To further improve performance, we introduce a trained component that retrieves schema elements relevant to the input text; this improves the LLMs' extraction performance in a retrieval-augmented generation-like manner. We demonstrate on three KGC benchmarks that EDC is able to extract high-quality triplets without any parameter tuning and with significantly larger schemas compared to prior works. Code for EDC is available at https://github.com/clear-nus/edc.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Independence Test in the Presence of Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Testing conditional independence has many applications, such as in Bayesian network learning and causal discovery. Different test methods have been proposed. However, existing methods generally can not work when only discretized observations are available. Specifically, consider $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ are observed variables, where $\tilde{X}_2$ is a discretization of latent variables $X_2$. Applying existing test methods to the observations of $X_1$, $\tilde{X}_2$ and $X_3$ can lead to a false conclusion about the underlying conditional independence of variables $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Motivated by this, we propose a conditional independence test specifically designed to accommodate the presence of such discretization. To achieve this, we design the bridge equations to recover the parameter reflecting the statistical information of the underlying latent continuous variables. An appropriate test statistic and its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of conditional independence have also been derived. Both theoretical results and empirical validation have been provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of our test methods.</description>

      <title>Conditional Diffusion on Web-Scale Image Pairs leads to Diverse Image Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating image variations, where a model produces variations of an input image while preserving the semantic context has gained increasing attention. Current image variation techniques involve adapting a text-to-image model to reconstruct an input image conditioned on the same image. We first demonstrate that a diffusion model trained to reconstruct an input image from frozen embeddings, can reconstruct the image with minor variations. Second, inspired by how text-to-image models learn from web-scale text-image pairs, we explore a new pretraining strategy to generate image variations using a large collection of image pairs. Our diffusion model \textit{Semantica} receives a random (encoded) image from a webpage as conditional input and denoises another noisy random image from the same webpage. We carefully examine various design choices for the image encoder, given its crucial role in extracting relevant context from the input image. Once trained, \textit{Semantica} can adaptively generate new images from a dataset by simply using images from that dataset as input. Finally, we identify limitations in standard image consistency metrics for evaluating image variations and propose alternative metrics based on few-shot generation.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large.</description>

      <title>SEMF: Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework for Predicting Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic approach for generating prediction intervals in datasets with complete or missing data. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, leveraging latent variable modeling for uncertainty estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations across 11 tabular datasets show that SEMF often achieves narrower normalized prediction intervals and higher coverage rates than traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, SEMF can be integrated with machine learning models like gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, highlighting its practical applicability. The results indicate that SEMF enhances uncertainty quantification, particularly in scenarios with complete data.</description>

      <title>CASE: Efficient Curricular Data Pre-training for Building Assistive Psychology Expert Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of psychologists necessitates efficient identification of individuals requiring urgent mental healthcare. This study explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines to analyze text data from online mental health forums used for consultations. By analyzing forum posts, these pipelines can flag users who may require immediate professional attention. A crucial challenge in this domain is data privacy and scarcity. To address this, we propose utilizing readily available curricular texts used in institutes specializing in mental health for pre-training the NLP pipelines. This helps us mimic the training process of a psychologist. Our work presents CASE-BERT that flags potential mental health disorders based on forum text. CASE-BERT demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving an f1 score of 0.91 for Depression and 0.88 for Anxiety, two of the most commonly reported mental health disorders. Our code and data are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Bayesian WeakS-to-Strong from Text Classification to Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in large language models raise the question of how alignment techniques will adapt as models become increasingly complex and humans will only be able to supervise them weakly. Weak-to-Strong mimics such a scenario where weak model supervision attempts to harness the full capabilities of a much stronger model. This work extends Weak-to-Strong to WeakS-to-Strong by exploring an ensemble of weak models which simulate the variability in human opinions. Confidence scores are estimated using a Bayesian approach to guide the WeakS-to-Strong generalization. Furthermore, we extend the application of WeakS-to-Strong from text classification tasks to text generation tasks where more advanced strategies are investigated for supervision. Moreover, direct preference optimization is applied to advance the student model's preference learning, beyond the basic learning framework of teacher forcing. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the reliability of a strong student model, showing potential for superalignment.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b and Mistral-7b on four benchmark Q\&amp;A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of density regression through tree flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common objective in the analysis of tabular data is estimating the conditional distribution (in contrast to only producing predictions) of a set of "outcome" variables given a set of "covariates", which is sometimes referred to as the "density regression" problem. Beyond estimation on the conditional distribution, the generative ability of drawing synthetic samples from the learned conditional distribution is also desired as it further widens the range of applications. We propose a flow-based generative model tailored for the density regression task on tabular data. Our flow applies a sequence of tree-based piecewise-linear transforms on initial uniform noise to eventually generate samples from complex conditional densities of (univariate or multivariate) outcomes given the covariates and allows efficient analytical evaluation of the fitted conditional density on any point in the sample space. We introduce a training algorithm for fitting the tree-based transforms using a divide-and-conquer strategy that transforms maximum likelihood training of the tree-flow into training a collection of binary classifiers--one at each tree split--under cross-entropy loss. We assess the performance of our method under out-of-sample likelihood evaluation and compare it with a variety of state-of-the-art conditional density learners on a range of simulated and real benchmark tabular datasets. Our method consistently achieves comparable or superior performance at a fraction of the training and sampling budget. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method's generative ability through an application to generating synthetic longitudinal microbiome compositional data based on training our flow on a publicly available microbiome study.</description>

      <title>Urdu Dependency Parsing and Treebank Development: A Syntactic and Morphological Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parsing is the process of analyzing a sentence's syntactic structure by breaking it down into its grammatical components. and is critical for various linguistic applications. Urdu is a low-resource, free word-order language and exhibits complex morphology. Literature suggests that dependency parsing is well-suited for such languages. Our approach begins with a basic feature model encompassing word location, head word identification, and dependency relations, followed by a more advanced model integrating part-of-speech (POS) tags and morphological attributes (e.g., suffixes, gender). We manually annotated a corpus of news articles of varying complexity. Using Maltparser and the NivreEager algorithm, we achieved a best-labeled accuracy (LA) of 70% and an unlabeled attachment score (UAS) of 84%, demonstrating the feasibility of dependency parsing for Urdu.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated Large-scale Simulator for Transportation System Optimization Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence techniques, transportation system optimization is evolving from traditional methods relying on expert experience to simulation and learning-based decision and optimization methods. Learning-based optimization methods require extensive interactions with highly realistic microscopic traffic simulators. However, existing microscopic traffic simulators are inefficient in large-scale scenarios and thus fail to support the adoption of these methods in large-scale transportation system optimization scenarios. In addition, the optimization scenarios supported by existing simulators are limited, mainly focusing on the traffic signal control. To address these challenges, we propose the first open-source GPU-accelerated large-scale microscopic simulator for transportation system simulation and optimization. The simulator can iterate at 84.09Hz, which achieves 88.92 times computational acceleration in the large-scale scenario with 2,464,950 vehicles compared to the best baseline CityFlow. Besides, it achieves a more realistic average road speeds simulated on real datasets by adopting the IDM model as the car-following model and the randomized MOBIL model as the lane-changing model. Based on it, we implement a set of microscopic and macroscopic controllable objects and metrics provided by Python API to support typical transportation system optimization scenarios. We choose five representative scenarios and benchmark classical rule-based algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, and black-box optimization algorithms in four cities. These experiments effectively demonstrate the usability of the simulator for large-scale traffic system optimization. The code of the simulator is available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/moss. We build an open-registration web platform available at https://moss.fiblab.net to support no-code trials.</description>

      <title>Concept-skill Transferability-based Data Selection for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning, or supervised finetuning on extensive task-specific data, is necessary for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generalize well across a broad range of vision-language (VL) tasks. However, training on large VL datasets can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we introduce COINCIDE, an effective and scalable data selection technique that uses a small model as a reference model to select visual instruction tuning data for efficient finetuning of a target LVLM, focusing on diversity and transferability. Specifically, we cluster the training data using internal activations from a small model, which identifies VL concept-skill compositions needed by a target LVLM. We then sample data from these diverse clusters by considering their density and transferability, or the ability to transfer well to other concept-skill compositions. This approach ensures the diversity of these compositions, which is vital for LVLM generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COINCIDE achieves superior performance and data selection efficiency against 8 strong baselines on two distinct datasets: LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan. Using only 20% of the LLaVA-1.5 dataset, COINCIDE achieves performance comparable to the LVLM finetuned on the whole dataset, with 70% reduction of the wall-clock running time. On the Vision-Flan dataset, our method achieves superior results with only 16.7% of the training data.</description>

      <title>Attention Score is not All You Need for Token Importance Indicator in KV Cache Reduction: Value Also Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling the context size of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform various new tasks, e.g., book summarization. However, the memory cost of the Key and Value (KV) cache in attention significantly limits the practical applications of LLMs. Recent works have explored token pruning for KV cache reduction in LLMs, relying solely on attention scores as a token importance indicator. However, our investigation into value vector norms revealed a notably non-uniform pattern questioning their reliance only on attention scores. Inspired by this, we propose a new method: Value-Aware Token Pruning (VATP) which uses both attention scores and the $ \ell_{1} $ norm of value vectors to evaluate token importance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2-7B-chat and Vicuna-v1.5-7B across 16 LongBench tasks demonstrate that VATP outperforms attention-score-only baselines in over 12 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of incorporating value vector norms into token importance evaluation of LLMs.</description>

      <title>MMUTF: Multimodal Multimedia Event Argument Extraction with Unified Template Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advancement of multimedia technologies, news documents and user-generated content are often represented as multiple modalities, making Multimedia Event Extraction (MEE) an increasingly important challenge. However, recent MEE methods employ weak alignment strategies and data augmentation with simple classification models, which ignore the capabilities of natural language-formulated event templates for the challenging Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. In this work, we focus on EAE and address this issue by introducing a unified template filling model that connects the textual and visual modalities via textual prompts. This approach enables the exploitation of cross-ontology transfer and the incorporation of event-specific semantics. Experiments on the M2E2 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our system surpasses the current SOTA on textual EAE by +7% F1, and performs generally better than the second-best systems for multimedia EAE.</description>

      <title>An LLM Feature-based Framework for Dialogue Constructiveness Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on dialogue constructiveness assessment focuses on (i) analysing conversational factors that influence individuals to take specific actions, win debates, change their perspectives or broaden their open-mindedness and (ii) predicting constructiveness outcomes following dialogues for such use cases. These objectives can be achieved by training either interpretable feature-based models (which often involve costly human annotations) or neural models such as pre-trained language models (which have empirically shown higher task accuracy but lack interpretability). In this paper we propose an LLM feature-based framework for dialogue constructiveness assessment that combines the strengths of feature-based and neural approaches, while mitigating their downsides. The framework first defines a set of dataset-independent and interpretable linguistic features, which can be extracted by both prompting an LLM and simple heuristics. Such features are then used to train LLM feature-based models. We apply this framework to three datasets of dialogue constructiveness and find that our LLM feature-based models outperform or performs at least as well as standard feature-based models and neural models. We also find that the LLM feature-based model learns more robust prediction rules instead of relying on superficial shortcuts, which often trouble neural models.</description>

Abstract: When engaging in collaborative tasks, humans efficiently exploit the semantic structure of a conversation to optimize verbal and nonverbal interactions. But in recent "language to code" or "language to action" models, this information is lacking. We show how incorporating the prior discourse and nonlinguistic context of a conversation situated in a nonlinguistic environment can improve the "language to action" component of such interactions. We finetune an LLM to predict actions based on prior context; our model, Nebula, doubles the net-action F1 score over the baseline on this task of Jayannavar et al.(2020). We also investigate our model's ability to construct shapes and understand location descriptions using a synthetic dataset</description>

      <title>Off-policy Evaluation with Deeply-abstracted States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is crucial for assessing a target policy's impact offline before its deployment. However, achieving accurate OPE in large state spaces remains challenging. This paper studies state abstractions -- originally designed for policy learning -- in the context of OPE. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We define a set of irrelevance conditions central to learning state abstractions for OPE, and derive a backward-model-irrelevance condition for achieving irrelevance in %sequential and (marginalized) importance sampling ratios by constructing a time-reversed Markov decision process (MDP). (ii) We propose a novel iterative procedure that sequentially projects the original state space into a smaller space, resulting in a deeply-abstracted state, which substantially simplifies the sample complexity of OPE arising from high cardinality. (iii) We prove the Fisher consistencies of various OPE estimators when applied to our proposed abstract state spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how to subvert large language models (LLMs) from following prompt-specified rules. We model rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form ``if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$'' for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We prove that although LLMs can faithfully follow such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can mislead even idealized, theoretically constructed models. Empirically, we find that the reasoning behavior of LLMs aligns with that of our theoretical constructions, and popular attack algorithms find adversarial prompts with characteristics predicted by our theory. Our logic-based framework provides a novel perspective for mechanistically understanding the behavior of LLMs in rule-based settings such as jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01100</link>

Abstract: Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Based on the analyses, we propose to eliminate position bias (e.g., different retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a training-free zero-shot approach. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the document level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains, making Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set.</description>

      <title>Motion meets Attention: Video Motion Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Videos contain rich spatio-temporal information. Traditional methods for extracting motion, used in tasks such as action recognition, often rely on visual contents rather than precise motion features. This phenomenon is referred to as 'blind motion extraction' behavior, which proves inefficient in capturing motions of interest due to a lack of motion-guided cues. Recently, attention mechanisms have enhanced many computer vision tasks by effectively highlighting salient visual areas. Inspired by this, we propose a modified Sigmoid function with learnable slope and shift parameters as an attention mechanism to modulate motion signals from frame differencing maps. This approach generates a sequence of attention maps that enhance the processing of motion-related video content. To ensure temporal continuity and smoothness of the attention maps, we apply pair-wise temporal attention variation regularization to remove unwanted motions (e.g., noise) while preserving important ones. We then perform Hadamard product between each pair of attention maps and the original video frames to highlight the evolving motions of interest over time. These highlighted motions, termed video motion prompts, are subsequently used as inputs to the model instead of the original video frames. We formalize this process as a motion prompt layer and incorporate the regularization term into the loss function to learn better motion prompts. This layer serves as an adapter between the model and the video data, bridging the gap between traditional 'blind motion extraction' and the extraction of relevant motions of interest. We show that our lightweight, plug-and-play motion prompt layer seamlessly integrates into models like SlowFast, X3D, and TimeSformer, enhancing performance on benchmarks such as FineGym and MPII Cooking 2.</description>

      <title>GPT vs RETRO: Exploring the Intersection of Retrieval and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.</description>

      <title>Optimized Multi-Token Joint Decoding with Auxiliary Model for LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Affordance-Guided Reinforcement Learning via Visual Prompting</title>

Abstract: Robots equipped with reinforcement learning (RL) have the potential to learn a wide range of skills solely from a reward signal. However, obtaining a robust and dense reward signal for general manipulation tasks remains a challenge. Existing learning-based approaches require significant data, such as human demonstrations of success and failure, to learn task-specific reward functions. Recently, there is also a growing adoption of large multi-modal foundation models for robotics that can perform visual reasoning in physical contexts and generate coarse robot motions for manipulation tasks. Motivated by this range of capability, in this work, we present Keypoint-based Affordance Guidance for Improvements (KAGI), a method leveraging rewards shaped by vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous RL. State-of-the-art VLMs have demonstrated impressive reasoning about affordances through keypoints in zero-shot, and we use these to define dense rewards that guide autonomous robotic learning. On real-world manipulation tasks specified by natural language descriptions, KAGI improves the sample efficiency of autonomous RL and enables successful task completion in 20K online fine-tuning steps. Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of KAGI to reductions in the number of in-domain demonstrations used for pre-training, reaching similar performance in 35K online fine-tuning steps.

      <title>DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

      <title>Predictive Low Rank Matrix Learning under Partial Observations: Mixed-Projection ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ($k \leq 15$), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average $79\%$ lower objective value and $90.1\%$ lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the best performing benchmark method on synthetic data. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute. On large scale real world data, our algorithm produces solutions that achieve $67\%$ lower out of sample error than benchmark methods in $97\%$ less execution time.</description>

      <title>SharkTrack: an accurate, generalisable software for streamlining shark and ray underwater video analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elasmobranchs (shark sand rays) represent a critical component of marine ecosystems. Yet, they are experiencing global population declines and effective monitoring of populations is essential to their protection. Underwater stationary videos, such as those from Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS), are critical for understanding elasmobranch spatial ecology and abundance. However, processing these videos requires time-consuming manual analysis that can delay conservation. To address this challenge, we developed SharkTrack, a semi-automatic underwater video analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Object Tracking to automatically detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute species-specific MaxN (ssMaxN), the standard metric of relative abundance. When tested on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the CNN model during training, SharkTrack computed ssMaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, an estimated 95% reduction of manual analysis time compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack accuracy across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS, facilitating the analysis of any underwater stationary video. By making video analysis faster and more accessible, SharkTrack enables research and conservation organisations to monitor elasmobranch populations more efficiently, thereby improving conservation efforts. To further support these goals, we provide public access to the SharkTrack software.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction and Nearest Neighbors for Improving Out-of-Distribution Detection in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinically deployed deep learning-based segmentation models are known to fail on data outside of their training distributions. While clinicians review the segmentations, these models tend to perform well in most instances, which could exacerbate automation bias. Therefore, detecting out-of-distribution images at inference is critical to warn the clinicians that the model likely failed. This work applied the Mahalanobis distance (MD) post hoc to the bottleneck features of four Swin UNETR and nnU-net models that segmented the liver on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. By reducing the dimensions of the bottleneck features with either principal component analysis or uniform manifold approximation and projection, images the models failed on were detected with high performance and minimal computational load. In addition, this work explored a non-parametric alternative to the MD, a k-th nearest neighbors distance (KNN). KNN drastically improved scalability and performance over MD when both were applied to raw and average-pooled bottleneck features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control problems of complex physical systems have broad applications in science and engineering. Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the environment with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Optimal Stopping: A Singular Control Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores continuous-time and state-space optimal stopping problems from a reinforcement learning perspective. We begin by formulating the stopping problem using randomized stopping times, where the decision maker's control is represented by the probability of stopping within a given time--specifically, a bounded, non-decreasing, c\`adl\`ag control process. To encourage exploration and facilitate learning, we introduce a regularized version of the problem by penalizing it with the cumulative residual entropy of the randomized stopping time. The regularized problem takes the form of an (n+1)-dimensional degenerate singular stochastic control with finite-fuel. We address this through the dynamic programming principle, which enables us to identify the unique optimal exploratory strategy. For the specific case of a real option problem, we derive a semi-explicit solution to the regularized problem, allowing us to assess the impact of entropy regularization and analyze the vanishing entropy limit. Finally, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy iteration. We show both policy improvement and policy convergence results for our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Minimax Optimal Nonparametric In-Context Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) of large language models has proven to be a surprisingly effective method of learning a new task from only a few demonstrative examples. In this paper, we study the efficacy of ICL from the viewpoint of statistical learning theory. We develop approximation and generalization error bounds for a transformer composed of a deep neural network and one linear attention layer, pretrained on nonparametric regression tasks sampled from general function spaces including the Besov space and piecewise $\gamma$-smooth class. We show that sufficiently trained transformers can achieve -- and even improve upon -- the minimax optimal estimation risk in context by encoding the most relevant basis representations during pretraining. Our analysis extends to high-dimensional or sequential data and distinguishes the \emph{pretraining} and \emph{in-context} generalization gaps. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds for meta-learners w.r.t. both the number of tasks and in-context examples. These findings shed light on the roles of task diversity and representation learning for ICL.</description>

      <title>VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting visual models may offer a ``free lunch'' for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research.

      <title>Unleashing the Power of Task-Specific Directions in Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs)-critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

      <title>UI-JEPA: Towards Active Perception of User Intent through Onscreen User Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, "Intent in the Wild" (IIW) and "Intent in the Tame" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Preserving Relational Data Synthesis via Probabilistic Relational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic relational models provide a well-established formalism to combine first-order logic and probabilistic models, thereby allowing to represent relationships between objects in a relational domain. At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence requires increasingly large amounts of relational training data for various machine learning tasks. Collecting real-world data, however, is often challenging due to privacy concerns, data protection regulations, high costs, and so on. To mitigate these challenges, the generation of synthetic data is a promising approach. In this paper, we solve the problem of generating synthetic relational data via probabilistic relational models. In particular, we propose a fully-fledged pipeline to go from relational database to probabilistic relational model, which can then be used to sample new synthetic relational data points from its underlying probability distribution. As part of our proposed pipeline, we introduce a learning algorithm to construct a probabilistic relational model from a given relational database.</description>

      <title>OneGen: Efficient One-Pass Unified Generation and Retrieval for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.</description>

      <title>EEG-Language Modeling for Pathology Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language modeling constitutes a recent breakthrough which leverages advances in large language models to pretrain capable multimodal models. The integration of natural language during pretraining has been shown to significantly improve learned representations, particularly in computer vision. However, the efficacy of multimodal language modeling in the realm of functional brain data, specifically for advancing pathology detection, remains unexplored. This study pioneers EEG-language models trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We extend methods for multimodal alignment to this novel domain and investigate which textual information in reports is useful for training EEG-language models. Our results indicate that models learn richer representations from being exposed to a variety of report segments, including the patient's clinical history, description of the EEG, and the physician's interpretation. Compared to models exposed to narrower clinical text information, we find such models to retrieve EEGs based on clinical reports (and vice versa) with substantially higher accuracy. Yet, this is only observed when using a contrastive learning approach. Particularly in regimes with few annotations, we observe that representations of EEG-language models can significantly improve pathology detection compared to those of EEG-only models, as demonstrated by both zero-shot classification and linear probes. In sum, these results highlight the potential of integrating brain activity data with clinical text, suggesting that EEG-language models represent significant progress for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Video-LLMs: Toward Longer-sequence LMMs in a Training-free Manner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) inspire various strategies for integrating video modalities. A key approach is Video-LLMs, which incorporate an optimizable interface linking sophisticated video encoders to LLMs. However, due to computation and data limitations, these Video-LLMs are typically pre-trained to process only short videos, limiting their broader application for understanding longer video content. Additionally, fine-tuning Video-LLMs to handle longer videos is cost-prohibitive. Consequently, it becomes essential to explore the interpolation of Video-LLMs under a completely training-free setting. In this paper, we first identify the primary challenges in interpolating Video-LLMs: (1) the video encoder and modality alignment projector are fixed, preventing the integration of additional frames into Video-LLMs, and (2) the LLM backbone is limited in its content length capabilities, which complicates the processing of an increased number of video tokens. To address these challenges, we propose a specific INTerPolation method for Video-LLMs (INTP-Video-LLMs). We introduce an alternative video token rearrangement technique that circumvents limitations imposed by the fixed video encoder and alignment projector. Furthermore, we introduce a training-free LLM context window extension method to enable Video-LLMs to understand a correspondingly increased number of visual tokens.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</description>

      <title>Watch Your Steps: Observable and Modular Chains of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace Prompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power, generality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations are wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and names steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT explanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on the same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify "non-local errors" (which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Visibility and Temporal Dynamics: Revolutionizing Field of View Prediction in Adaptive Point Cloud Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</description>

      <title>Embodied-RAG: General Non-parametric Embodied Memory for Retrieval and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.
  To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.</description>

      <title>Learning from Demonstration with Implicit Nonlinear Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions, such as those encountered in robotic manipulation. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning a dynamical system model with convergence guarantees. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a recurrent neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties for modelling temporal dynamics. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Network (ESN) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</description>

      <title>Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data. Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free" nature of CFM training is preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.</description>

      <title>Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the fairness of task-adaptive pretraining on unlabeled test data before few-shot text classification</title>

Abstract: Few-shot learning benchmarks are critical for evaluating modern NLP techniques. It is possible, however, that benchmarks favor methods which easily make use of unlabeled text, because researchers can use unlabeled text from the test set to pretrain their models. Given the dearth of research on this potential problem, we run experiments to quantify the bias caused by pretraining on unlabeled test set text instead of on unlabeled, independently drawn text. Controlled few-shot and zero-shot experiments on 25 classification tasks and 3 language models -- BERT, GPT-2, and Mistral 7B -- do not find evidence of overoptimism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of repeated subsampling when studying few-shot text classification, and recommend that few-shot learning benchmarks include multiple training folds.

      <title>Integrating Text-to-Music Models with Language Models: Composing Long Structured Music Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent music generation methods based on transformers have a context window of up to a minute. The music generated by these methods are largely unstructured beyond the context window. With a longer context window, learning long scale structures from musical data is a prohibitively challenging problem. This paper proposes integrating a text-to-music model with a large language model to generate music with form. We discuss our solutions to the challenges of such integration. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate 2.5-minute-long music that is highly structured, strongly organized, and cohesive.</description>
