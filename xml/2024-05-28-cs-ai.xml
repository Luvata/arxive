      <title>Interpretable and Editable Programmatic Tree Policies for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are prone to goal misalignments. The black-box nature of their policies hinders the detection and correction of such misalignments, and the trust necessary for real-world deployment. So far, solutions learning interpretable policies are inefficient or require many human priors. We propose INTERPRETER, a fast distillation method producing INTerpretable Editable tRee Programs for ReinforcEmenT lEaRning. We empirically demonstrate that INTERPRETER compact tree programs match oracles across a diverse set of sequential decision tasks and evaluate the impact of our design choices on interpretability and performances. We show that our policies can be interpreted and edited to correct misalignments on Atari games and to explain real farming strategies.</description>

      <title>Creativity and Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity is already regularly attributed to AI systems outside specialised computational creativity (CC) communities. However, the evaluation of creativity in AI at large typically lacks grounding in creativity theory, which can promote inappropriate attributions and limit the analysis of creative behaviour. While CC researchers have translated psychological theory into formal models, the value of these models is limited by a gap to common AI frameworks. To mitigate this limitation, we identify formal mappings between Boden's process theory of creativity and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), using the Creative Systems Framework as a stepping stone. We study three out of eleven mappings in detail to understand which types of creative processes, opportunities for (aberrations), and threats to creativity (uninspiration) could be observed in an MDP. We conclude by discussing quality criteria for the selection of such mappings for future work and applications.</description>

      <title>MuDreamer: Learning Predictive World Models without Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DreamerV3 agent recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in diverse domains, learning powerful world models in latent space using a pixel reconstruction loss. However, while the reconstruction loss is essential to Dreamer's performance, it also necessitates modeling unnecessary information. Consequently, Dreamer sometimes fails to perceive crucial elements which are necessary for task-solving when visual distractions are present in the observation, significantly limiting its potential. In this paper, we present MuDreamer, a robust reinforcement learning agent that builds upon the DreamerV3 algorithm by learning a predictive world model without the need for reconstructing input signals. Rather than relying on pixel reconstruction, hidden representations are instead learned by predicting the environment value function and previously selected actions. Similar to predictive self-supervised methods for images, we find that the use of batch normalization is crucial to prevent learning collapse. We also study the effect of KL balancing between model posterior and prior losses on convergence speed and learning stability. We evaluate MuDreamer on the commonly used DeepMind Visual Control Suite and demonstrate stronger robustness to visual distractions compared to DreamerV3 and other reconstruction-free approaches, replacing the environment background with task-irrelevant real-world videos. Our method also achieves comparable performance on the Atari100k benchmark while benefiting from faster training.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of Faithful and Unfaithful Reasoning in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) improve their performance in downstream tasks when they generate Chain of Thought reasoning text before producing an answer. Our research investigates how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought, reaching the correct final answer despite mistakes in the reasoning text. Through analysis of these error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, but we also identify many clear examples of faithful error recovery behaviors. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. However, unfaithful recoveries show the opposite behavior, occurring more frequently for more difficult error positions. Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Our results challenge the view that LLM reasoning is a uniform, coherent process.</description>

      <title>CulturePark: Boosting Cross-cultural Understanding in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures. Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.</description>

      <title>Online Prompt Pricing based on Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit and Hierarchical Stackelberg Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation models have shown promising performance in various tasks, making trading around machine learning models possible. In this paper, we aim at a novel prompt trading scenario, prompt bundle trading (PBT) system, and propose an online pricing mechanism. Based on the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) and three-stage hierarchical Stackelburg (HS) game, our pricing mechanism considers the profits of the consumer, platform, and seller, simultaneously achieving the profit satisfaction of these three participants. We break down the pricing issue into two steps, namely unknown category selection and incentive strategy optimization. The former step is to select a set of categories with the highest qualities, and the latter is to derive the optimal strategy for each participant based on the chosen categories. Unlike the existing fixed pricing mode, the PBT pricing mechanism we propose is more flexible and diverse, which is more in accord with the transaction needs of real-world scenarios. We test our method on a simulated text-to-image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, which provides a feasible price-setting standard for the prompt marketplaces.</description>

      <title>$i$REPO: $i$mplicit Reward Pairwise Difference based Empirical Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While astonishingly capable, large Language Models (LLM) can sometimes produce outputs that deviate from human expectations. Such deviations necessitate an alignment phase to prevent disseminating untruthful, toxic, or biased information. Traditional alignment methods based on reinforcement learning often struggle with the identified instability, whereas preference optimization methods are limited by their overfitting to pre-collected hard-label datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM alignment framework named $i$REPO, which utilizes implicit Reward pairwise difference regression for Empirical Preference Optimization. Particularly, $i$REPO employs self-generated datasets labelled by empirical human (or AI annotator) preference to iteratively refine the aligned policy through a novel regression-based loss function. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative algorithm backed by theoretical guarantees for achieving optimal results under ideal assumptions and providing a practical performance-gap result without such assumptions. Experimental results with Phi-2 and Mistral-7B demonstrate that $i$REPO effectively achieves self-alignment using soft-label, self-generated responses and the logit of empirical AI annotators. Furthermore, our approach surpasses preference optimization baselines in evaluations using the Language Model Evaluation Harness and Multi-turn benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding How Transformer Perform Multi-step Reasoning with Matching Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have consistently struggled with complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving. Investigating the internal reasoning mechanisms of these models can help us design better model architectures and training strategies, ultimately enhancing their reasoning capabilities. In this study, we examine the matching mechanism employed by Transformer for multi-step reasoning on a constructed dataset. We investigate factors that influence the model's matching mechanism and discover that small initialization and post-LayerNorm can facilitate the formation of the matching mechanism, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability. Moreover, we propose a method to improve the model's reasoning capability by adding orthogonal noise. Finally, we investigate the parallel reasoning mechanism of Transformers and propose a conjecture on the upper bound of the model's reasoning ability based on this phenomenon. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the reasoning processes in large language models and guide designing more effective reasoning architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <title>V-Zen: Efficient GUI Understanding and Precise Grounding With A Novel Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI research and application, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative force, adept at interpreting and integrating information from diverse modalities such as text, images, and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Despite these advancements, the nuanced interaction and understanding of GUIs pose a significant challenge, limiting the potential of existing models to enhance automation levels. To bridge this gap, this paper presents V-Zen, an innovative Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) meticulously crafted to revolutionise the domain of GUI understanding and grounding. Equipped with dual-resolution image encoders, V-Zen establishes new benchmarks in efficient grounding and next-action prediction, thereby laying the groundwork for self-operating computer systems. Complementing V-Zen is the GUIDE dataset, an extensive collection of real-world GUI elements and task-based sequences, serving as a catalyst for specialised fine-tuning. The successful integration of V-Zen and GUIDE marks the dawn of a new era in multimodal AI research, opening the door to intelligent, autonomous computing experiences. This paper extends an invitation to the research community to join this exciting journey, shaping the future of GUI automation. In the spirit of open science, our code, data, and model will be made publicly available, paving the way for multimodal dialogue scenarios with intricate and precise interactions.</description>

      <title>A Planet Scale Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph Based On OpenStreetMap And H3 Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial data plays a central role in modeling our world, for which OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides a rich source of such data. While often spatial data is represented in a tabular format, a graph based representation provides the possibility to interconnect entities which would have been separated in a tabular representation. We propose in our paper a framework which supports a planet scale transformation of OpenStreetMap data into a Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph. In addition to OpenStreetMap data, we align the different OpenStreetMap geometries on individual h3 grid cells. We compare our constructed spatial knowledge graph to other spatial knowledge graphs and outline our contribution in this paper. As a basis for our computation, we use Apache Sedona as a computational framework for our Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph construction</description>

      <title>Generating Code World Models with Large Language Models Guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider Code World Models, world models generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of Python code for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Calling code instead of LLMs for planning has the advantages of being precise, reliable, interpretable, and extremely efficient. However, writing appropriate Code World Models requires the ability to understand complex instructions, to generate exact code with non-trivial logic and to self-debug a long program with feedback from unit tests and environment trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Generate, Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS), a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach, we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB), a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks, and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning, resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed.</description>

      <title>Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands. Our code is available at https://github.com/X1a-jk/InteractTraj.git</description>

      <title>Luban: Building Open-Ended Creative Agents via Autonomous Embodied Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building open agents has always been the ultimate goal in AI research, and creative agents are the more enticing. Existing LLM agents excel at long-horizon tasks with well-defined goals (e.g., `mine diamonds' in Minecraft). However, they encounter difficulties on creative tasks with open goals and abstract criteria due to the inability to bridge the gap between them, thus lacking feedback for self-improvement in solving the task. In this work, we introduce autonomous embodied verification techniques for agents to fill the gap, laying the groundwork for creative tasks. Specifically, we propose the Luban agent target creative building tasks in Minecraft, which equips with two-level autonomous embodied verification inspired by human design practices: (1) visual verification of 3D structural speculates, which comes from agent synthesized CAD modeling programs; (2) pragmatic verification of the creation by generating and verifying environment-relevant functionality programs based on the abstract criteria. Extensive multi-dimensional human studies and Elo ratings show that the Luban completes diverse creative building tasks in our proposed benchmark and outperforms other baselines ($33\%$ to $100\%$) in both visualization and pragmatism. Additional demos on the real-world robotic arm show the creation potential of the Luban in the physical world.</description>

      <title>Learning Beyond Pattern Matching? Assaying Mathematical Understanding in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are beginning to see progress in language model assisted scientific discovery. Motivated by the use of LLMs as a general scientific assistant, this paper assesses the domain knowledge of LLMs through its understanding of different mathematical skills required to solve problems. In particular, we look at not just what the pre-trained model already knows, but how it learned to learn from information during in-context learning or instruction-tuning through exploiting the complex knowledge structure within mathematics. Motivated by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we propose \textit{NTKEval} to assess changes in LLM's probability distribution via training on different kinds of math data. Our systematic analysis finds evidence of domain understanding during in-context learning. By contrast, certain instruction-tuning leads to similar performance changes irrespective of training on different data, suggesting a lack of domain understanding across different skills.</description>

      <title>OMNI-EPIC: Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness with Environments Programmed in Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-ended and AI-generating algorithms aim to continuously generate and solve increasingly complex tasks indefinitely, offering a promising path toward more general intelligence. To accomplish this grand vision, learning must occur within a vast array of potential tasks. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments are constrained within manually predefined, often narrow distributions of environment, limiting their ability to create any learning environment. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework, OMNI-EPIC, that augments previous work in Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI) with Environments Programmed in Code (EPIC). OMNI-EPIC leverages foundation models to autonomously generate code specifying the next learnable (i.e., not too easy or difficult for the agent's current skill set) and interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel) tasks. OMNI-EPIC generates both environments (e.g., an obstacle course) and reward functions (e.g., progress through the obstacle course quickly without touching red objects), enabling it, in principle, to create any simulatable learning task. We showcase the explosive creativity of OMNI-EPIC, which continuously innovates to suggest new, interesting learning challenges. We also highlight how OMNI-EPIC can adapt to reinforcement learning agents' learning progress, generating tasks that are of suitable difficulty. Overall, OMNI-EPIC can endlessly create learnable and interesting environments, further propelling the development of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms.

      <title>Randomized heuristic repair for large-scale multidimensional knapsack problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution is determining a subset of maximum total profit items that do not violate capacity constraints. Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic dreaming: A pathway to efficient learning in artificial agents</title>

Abstract: Achieving energy efficiency in learning is a key challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) computing platforms. Biological systems demonstrate remarkable abilities to learn complex skills quickly and efficiently. Inspired by this, we present a hardware implementation of model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) using spiking neural networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic hardware. This approach leverages the energy efficiency of mixed-signal neuromorphic chips while achieving high sample efficiency through an alternation of online learning, referred to as the "awake" phase, and offline learning, known as the "dreaming" phase. The model proposed includes two symbiotic networks: an agent network that learns by combining real and simulated experiences, and a learned world model network that generates the simulated experiences. We validate the model by training the hardware implementation to play the Atari game Pong. We start from a baseline consisting of an agent network learning without a world model and dreaming, which successfully learns to play the game. By incorporating dreaming, the number of required real game experiences are reduced significantly compared to the baseline. The networks are implemented using a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor, with the readout layers trained using a computer in-the-loop, while the other layers remain fixed. These results pave the way toward energy-efficient neuromorphic learning systems capable of rapid learning in real world applications and use-cases.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adverse Drug Event Detection with Multimodal Dataset: Corpus Creation and Model Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mining of adverse drug events (ADEs) is pivotal in pharmacovigilance, enhancing patient safety by identifying potential risks associated with medications, facilitating early detection of adverse events, and guiding regulatory decision-making. Traditional ADE detection methods are reliable but slow, not easily adaptable to large-scale operations, and offer limited information. With the exponential increase in data sources like social media content, biomedical literature, and Electronic Medical Records (EMR), extracting relevant ADE-related information from these unstructured texts is imperative. Previous ADE mining studies have focused on text-based methodologies, overlooking visual cues, limiting contextual comprehension, and hindering accurate interpretation. To address this gap, we present a MultiModal Adverse Drug Event (MMADE) detection dataset, merging ADE-related textual information with visual aids. Additionally, we introduce a framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs for ADE detection by generating detailed descriptions of medical images depicting ADEs, aiding healthcare professionals in visually identifying adverse events. Using our MMADE dataset, we showcase the significance of integrating visual cues from images to enhance overall performance. This approach holds promise for patient safety, ADE awareness, and healthcare accessibility, paving the way for further exploration in personalized healthcare.</description>

      <title>Zero Shot Context-Based Object Segmentation using SLIP (SAM+CLIP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SLIP (SAM+CLIP), an enhanced architecture for zero-shot object segmentation. SLIP combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \cite{kirillov2023segment} with the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) \cite{radford2021learning}. By incorporating text prompts into SAM using CLIP, SLIP enables object segmentation without prior training on specific classes or categories. We fine-tune CLIP on a Pokemon dataset, allowing it to learn meaningful image-text representations. SLIP demonstrates the ability to recognize and segment objects in images based on contextual information from text prompts, expanding the capabilities of SAM for versatile object segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLIP architecture in segmenting objects in images based on textual cues. The integration of CLIP's text-image understanding capabilities into SAM expands the capabilities of the original architecture and enables more versatile and context-aware object segmentation.</description>

      <title>BloodCell-Net: A lightweight convolutional neural network for the classification of all microscopic blood cell images of the human body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood cell classification and counting are vital for the diagnosis of various blood-related diseases, such as anemia, leukemia, and thrombocytopenia. The manual process of blood cell classification and counting is time-consuming, prone to errors, and labor-intensive. Therefore, we have proposed a DL based automated system for blood cell classification and counting from microscopic blood smear images. We classify total of nine types of blood cells, including Erythrocyte, Erythroblast, Neutrophil, Basophil, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Monocyte, Immature Granulocytes, and Platelet. Several preprocessing steps like image resizing, rescaling, contrast enhancement and augmentation are utilized. To segment the blood cells from the entire microscopic images, we employed the U-Net model. This segmentation technique aids in extracting the region of interest (ROI) by removing complex and noisy background elements. Both pixel-level metrics such as accuracy, precision, and sensitivity, and object-level evaluation metrics like Intersection over Union (IOU) and Dice coefficient are considered to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the U-Net model. The segmentation model achieved impressive performance metrics, including 98.23% accuracy, 98.40% precision, 98.25% sensitivity, 95.97% Intersection over Union (IOU), and 97.92% Dice coefficient. Subsequently, a watershed algorithm is applied to the segmented images to separate overlapped blood cells and extract individual cells. We have proposed a BloodCell-Net approach incorporated with custom light weight convolutional neural network (LWCNN) for classifying individual blood cells into nine types. Comprehensive evaluation of the classifier's performance is conducted using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The classifier achieved an average accuracy of 97.10%, precision of 97.19%, recall of 97.01%, and F1 score of 97.10%.</description>

      <title>Precise and Robust Sidewalk Detection: Leveraging Ensemble Learning to Surpass LLM Limitations in Urban Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a robust ensemble model with the state-of-the-art ONE-PEACE Large Language Model (LLM) for accurate detection of sidewalks. Accurate sidewalk detection is crucial in improving road safety and urban planning. The study evaluated the model's performance on Cityscapes, Ade20k, and the Boston Dataset. The results showed that the ensemble model performed better than the individual models, achieving mean Intersection Over Union (mIOU) scores of 93.1\%, 90.3\%, and 90.6\% on these datasets under ideal conditions. Additionally, the ensemble model maintained a consistent level of performance even in challenging conditions such as Salt-and-Pepper and Speckle noise, with only a gradual decrease in efficiency observed. On the other hand, the ONE-PEACE LLM performed slightly better than the ensemble model in ideal scenarios but experienced a significant decline in performance under noisy conditions. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the ensemble model, making it a valuable asset for improving urban infrastructure related to road safety and curb space management. This study contributes positively to the broader context of urban health and mobility.</description>

      <title>Automatic Coral Detection with YOLO: A Deep Learning Approach for Efficient and Accurate Coral Reef Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that are under increasing threat due to local human impacts and climate change. Efficient and accurate monitoring of coral reefs is crucial for their conservation and management. In this paper, we present an automatic coral detection system utilizing the You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning model, which is specifically tailored for underwater imagery analysis. To train and evaluate our system, we employ a dataset consisting of 400 original underwater images. We increased the number of annotated images to 580 through image manipulation using data augmentation techniques, which can improve the model's performance by providing more diverse examples for training. The dataset is carefully collected from underwater videos that capture various coral reef environments, species, and lighting conditions. Our system leverages the YOLOv5 algorithm's real-time object detection capabilities, enabling efficient and accurate coral detection. We used YOLOv5 to extract discriminating features from the annotated dataset, enabling the system to generalize, including previously unseen underwater images. The successful implementation of the automatic coral detection system with YOLOv5 on our original image dataset highlights the potential of advanced computer vision techniques for coral reef research and conservation. Further research will focus on refining the algorithm to handle challenging underwater image conditions, and expanding the dataset to incorporate a wider range of coral species and spatio-temporal variations.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Query-Key Interaction in Vision Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention in vision transformers has been thought to perform perceptual grouping where tokens attend to other tokens with similar embeddings, which could correspond to semantically similar features in an image. However, contextualization is also an important and necessary computation for processing signals. Contextualization potentially requires tokens to attend to dissimilar tokens such as those corresponding to backgrounds or different objects, but this effect has not been reported in previous studies. In this study, we investigate whether self-attention in vision transformers exhibits a preference for attending to similar tokens or dissimilar tokens, providing evidence of perceptual grouping and contextualization, respectively. To study this question, we propose the use of singular value decomposition on the query-key matrix ${\textbf{W}_q}^T\textbf{W}_k$. Naturally, the left and right singular vectors are feature directions of the self-attention layer and can be analyzed in pairs to interpret the interaction between tokens. We find that early layers attend more to similar tokens, while late layers show increased attention to dissimilar tokens. Moreover, many of these interactions between features represented by singular vectors are interpretable. We present a novel perspective on interpreting the attention mechanism, which may contribute to understanding how transformer models utilize context and salient features when processing images.</description>

      <title>DETAIL: Task DEmonsTration Attribution for Interpretable In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on general text to quickly learn a specific task with a few "task demonstrations" without updating their parameters, significantly boosting their flexibility and generality. ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel framework to explore neural control and design of complex fluidic systems with dynamic solid boundaries. Our system features a fast differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with solid-fluid interface handling, a low-dimensional differentiable parametric geometry representation, a control-shape co-design algorithm, and gym-like simulation environments to facilitate various fluidic control design applications. Additionally, we present a benchmark of design, control, and learning tasks on high-fidelity, high-resolution dynamic fluid environments that pose challenges for existing differentiable fluid simulators. These tasks include designing the control of artificial hearts, identifying robotic end-effector shapes, and controlling a fluid gate. By seamlessly incorporating our differentiable fluid simulator into a learning framework, we demonstrate successful design, control, and learning results that surpass gradient-free solutions in these benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Structural Entities Extraction and Patient Indications Incorporation for Chest X-ray Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The automated generation of imaging reports proves invaluable in alleviating the workload of radiologists. A clinically applicable reports generation algorithm should demonstrate its effectiveness in producing reports that accurately describe radiology findings and attend to patient-specific indications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, \textbf{S}tructural \textbf{E}ntities extraction and patient indications \textbf{I}ncorporation (SEI) for chest X-ray report generation. Specifically, we employ a structural entities extraction (SEE) approach to eliminate presentation-style vocabulary in reports and improve the quality of factual entity sequences. This reduces the noise in the following cross-modal alignment module by aligning X-ray images with factual entity sequences in reports, thereby enhancing the precision of cross-modal alignment and further aiding the model in gradient-free retrieval of similar historical cases. Subsequently, we propose a cross-modal fusion network to integrate information from X-ray images, similar historical cases, and patient-specific indications. This process allows the text decoder to attend to discriminative features of X-ray images, assimilate historical diagnostic information from similar cases, and understand the examination intention of patients. This, in turn, assists in triggering the text decoder to produce high-quality reports. Experiments conducted on MIMIC-CXR validate the superiority of SEI over state-of-the-art approaches on both natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutoCoder, the first Large Language Model to surpass GPT-4 Turbo (April 2024) and GPT-4o in pass@1 on the Human Eval benchmark test ($\mathbf{90.9\%}$ vs. $\mathbf{90.2\%}$). In addition, AutoCoder offers a more versatile code interpreter compared to GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o. It's code interpreter can install external packages instead of limiting to built-in packages. AutoCoder's training data is a multi-turn dialogue dataset created by a system combining agent interaction and external code execution verification, a method we term \textbf{\textsc{AIEV-Instruct}} (Instruction Tuning with Agent-Interaction and Execution-Verified). Compared to previous large-scale code dataset generation methods, \textsc{AIEV-Instruct} reduces dependence on proprietary large models and provides execution-validated code dataset. The code and the demo video is available in \url{https://github.com/bin123apple/AutoCoder}.</description>

      <title>Data Mixing Made Efficient: A Bivariate Scaling Law for Language Model Pretraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities, primarily attributed to the utilization of diversely sourced data. However, conventional practices in integrating this diverse data heavily rely on heuristic schemes, lacking theoretical guidance. This research tackles these limitations by investigating strategies based on low-cost proxies for data mixtures, with the aim of streamlining data curation to enhance training efficiency. Specifically, we propose a unified scaling law, termed BiMix, which accurately models the bivariate scaling behaviors of both data quantity and mixing proportions. We conduct systematic experiments and provide empirical evidence for the predictive power and fundamental principles of BiMix. Notably, our findings reveal that entropy-driven training-free data mixtures can achieve comparable or even better performance than more resource-intensive methods. We hope that our quantitative insights can shed light on further judicious research and development in cost-effective language modeling.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Price Bounds Estimation with Shape Constraints in Price Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the interpretable estimation of price bounds within the context of price optimization. In recent years, price optimization methods have become indispensable for maximizing revenues and profits. However, effectively applying these methods to real-world pricing operations remains a significant challenge. It is crucial for operators, who are responsible for setting prices, to utilize reasonable price bounds that are not only interpretable but also acceptable. Despite this necessity, most studies assume that price bounds are given constant values, and few have explored the reasonable determination of these bounds. In response, we propose a comprehensive framework for determining price bounds, which includes both the estimation and adjustment of these bounds. Specifically, we first estimate the price bounds using three distinct approaches based on historical pricing data. We then adjust the estimated price bounds by solving an optimization problem that incorporates shape constraints. This method allows for the implementation of price optimization under practical and reasonable price bounds, suitable for real-world applications. We report the effectiveness of our proposed method through numerical experiments conducted with historical pricing data from actual services.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of ligands that both are tailored to a given protein pocket and exhibit a range of desired chemical properties is a major challenge in structure-based drug design. Here, we propose an in-silico approach for the $\textit{de novo}$ generation of 3D ligand structures using the equivariant diffusion model PILOT, combining pocket conditioning with a large-scale pre-training and property guidance. Its multi-objective trajectory-based importance sampling strategy is designed to direct the model towards molecules that not only exhibit desired characteristics such as increased binding affinity for a given protein pocket but also maintains high synthetic accessibility. This ensures the practicality of sampled molecules, thus maximizing their potential for the drug discovery pipeline. PILOT significantly outperforms existing methods across various metrics on the common benchmark dataset CrossDocked2020. Moreover, we employ PILOT to generate novel ligands for unseen protein pockets from the Kinodata-3D dataset, which encompasses a substantial portion of the human kinome. The generated structures exhibit predicted $IC_{50}$ values indicative of potent biological activity, which highlights the potential of PILOT as a powerful tool for structure-based drug design.</description>

      <title>Mallows-DPO: Fine-Tune Your LLM with Preference Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the Mallows-DPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with Mallows-DPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Understanding the dynamics of the frequency bias in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that traditional Neural Network (NN) architectures display a marked frequency bias in the learning process. Namely, the NN first learns the low-frequency features before learning the high-frequency ones. In this study, we rigorously develop a partial differential equation (PDE) that unravels the frequency dynamics of the error for a 2-layer NN in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime. Furthermore, using this insight, we explicitly demonstrate how an appropriate choice of distributions for the initialization weights can eliminate or control the frequency bias. We focus our study on the Fourier Features model, an NN where the first layer has sine and cosine activation functions, with frequencies sampled from a prescribed distribution. In this setup, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and compare the NN dynamics to the solution of the PDE using the finite element method. Finally, we empirically show that the same principle extends to multi-layer NNs.</description>

      <title>EvGGS: A Collaborative Learning Framework for Event-based Generalizable Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.</description>

      <title>LOVA3: Learning to Visual Question Answering, Asking and Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Question answering, asking, and assessment are three innate human traits crucial for understanding the world and acquiring knowledge. By enhancing these capabilities, humans can more effectively utilize data, leading to better comprehension and learning outcomes. However, current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) primarily focus on question answering, often neglecting the full potential of questioning and assessment skills. In this study, we introduce LOVA3, an innovative framework named ``Learning tO Visual Question Answering, Asking and Assessment,'' designed to equip MLLMs with these additional capabilities. Our approach involves the creation of two supplementary training tasks GenQA and EvalQA, aiming at fostering the skills of asking and assessing questions in the context of images. To develop the questioning ability, we compile a comprehensive set of multimodal foundational tasks. For assessment, we introduce a new benchmark called EvalQABench, comprising 64,000 training samples (split evenly between positive and negative samples) and 5,000 testing samples. We posit that enhancing MLLMs with the capabilities to answer, ask, and assess questions will improve their multimodal comprehension and lead to better performance. We validate our hypothesis by training an MLLM using the LOVA3 framework and testing it on 10 multimodal benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, thereby confirming the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate in-context learning ability to perform various functions based solely on the provided context, without updating model parameters. To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</description>

Abstract: We show that the greedy algorithm for adaptive-submodular cover has approximation ratio at least 1.3*(1+ln Q). Moreover, the instance demonstrating this gap has Q=1. So, it invalidates a prior result in the paper ``Adaptive Submodularity: A New Approach to Active Learning and Stochastic Optimization'' by Golovin-Krause, that claimed a (1+ln Q)^2 approximation ratio for the same algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We introduce RE-Adapt, an approach to fine-tuning large language models on new domains without degrading any pre-existing instruction-tuning. We reverse engineer an adapter which isolates what an instruction-tuned model has learned beyond its corresponding pretrained base model. Importantly, this requires no additional data or training. We can then fine-tune the base model on a new domain and readapt it to instruction following with the reverse engineered adapter. RE-Adapt and our low-rank variant LoRE-Adapt both outperform other methods of fine-tuning, across multiple popular LLMs and datasets, even when the models are used in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation.</description>

      <title>What Variables Affect Out-Of-Distribution Generalization in Pretrained Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embeddings produced by pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used; however, their efficacy for downstream tasks can vary widely. We study the factors influencing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of pre-trained DNN embeddings through the lens of the tunnel effect hypothesis, which suggests deeper DNN layers compress representations and hinder OOD performance. Contrary to earlier work, we find the tunnel effect is not universal. Based on 10,584 linear probes, we study the conditions that mitigate the tunnel effect by varying DNN architecture, training dataset, image resolution, and augmentations. We quantify each variable's impact using a novel SHAP analysis. Our results emphasize the danger of generalizing findings from toy datasets to broader contexts.</description>

Abstract: Language-conditioned robotic skills make it possible to apply the high-level reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to low-level robotic control. A remaining challenge is to acquire a diverse set of fundamental skills. Existing approaches either manually decompose a complex task into atomic robotic actions in a top-down fashion, or bootstrap as many combinations as possible in a bottom-up fashion to cover a wider range of task possibilities. These decompositions or combinations, however, require an initial skill library. For example, a "grasping" capability can never emerge from a skill library containing only diverse "pushing" skills. Existing skill discovery techniques with reinforcement learning acquire skills by an exhaustive exploration but often yield non-meaningful behaviors. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for skill discovery that is entirely driven by LLMs. The framework begins with an LLM generating task proposals based on the provided scene description and the robot's configurations, aiming to incrementally acquire new skills upon task completion. For each proposed task, a series of reinforcement learning processes are initiated, utilizing reward and success determination functions sampled by the LLM to develop the corresponding policy. The reliability and trustworthiness of learned behaviors are further ensured by an independent vision-language model. We show that starting with zero skill, the ASD skill library emerges and expands to more and more meaningful and reliable skills, enabling the robot to efficiently further propose and complete advanced tasks.

      <title>AdjointDEIS: Efficient Gradients for Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the latents and parameters of diffusion models with respect to some differentiable metric defined on the output of the model is a challenging and complex problem. The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function or related quantity, allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, na\"ive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel method based on the stochastic adjoint sensitivity method to calculate the gradientwith respect to the initial noise, conditional information, and model parameters by solving an additional SDE whose solution is the gradient of the diffusion SDE. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the adjoint diffusion SDE and use a change-of-variables to simplify the solution to an exponentially weighted integral. Using this formulation we derive a custom solver for the adjoint SDE as well as the simpler adjoint ODE. The proposed adjoint diffusion solvers can efficiently compute the gradients for both the probability flow ODE and diffusion SDE for latents and parameters of the model. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the adjoint diffusion solvers onthe face morphing problem.</description>

      <title>Generating camera failures as a class of physics-based adversarial examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been extensive work on generating physics-based adversarial samples recently, an overlooked class of such samples come from physical failures in the camera. Camera failures can occur as a result of an external physical process, i.e. breakdown of a component due to stress, or an internal component failure. In this work, we develop a simulated physical process for generating broken lens as a class of physics-based adversarial samples. We create a stress-based physical simulation by generating particles constrained in a mesh and apply stress at a random point and at a random angle. We perform stress propagation through the mesh and the end result of the mesh is a corresponding image which simulates the broken lens pattern. We also develop a neural emulator which learns the non-linear mapping between the mesh as a graph and the stress propagation using constrained propagation setup. We can then statistically compare the difference between the generated adversarial samples with real, simulated and emulated adversarial examples using the detection failure rate of the different classes and in between the samples using the Frechet Inception distance. Our goal through this work is to provide a robust physics based process for generating adversarial samples.</description>

      <title>Credal Wrapper of Model Averaging for Uncertainty Estimation on Out-Of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative approach, called credal wrapper, to formulating a credal set representation of model averaging for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles, capable of improving uncertainty estimation in classification tasks. Given a finite collection of single distributions derived from BNNs or deep ensembles, the proposed approach extracts an upper and a lower probability bound per class, acknowledging the epistemic uncertainty due to the availability of a limited amount of sampled predictive distributions. Such probability intervals over classes can be mapped on a convex set of probabilities (a 'credal set') from which, in turn, a unique prediction can be obtained using a transformation called 'intersection probability transformation'. In this article, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks, encompassing various dataset pairs (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100 vs CIFAR100-C and ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (such as VGG16, Res18/50, EfficientNet B2, and ViT Base). Compared to BNN and deep ensemble baselines, the proposed credal representation methodology exhibits superior performance in uncertainty estimation and achieves lower expected calibration error on OOD samples.</description>

      <title>Revisiting MoE and Dense Speed-Accuracy Comparisons for LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enjoys performance gain by increasing model capacity while keeping computation cost constant. When comparing MoE to dense models, prior work typically adopt the following setting: 1) use FLOPs or activated parameters as a measure of model complexity; 2) train all models to the same number of tokens. We argue that this setting favors MoE as FLOPs and activated parameters do not accurately measure the communication overhead in sparse layers, leading to a larger actual training budget for MoE. In this work, we revisit the settings by adopting step time as a more accurate measure of model complexity, and by determining the total compute budget under the Chinchilla compute-optimal settings. To efficiently run MoE on modern accelerators, we adopt a 3D sharding method that keeps the dense-to-MoE step time increase within a healthy range. We evaluate MoE and dense LLMs on a set of nine 0-shot and two 1-shot English tasks, as well as MMLU 5-shot and GSM8K 8-shot across three model scales at 6.4B, 12.6B, and 29.6B. Experimental results show that even under these settings, MoE consistently outperform dense LLMs on the speed-accuracy trade-off curve with meaningful gaps. Our full model implementation and sharding strategy will be released at~\url{https://github.com/apple/axlearn}</description>

      <title>Controlling Behavioral Diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of behavioral diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a nascent yet promising field. In this context, the present work deals with the question of how to control the diversity of a multi-agent system. With no existing approaches to control diversity to a set value, current solutions focus on blindly promoting it via intrinsic rewards or additional loss functions, effectively changing the learning objective and lacking a principled measure for it. To address this, we introduce Diversity Control (DiCo), a method able to control diversity to an exact value of a given metric by representing policies as the sum of a parameter-shared component and dynamically scaled per-agent components. By applying constraints directly to the policy architecture, DiCo leaves the learning objective unchanged, enabling its applicability to any actor-critic MARL algorithm. We theoretically prove that DiCo achieves the desired diversity, and we provide several experiments, both in cooperative and competitive tasks, that show how DiCo can be employed as a novel paradigm to increase performance and sample efficiency in MARL. Multimedia results are available on the paper's website: https://sites.google.com/view/dico-marl.</description>

      <title>Reframing Spatial Reasoning Evaluation in Language Models: A Real-World Simulation Benchmark for Qualitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning plays a vital role in both human cognition and machine intelligence, prompting new research into language models' (LMs) capabilities in this regard. However, existing benchmarks reveal shortcomings in evaluating qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). These benchmarks typically present oversimplified scenarios or unclear natural language descriptions, hindering effective evaluation. We present a novel benchmark for assessing QSR in LMs, which is grounded in realistic 3D simulation data, offering a series of diverse room layouts with various objects and their spatial relationships. This approach provides a more detailed and context-rich narrative for spatial reasoning evaluation, diverging from traditional, toy-task-oriented scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of qualitative spatial relationships, including topological, directional, and distance relations. These are presented with different viewing points, varied granularities, and density of relation constraints to mimic real-world complexities. A key contribution is our logic-based consistency-checking tool, which enables the assessment of multiple plausible solutions, aligning with real-world scenarios where spatial relationships are often open to interpretation. Our benchmark evaluation of advanced LMs reveals their strengths and limitations in spatial reasoning. They face difficulties with multi-hop spatial reasoning and interpreting a mix of different view descriptions, pointing to areas for future improvement.</description>

      <title>Temporal Stamp Classifier: Classifying Short Sequences of Astronomical Alerts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep learning-based classification model of astronomical objects using alerts reported by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Peer prediction mechanisms motivate high-quality feedback with provable guarantees. However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media.
  We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</description>

      <title>Contrastive and Consistency Learning for Neural Noisy-Channel Model in Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep end-to-end learning has been studied for intent classification in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). However, end-to-end models require a large amount of speech data with intent labels, and highly optimized models are generally sensitive to the inconsistency between the training and evaluation conditions. Therefore, a natural language understanding approach based on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) remains attractive because it can utilize a pre-trained general language model and adapt to the mismatch of the speech input environment. Using this module-based approach, we improve a noisy-channel model to handle transcription inconsistencies caused by ASR errors. We propose a two-stage method, Contrastive and Consistency Learning (CCL), that correlates error patterns between clean and noisy ASR transcripts and emphasizes the consistency of the latent features of the two transcripts. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that CCL outperforms existing methods and improves the ASR robustness in various noisy environments. Code is available at https://github.com/syoung7388/CCL.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Gain in Weak-to-Strong Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have shown capabilities that are extraordinary and near-superhuman. These models operate with such complexity that reliably evaluating and aligning them proves challenging for humans. This leads to the natural question: can guidance from weak models (like humans) adequately direct the capabilities of strong models? In a recent and somewhat surprising work, Burns et al. (2023) empirically demonstrated that when strong models (like GPT-4) are finetuned using labels generated by weak supervisors (like GPT-2), the strong models outperform their weaker counterparts -- a phenomenon they term weak-to-strong generalization.
  In this work, we present a theoretical framework for understanding weak-to-strong generalization. Specifically, we show that the improvement in performance achieved by strong models over their weaker counterparts is quantified by the misfit error incurred by the strong model on labels generated by the weaker model. Our theory reveals several curious algorithmic insights. For instance, we can predict the amount by which the strong model will improve over the weak model, and also choose among different weak models to train the strong model, based on its misfit error. We validate our theoretical findings through various empirical assessments.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer for the classification of colon biopsies and polyps in histopathology images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks with high-quality pixel-level annotation in histopathology whole-slide images (WSI) is an expensive process due to gigapixel resolution of WSIs. However, recent advances in self-supervised learning have shown that highly descriptive image representations can be learned without the need for annotations. We investigate the application of the recent Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT) model for the specific task of classification of colorectal biopsies and polyps. After evaluating the effectiveness of TCGA-learned features in the original HIPT model, we incorporate colon biopsy image information into HIPT's pretraining using two distinct strategies: (1) fine-tuning HIPT from the existing TCGA weights and (2) pretraining HIPT from random weight initialization. We compare the performance of these pretraining regimes on two colorectal biopsy classification tasks: binary and multiclass classification.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Dynamic Programming Framework for Occlusion-Robust Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider data association problems involving multi-object tracking (MOT). In particular, we address the challenges arising from object occlusions. We propose a framework called approximate dynamic programming track (ADPTrack), which applies dynamic programming principles to improve an existing method called the base heuristic. Given a set of tracks and the next target frame, the base heuristic extends the tracks by matching them to the objects of this target frame directly. In contrast, ADPTrack first processes a few subsequent frames and applies the base heuristic starting from the next target frame to obtain tentative tracks. It then leverages the tentative tracks to match the objects of the target frame. This tends to reduce the occlusion-based errors and leads to an improvement over the base heuristic. When tested on the MOT17 video dataset, the proposed method demonstrates a 0.7% improvement in the association accuracy (IDF1 metric) over a state-of-the-art method that is used as the base heuristic. It also obtains improvements with respect to all the other standard metrics. Empirically, we found that the improvements are particularly pronounced in scenarios where the video data is obtained by fixed-position cameras.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Go-Explore: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems, built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning, a novel area within artificial intelligence, focuses on addressing the challenge of selectively forgetting or reducing undesirable knowledge or behaviors in machine learning models, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces a methodology to align LLMs, such as Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models, with ethical, privacy, and safety standards by leveraging the gradient ascent algorithm for knowledge unlearning. Our approach aims to selectively erase or modify learned information in LLMs, targeting harmful responses and copyrighted content. This paper presents a dual-pronged approach to enhance the ethical and safe behavior of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the issues of harmful responses and copyrighted content. To mitigate harmful responses, we applied gradient ascent on the PKU dataset, achieving a 75\% reduction in harmful responses for Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models (OPT1.3b and OPT2.7b) \citet{zhang2022opt} while retaining previous knowledge using the TruthfulQA dataset \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2109-07958}. For handling copyrighted content, we constructed a custom dataset based on the Lord of the Rings corpus and aligned LLMs (OPT1.3b and OPT2.7b) \citet{zhang2022opt} through LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-09685} finetuning. Subsequently, we employed gradient ascent to unlearn the Lord of the Rings content, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the presence of copyrighted material. To maintain a diverse knowledge base, we utilized the Book Corpus dataset. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation technique for assessing the effectiveness of harmful unlearning.</description>

      <title>From Frege to chatGPT: Compositionality in language, cognition, and deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compositionality has long been considered a key explanatory property underlying human intelligence: arbitrary concepts can be composed into novel complex combinations, permitting the acquisition of an open ended, potentially infinite expressive capacity from finite learning experiences. Influential arguments have held that neural networks fail to explain this aspect of behavior, leading many to dismiss them as viable models of human cognition. Over the last decade, however, modern deep neural networks (DNNs), which share the same fundamental design principles as their predecessors, have come to dominate artificial intelligence, exhibiting the most advanced cognitive behaviors ever demonstrated in machines. In particular, large language models (LLMs), DNNs trained to predict the next word on a large corpus of text, have proven capable of sophisticated behaviors such as writing syntactically complex sentences without grammatical errors, producing cogent chains of reasoning, and even writing original computer programs -- all behaviors thought to require compositional processing. In this chapter, we survey recent empirical work from machine learning for a broad audience in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, situating recent breakthroughs within the broader context of philosophical arguments about compositionality. In particular, our review emphasizes two approaches to endowing neural networks with compositional generalization capabilities: (1) architectural inductive biases, and (2) metalearning, or learning to learn. We also present findings suggesting that LLM pretraining can be understood as a kind of metalearning, and can thereby equip DNNs with compositional generalization abilities in a similar way. We conclude by discussing the implications that these findings may have for the study of compositionality in human cognition and by suggesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>A Solution-based LLM API-using Methodology for Academic Information Seeking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying large language models (LLMs) for academic API usage shows promise in reducing researchers' academic information seeking efforts. However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning.
  To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines. All datasets, codes, tuned models, and deployed online services are publicly accessible at https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/SoAy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy.</description>

      <title>RFLPA: A Robust Federated Learning Framework against Poisoning Attacks with Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address the privacy concern, secure aggregation (SecAgg) is often used to obtain the aggregation of gradients on sever without inspecting individual user updates. Unfortunately, existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks rely on the analysis of local updates in plaintext, making them incompatible with SecAgg. To reconcile the conflicts, we propose a robust federated learning framework against poisoning attacks (RFLPA) based on SecAgg protocol. Our framework computes the cosine similarity between local updates and server updates to conduct robust aggregation. Furthermore, we leverage verifiable packed Shamir secret sharing to achieve reduced communication cost of $O(M+N)$ per user, and design a novel dot-product aggregation algorithm to resolve the issue of increased information leakage. Our experimental results show that RFLPA significantly reduces communication and computation overhead by over $75\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art method, BREA, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Estimative Uncertainty in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Words of estimative probability (WEPs), such as ''maybe'' or ''probably not'' are ubiquitous in natural language for communicating estimative uncertainty, compared with direct statements involving numerical probability. Human estimative uncertainty, and its calibration with numerical estimates, has long been an area of study -- including by intelligence agencies like the CIA. This study compares estimative uncertainty in commonly used large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ERNIE-4 to that of humans, and to each other. Here we show that LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 align with human estimates for some, but not all, WEPs presented in English. Divergence is also observed when the LLM is presented with gendered roles and Chinese contexts. Further study shows that an advanced LLM like GPT-4 can consistently map between statistical and estimative uncertainty, but a significant performance gap remains. The results contribute to a growing body of research on human-LLM alignment.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Language Model-based Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is pronounced if there are stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function specific to each problem is challenging, even for domain experts. They would either have to rely on task-specific domain knowledge or provide an expert demonstration independently for each task. Given, that Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly gained prominence across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: Can we leverage LLMs to construct a reward shaping function that can boost the sample efficiency of an RL agent? In this work, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a guide policy by solving a simpler deterministic abstraction of the original problem that can then be used to construct the reward shaping function for the downstream RL agent. Given the ineffectiveness of directly prompting LLMs, we propose MEDIC: a framework that augments LLMs with a Model-based feEDback critIC, which verifies LLM-generated outputs, to generate a possibly sub-optimal but valid plan for the abstract problem. Our experiments across domains from the BabyAI environment suite show 1) the effectiveness of augmenting LLMs with MEDIC, 2) a significant improvement in the sample complexity of PPO and A2C-based RL agents when guided by our LLM-generated plan, and finally, 3) pave the direction for further explorations of how these models can be used to augment existing RL pipelines.</description>

      <title>Decoding at the Speed of Thought: Harnessing Parallel Decoding of Lexical Units for LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional capability in natural language understanding and generation. However, their generation speed is limited by the inherently sequential nature of their decoding process, posing challenges for real-time applications. This paper introduces Lexical Unit Decoding (LUD), a novel decoding methodology implemented in a data-driven manner, accelerating the decoding process without sacrificing output quality. The core of our approach is the observation that a pre-trained language model can confidently predict multiple contiguous tokens, forming the basis for a \textit{lexical unit}, in which these contiguous tokens could be decoded in parallel. Extensive experiments validate that our method substantially reduces decoding time while maintaining generation quality, i.e., 33\% speed up on natural language generation with no quality loss, and 30\% speed up on code generation with a negligible quality loss of 3\%. Distinctively, LUD requires no auxiliary models and does not require changes to existing architectures. It can also be integrated with other decoding acceleration methods, thus achieving an even more pronounced inference efficiency boost. We posit that the foundational principles of LUD could define a new decoding paradigm for future language models, enhancing their applicability for a broader spectrum of applications. All codes are be publicly available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/Lexical-Unit-Decoding-LUD-.

      <title>Leveraging Unknown Objects to Construct Labeled-Unlabeled Meta-Relationships for Zero-Shot Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) addresses situation where an agent navigates to an unseen object that does not present in the training set. Previous works mainly train agent using seen objects with known labels, and ignore the seen objects without labels. In this paper, we introduce seen objects without labels, herein termed as ``unknown objects'', into training procedure to enrich the agent's knowledge base with distinguishable but previously overlooked information. Furthermore, we propose the label-wise meta-correlation module (LWMCM) to harness relationships among objects with and without labels, and obtain enhanced objects information. Specially, we propose target feature generator (TFG) to generate the features representation of the unlabeled target objects. Subsequently, the unlabeled object identifier (UOI) module assesses whether the unlabeled target object appears in the current observation frame captured by the camera and produces an adapted target features representation specific to the observed context. In meta contrastive feature modifier (MCFM), the target features is modified via approaching the features of objects within the observation frame while distancing itself from features of unobserved objects. Finally, the meta object-graph learner (MOGL) module is utilized to calculate the relationships among objects based on the features. Experiments conducted on AI2THOR and RoboTHOR platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Backdoor Attack in Decentralized Reinforcement Learning with Theoretical Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The safety of decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) is a challenging problem since malicious agents can share their poisoned policies with benign agents. The paper investigates a cooperative backdoor attack in a decentralized reinforcement learning scenario. Differing from the existing methods that hide a whole backdoor attack behind their shared policies, our method decomposes the backdoor behavior into multiple components according to the state space of RL. Each malicious agent hides one component in its policy and shares its policy with the benign agents. When a benign agent learns all the poisoned policies, the backdoor attack is assembled in its policy. The theoretical proof is given to show that our cooperative method can successfully inject the backdoor into the RL policies of benign agents. Compared with the existing backdoor attacks, our cooperative method is more covert since the policy from each attacker only contains a component of the backdoor attack and is harder to detect. Extensive simulations are conducted based on Atari environments to demonstrate the efficiency and covertness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper presenting a provable cooperative backdoor attack in decentralized reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Coaching Copilot: Blended Form of an LLM-Powered Chatbot and a Human Coach to Effectively Support Self-Reflection for Leadership Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chatbots' role in fostering self-reflection is now widely recognized, especially in inducing users' behavior change. While the benefits of 24/7 availability, scalability, and consistent responses have been demonstrated in contexts such as healthcare and tutoring to help one form a new habit, their utilization in coaching necessitating deeper introspective dialogue to induce leadership growth remains unexplored. This paper explores the potential of such a chatbot powered by recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaboration with professional coaches in the field of executive coaching. Through a design workshop with them and two weeks of user study involving ten coach-client pairs, we explored the feasibility and nuances of integrating chatbots to complement human coaches. Our findings highlight the benefits of chatbots' ubiquity and reasoning capabilities enabled by LLMs while identifying their limitations and design necessities for effective collaboration between human coaches and chatbots. By doing so, this work contributes to the foundation for augmenting one's self-reflective process with prevalent conversational agents through the human-in-the-loop approach.</description>

      <title>Novel Kernel Models and Exact Representor Theory for Neural Networks Beyond the Over-Parameterized Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two models of neural-networks and their training applicable to neural networks of arbitrary width, depth and topology, assuming only finite-energy neural activations; and a novel representor theory for neural networks in terms of a matrix-valued kernel. The first model is exact (un-approximated) and global, casting the neural network as an elements in a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS); we use this model to provide tight bounds on Rademacher complexity. The second model is exact and local, casting the change in neural network function resulting from a bounded change in weights and biases (ie. a training step) in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in terms of a local-intrinsic neural kernel (LiNK). This local model provides insight into model adaptation through tight bounds on Rademacher complexity of network adaptation. We also prove that the neural tangent kernel (NTK) is a first-order approximation of the LiNK kernel. Finally, and noting that the LiNK does not provide a representor theory for technical reasons, we present an exact novel representor theory for layer-wise neural network training with unregularized gradient descent in terms of a local-extrinsic neural kernel (LeNK). This representor theory gives insight into the role of higher-order statistics in neural network training and the effect of kernel evolution in neural-network kernel models. Throughout the paper (a) feedforward ReLU networks and (b) residual networks (ResNet) are used as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Self-Contrastive Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for Prognostic Prediction Using Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pioneering investigation into the application of deep learning techniques to analyze histopathological images for addressing the substantial challenge of automated prognostic prediction. Prognostic prediction poses a unique challenge as the ground truth labels are inherently weak, and the model must anticipate future events that are not directly observable in the image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel three-part framework comprising of a convolutional network based tissue segmentation algorithm for region of interest delineation, a contrastive learning module for feature extraction, and a nested multiple instance learning classification module. Our study explores the significance of various regions of interest within the histopathological slides and exploits diverse learning scenarios. The pipeline is initially validated on artificially generated data and a simpler diagnostic task. Transitioning to prognostic prediction, tasks become more challenging. Employing bladder cancer as use case, our best models yield an AUC of 0.721 and 0.678 for recurrence and treatment outcome prediction respectively.</description>

      <title>DFGNN: Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph-based recommendation has achieved great success in recent years. However, most existing graph-based recommendations focus on capturing user preference based on positive edges/feedback, while ignoring negative edges/feedback (e.g., dislike, low rating) that widely exist in real-world recommender systems. How to utilize negative feedback in graph-based recommendations still remains underexplored. In this study, we first conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis and found that (1) existing graph neural networks are not well-suited for modeling negative feedback, which acts as a high-frequency signal in a user-item graph. (2) The graph-based recommendation suffers from the representation degeneration problem. Based on the two observations, we propose a novel model that models positive and negative feedback from a frequency filter perspective called Dual-frequency Graph Neural Network for Sign-aware Recommendation (DFGNN). Specifically, in DFGNN, the designed dual-frequency graph filter (DGF) captures both low-frequency and high-frequency signals that contain positive and negative feedback. Furthermore, the proposed signed graph regularization is applied to maintain the user/item embedding uniform in the embedding space to alleviate the representation degeneration problem. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Codes of our model will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LOPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</description>

      <title>Towards a Probabilistic Fusion Approach for Robust Battery Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batteries are a key enabling technology for the decarbonization of transport and energy sectors. The safe and reliable operation of batteries is crucial for battery-powered systems. In this direction, the development of accurate and robust battery state-of-health prognostics models can unlock the potential of autonomous systems for complex, remote and reliable operations. The combination of Neural Networks, Bayesian modelling concepts and ensemble learning strategies, form a valuable prognostics framework to combine uncertainty in a robust and accurate manner. Accordingly, this paper introduces a Bayesian ensemble learning approach to predict the capacity depletion of lithium-ion batteries. The approach accurately predicts the capacity fade and quantifies the uncertainty associated with battery design and degradation processes. The proposed Bayesian ensemble methodology employs a stacking technique, integrating multiple Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as base learners, which have been trained on data diversity. The proposed method has been validated using a battery aging dataset collected by the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence. Obtained results demonstrate the improved accuracy and robustness of the proposed probabilistic fusion approach with respect to (i) a single BNN model and (ii) a classical stacking strategy based on different BNNs.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning guided by the Generalized Bayes Rule under Soft Revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical and computational investigation of the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision, which was recently proposed as a robust criterion for pseudo-label selection (PLS) in semi-supervised learning. Opposed to traditional methods for PLS we use credal sets of priors ("generalized Bayes") to represent the epistemic modeling uncertainty. These latter are then updated by the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision. We eventually select pseudo-labeled data that are most likely in light of the least favorable distribution from the so updated credal set. We formalize the task of finding optimal pseudo-labeled data w.r.t. the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision as an optimization problem. A concrete implementation for the class of logistic models then allows us to compare the predictive power of the method with competing approaches. It is observed that the Gamma-Maximin method with soft revision can achieve very promising results, especially when the proportion of labeled data is low.</description>

      <title>\textsc{Retro}]{\textsc{Retro}: \underline{Re}using \underline{t}eacher p\underline{ro}jection head for efficient embedding distillation on Lightweight Models via Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is gaining attention for its ability to learn effective representations with large amounts of unlabeled data.
  Lightweight models can be distilled from larger self-supervised pre-trained models using contrastive and consistency constraints.
  Still, the different sizes of the projection heads make it challenging for students to mimic the teacher's embedding accurately.
  We propose \textsc{Retro}, which reuses the teacher's projection head for students, and our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on all lightweight models.
  For instance, when training EfficientNet-B0 using ResNet-50/101/152 as teachers, our approach improves the linear result on ImageNet to $66.9\%$, $69.3\%$, and $69.8\%$, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>NuwaTS: Mending Every Incomplete Time Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series imputation plays a crucial role in various real-world systems and has been extensively explored. Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</description>

      <title>Are Long-LLMs A Necessity For Long-Context Tasks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The learning and deployment of long-LLMs remains a challenging problem despite recent progresses. In this work, we argue that the long-LLMs are not a necessity to solve long-context tasks, as common long-context tasks are short-context solvable, i.e. they can be solved by purely working with oracle short-contexts within the long-context tasks' inputs. On top of this argument, we propose a framework called LC-Boost (Long-Context Bootstrapper), which enables a short-LLM to address the long-context tasks in a bootstrapping manner. In our framework, the short-LLM prompts itself to reason for two critical decisions: 1) how to access to the appropriate part of context within the input, 2) how to make effective use of the accessed context. By adaptively accessing and utilizing the context based on the presented tasks, LC-Boost can serve as a general framework to handle diversified long-context processing problems. We comprehensively evaluate different types of tasks from popular long-context benchmarks, where LC-Boost is able to achieve a substantially improved performance with a much smaller consumption of resource.</description>

      <title>Stacking Your Transformers: A Closer Look at Model Growth for Efficient LLM Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are computationally expensive to pre-train due to their large scale. Model growth emerges as a promising approach by leveraging smaller models to accelerate the training of larger ones. However, the viability of these model growth methods in efficient LLM pre-training remains underexplored. This work identifies three critical $\underline{\textit{O}}$bstacles: ($\textit{O}$1) lack of comprehensive evaluation, ($\textit{O}$2) untested viability for scaling, and ($\textit{O}$3) lack of empirical guidelines. To tackle $\textit{O}$1, we summarize existing approaches into four atomic growth operators and systematically evaluate them in a standardized LLM pre-training setting. Our findings reveal that a depthwise stacking operator, called $G_{\text{stack}}$, exhibits remarkable acceleration in training, leading to decreased loss and improved overall performance on eight standard NLP benchmarks compared to strong baselines. Motivated by these promising results, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into $G_{\text{stack}}$ to address $\textit{O}$2 and $\textit{O}$3. For $\textit{O}$2 (untested scalability), our study shows that $G_{\text{stack}}$ is scalable and consistently performs well, with experiments up to 7B LLMs after growth and pre-training LLMs with 750B tokens. For example, compared to a conventionally trained 7B model using 300B tokens, our $G_{\text{stack}}$ model converges to the same loss with 194B tokens, resulting in a 54.6\% speedup. We further address $\textit{O}$3 (lack of empirical guidelines) by formalizing guidelines to determine growth timing and growth factor for $G_{\text{stack}}$, making it practical in general LLM pre-training. We also provide in-depth discussions and comprehensive ablation studies of $G_{\text{stack}}$. Our code and pre-trained model are available at $\href{https://llm-stacking.github.io/}{https://llm-stacking.github.io/}$.</description>

      <title>Organic Data-Driven Approach for Turkish Grammatical Error Correction and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction has seen significant progress with the recent advancements in deep learning. As those methods require huge amounts of data, synthetic datasets are being built to fill this gap. Unfortunately, synthetic datasets are not organic enough in some cases and even require clean data to start with. Furthermore, most of the work that has been done is focused mostly on English. In this work, we introduce a new organic data-driven approach, clean insertions, to build parallel Turkish Grammatical Error Correction datasets from any organic data, and to clean the data used for training Large Language Models. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two Turkish Grammatical Error Correction test sets out of the three publicly available ones. We also show the effectiveness of our method on the training losses of training language models.</description>

      <title>Continuously Learning, Adapting, and Improving: A Dual-Process Approach to Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has advanced significantly due to sensors, machine learning, and artificial intelligence improvements. However, prevailing methods struggle with intricate scenarios and causal relationships, hindering adaptability and interpretability in varied environments. To address the above problems, we introduce LeapAD, a novel paradigm for autonomous driving inspired by the human cognitive process. Specifically, LeapAD emulates human attention by selecting critical objects relevant to driving decisions, simplifying environmental interpretation, and mitigating decision-making complexities. Additionally, LeapAD incorporates an innovative dual-process decision-making module, which consists of an Analytic Process (System-II) for thorough analysis and reasoning, along with a Heuristic Process (System-I) for swift and empirical processing. The Analytic Process leverages its logical reasoning to accumulate linguistic driving experience, which is then transferred to the Heuristic Process by supervised fine-tuning. Through reflection mechanisms and a growing memory bank, LeapAD continuously improves itself from past mistakes in a closed-loop environment. Closed-loop testing in CARLA shows that LeapAD outperforms all methods relying solely on camera input, requiring 1-2 orders of magnitude less labeled data. Experiments also demonstrate that as the memory bank expands, the Heuristic Process with only 1.8B parameters can inherit the knowledge from a GPT-4 powered Analytic Process and achieve continuous performance improvement. Code will be released at https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/LeapAD.</description>

      <title>BiSup: Bidirectional Quantization Error Suppression for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the size and context length of Large Language Models (LLMs) grow, weight-activation quantization has emerged as a crucial technique for efficient deployment of LLMs. Compared to weight-only quantization, weight-activation quantization presents greater challenges due to the presence of outliers in activations. Existing methods have made significant progress by exploring mixed-precision quantization and outlier suppression. However, these methods primarily focus on optimizing the results of single matrix multiplication, neglecting the bidirectional propagation of quantization errors in LLMs. Specifically, errors accumulate vertically within the same token through layers, and diffuse horizontally across different tokens due to self-attention mechanisms. To address this issue, we introduce BiSup, a Bidirectional quantization error Suppression method. By constructing appropriate optimizable parameter spaces, BiSup utilizes a small amount of data for quantization-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning to suppress the error vertical accumulation. Besides, BiSup employs prompt mixed-precision quantization strategy, which preserves high precision for the key-value cache of system prompts, to mitigate the error horizontal diffusion. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that BiSup can improve performance over two state-of-the-art methods (the average WikiText2 perplexity decreases from 13.26 to 9.41 for Atom and from 14.33 to 7.85 for QuaRot under the W3A3-g128 configuration), further facilitating the practical applications of low-bit weight-activation quantization.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Policy Adaptation by Capturing Representation Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is vital to learn effective policies that can be transferred to different domains with dynamics discrepancies in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we consider dynamics adaptation settings where there exists dynamics mismatch between the source domain and the target domain, and one can get access to sufficient source domain data, while can only have limited interactions with the target domain. Existing methods address this problem by learning domain classifiers, performing data filtering from a value discrepancy perspective, etc. Instead, we tackle this challenge from a decoupled representation learning perspective. We perform representation learning only in the target domain and measure the representation deviations on the transitions from the source domain, which we show can be a signal of dynamics mismatch. We also show that representation deviation upper bounds performance difference of a given policy in the source domain and target domain, which motivates us to adopt representation deviation as a reward penalty. The produced representations are not involved in either policy or value function, but only serve as a reward penalizer. We conduct extensive experiments on environments with kinematic and morphology mismatch, and the results show that our method exhibits strong performance on many tasks.

      <title>Autonomous Quilt Spreading for Caregiving Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel strategy to ensure infants, who inadvertently displace their quilts during sleep, are promptly and accurately re-covered. Our approach is formulated into two subsequent steps: interference resolution and quilt spreading. By leveraging the DWPose human skeletal detection and the Segment Anything instance segmentation models, the proposed method can accurately recognize the states of the infant and the quilt over her, which involves addressing the interferences resulted from an infant's limbs laid on part of the quilt. Building upon prior research, the EM*D deep learning model is employed to forecast quilt state transitions before and after quilt spreading actions. To improve the sensitivity of the network in distinguishing state variation of the handled quilt, we introduce an enhanced loss function that translates the voxelized quilt state into a more representative one. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate the efficacy of our method, in spreading and recover a quilt over an infant.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Semantic Query Processing in a Scholarly Knowledge Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed research aims to develop an innovative semantic query processing system that enables users to obtain comprehensive information about research works produced by Computer Science (CS) researchers at the Australian National University (ANU). The system integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ANU Scholarly Knowledge Graph (ASKG), a structured repository of all research-related artifacts produced at ANU in the CS field. Each artifact and its parts are represented as textual nodes stored in a Knowledge Graph (KG).
  To address the limitations of traditional scholarly KG construction and utilization methods, which often fail to capture fine-grained details, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Deep Document Model (DDM) for comprehensive document representation and the KG-enhanced Query Processing (KGQP) for optimized complex query handling. DDM enables a fine-grained representation of the hierarchical structure and semantic relationships within academic papers, while KGQP leverages the KG structure to improve query accuracy and efficiency with LLMs.
  By combining the ASKG with LLMs, our approach enhances knowledge utilization and natural language understanding capabilities. The proposed system employs an automatic LLM-SPARQL fusion to retrieve relevant facts and textual nodes from the ASKG. Initial experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to baseline methods in terms of accuracy retrieval and query efficiency.
  We showcase the practical application of our framework in academic research scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize scholarly knowledge management and discovery. This work empowers researchers to acquire and utilize knowledge from documents more effectively and provides a foundation for developing precise and reliable interactions with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Full-stack evaluation of Machine Learning inference workloads for RISC-V systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architectural simulators hold a vital role in RISC-V research, providing a crucial platform for workload evaluation without the need for costly physical prototypes. They serve as a dynamic environment for exploring innovative architectural concepts, enabling swift iteration and thorough analysis of performance metrics. As deep learning algorithms become increasingly pervasive, it is essential to benchmark new architectures with machine learning workloads. The diverse computational kernels used in deep learning algorithms highlight the necessity for a comprehensive compilation toolchain to map to target hardware platforms. This study evaluates the performance of a wide array of machine learning workloads on RISC-V architectures using gem5, an open-source architectural simulator. Leveraging an open-source compilation toolchain based on Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR), the research presents benchmarking results specifically focused on deep learning inference workloads. Additionally, the study sheds light on current limitations of gem5 when simulating RISC-V architectures, offering insights for future development and refinement.</description>

      <title>PriCE: Privacy-Preserving and Cost-Effective Scheduling for Parallelizing the Large Medical Image Processing Workflow over Hybrid Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry and time-consuming task with centralized computing. Outsourcing such medical image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies, yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and monetary cost under user's budget.</description>

      <title>ORCA: A Global Ocean Emulator for Multi-year to Decadal Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean dynamics plays a crucial role in driving global weather and climate patterns. Accurate and efficient modeling of ocean dynamics is essential for improved understanding of complex ocean circulation and processes, for predicting climate variations and their associated teleconnections, and for addressing the challenges of climate change. While great efforts have been made to improve numerical Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs), accurate forecasting of global oceanic variations for multi-year remains to be a long-standing challenge. Here, we introduce ORCA (Oceanic Reliable foreCAst), the first data-driven model predicting global ocean circulation from multi-year to decadal time scales. ORCA accurately simulates the three-dimensional circulations and dynamics of the global ocean with high physical consistency. Hindcasts of key oceanic variables demonstrate ORCA's remarkable prediction skills in predicting ocean variations compared with state-of-the-art numerical OGCMs and abilities in capturing occurrences of extreme events at the subsurface ocean and ENSO vertical patterns. These results demonstrate the potential of data-driven ocean models for providing cheap, efficient, and accurate global ocean modeling and prediction. Moreover, ORCA stably and faithfully emulates ocean dynamics at decadal timescales, demonstrating its potential even for climate projections. The model will be available at https://github.com/OpenEarthLab/ORCA.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Context Retrieval Augmented Generation Pipeline: LLM-Augmented Knowledge Graphs and Vector Database for Accreditation Reporting Assistance</title>

Abstract: In higher education, accreditation is a quality assurance process, where an institution demonstrates a commitment to delivering high quality programs and services to their students. For business schools nationally and internationally the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) accreditation is the gold standard. For a business school to receive and subsequently maintain accreditation, the school must undertake a rigorous, time consuming reporting and peer review process, to demonstrate alignment with the AACSB Standards. For this project we create a hybrid context retrieval augmented generation pipeline that can assist in the documentation alignment and reporting process necessary for accreditation. We implement both a vector database and knowledge graph, as knowledge stores containing both institutional data and AACSB Standard data. The output of the pipeline can be used by institution stakeholders to build their accreditation report, dually grounded by the context from the knowledge stores. To develop our knowledge graphs we utilized both a manual construction process as well as an LLM Augmented Knowledge Graph approach. We evaluated the pipeline using the RAGAs framework and observed optimal performance on answer relevancy and answer correctness metrics.</description>

      <title>Text-guided 3D Human Motion Generation with Keyframe-based Parallel Skip Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation is an emerging task in animation and humanoid robot design. Existing algorithms directly generate the full sequence which is computationally expensive and prone to errors as it does not pay special attention to key poses, a process that has been the cornerstone of animation for decades. We propose KeyMotion, that generates plausible human motion sequences corresponding to input text by first generating keyframes followed by in-filling. We use a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Kullback-Leibler regularization to project the keyframes into a latent space to reduce dimensionality and further accelerate the subsequent diffusion process. For the reverse diffusion, we propose a novel Parallel Skip Transformer that performs cross-modal attention between the keyframe latents and text condition. To complete the motion sequence, we propose a text-guided Transformer designed to perform motion-in-filling, ensuring the preservation of both fidelity and adherence to the physical constraints of human motion. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-theart results on the HumanML3D dataset outperforming others on all R-precision metrics and MultiModal Distance. KeyMotion also achieves competitive performance on the KIT dataset, achieving the best results on Top3 R-precision, FID, and Diversity metrics.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Accuracy Trade-Offs: A Causal Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems based on machine learning may exhibit discriminatory behavior based on sensitive characteristics such as gender, sex, religion, or race. In light of this, various notions of fairness and methods to quantify discrimination were proposed, leading to the development of numerous approaches for constructing fair predictors. At the same time, imposing fairness constraints may decrease the utility of the decision-maker, highlighting a tension between fairness and utility. This tension is also recognized in legal frameworks, for instance in the disparate impact doctrine of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- in which specific attention is given to considerations of business necessity -- possibly allowing the usage of proxy variables associated with the sensitive attribute in case a high-enough utility cannot be achieved without them. In this work, we analyze the tension between fairness and accuracy from a causal lens for the first time. We introduce the notion of a path-specific excess loss (PSEL) that captures how much the predictor's loss increases when a causal fairness constraint is enforced. We then show that the total excess loss (TEL), defined as the difference between the loss of predictor fair along all causal pathways vs. an unconstrained predictor, can be decomposed into a sum of more local PSELs. At the same time, enforcing a causal constraint often reduces the disparity between demographic groups. Thus, we introduce a quantity that summarizes the fairness-utility trade-off, called the causal fairness/utility ratio, defined as the ratio of the reduction in discrimination vs. the excess loss from constraining a causal pathway. This quantity is suitable for comparing the fairness-utility trade-off across causal pathways. Finally, as our approach requires causally-constrained fair predictors, we introduce a new neural approach for causally-constrained fair learning.</description>

      <title>HyperInterval: Hypernetwork approach to training weight interval regions in continual learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HyperInterval, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HyperInterval maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and can be seen as a meta-trainer. HyperInterval obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: A Causal Perspective on Bias Amplification in Prediction &amp; Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating fairness and equity of automated systems has become a critical field of inquiry. Most of the literature in fair machine learning focuses on defining and achieving fairness criteria in the context of prediction, while not explicitly focusing on how these predictions may be used later on in the pipeline. For instance, if commonly used criteria, such as independence or sufficiency, are satisfied for a prediction score $S$ used for binary classification, they need not be satisfied after an application of a simple thresholding operation on $S$ (as commonly used in practice). In this paper, we take an important step to address this issue in numerous statistical and causal notions of fairness. We introduce the notion of a margin complement, which measures how much a prediction score $S$ changes due to a thresholding operation. We then demonstrate that the marginal difference in the optimal 0/1 predictor $\widehat Y$ between groups, written $P(\hat y \mid x_1) - P(\hat y \mid x_0)$, can be causally decomposed into the influences of $X$ on the $L_2$-optimal prediction score $S$ and the influences of $X$ on the margin complement $M$, along different causal pathways (direct, indirect, spurious). We then show that under suitable causal assumptions, the influences of $X$ on the prediction score $S$ are equal to the influences of $X$ on the true outcome $Y$. This yields a new decomposition of the disparity in the predictor $\widehat Y$ that allows us to disentangle causal differences inherited from the true outcome $Y$ that exists in the real world vs. those coming from the optimization procedure itself. This observation highlights the need for more regulatory oversight due to the potential for bias amplification, and to address this issue we introduce new notions of weak and strong business necessity, together with an algorithm for assessing whether these notions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Logical Rules in Knowledge Editing: A Cherry on the Top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MQA) under knowledge editing (KE) is a key challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). While best-performing solutions in this domain use a plan and solve paradigm to split a question into sub-questions followed by response generation, we claim that this approach is sub-optimal as it fails for hard to decompose questions, and it does not explicitly cater to correlated knowledge updates resulting as a consequence of knowledge edits. This has a detrimental impact on the overall consistency of the updated knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named RULE-KE, i.e., RULE based Knowledge Editing, which is a cherry on the top for augmenting the performance of all existing MQA methods under KE. Specifically, RULE-KE leverages rule discovery to discover a set of logical rules. Then, it uses these discovered rules to update knowledge about facts highly correlated with the edit. Experimental evaluation using existing and newly curated datasets (i.e., RKE-EVAL) shows that RULE-KE helps augment both performances of parameter-based and memory-based solutions up to 92% and 112.9%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Pre-trained Large Language Models' Potential Across Urdu NLP tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on multilingual data have revolutionized natural language processing research, by transitioning from languages and task specific model pipelines to a single model adapted on a variety of tasks. However majority of existing multilingual NLP benchmarks for LLMs provide evaluation data in only few languages with little linguistic diversity. In addition these benchmarks lack quality assessment against the respective state-of the art models. This study presents an in-depth examination of prominent LLMs; GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama2-7B-Chat, Bloomz 7B1 and Bloomz 3B, across 14 tasks using 15 Urdu datasets, in a zero-shot setting, and their performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, has been compared and analysed. Our experiments show that SOTA models surpass all the encoder-decoder pre-trained language models in all Urdu NLP tasks with zero-shot learning. Our results further show that LLMs with fewer parameters, but more language specific data in the base model perform better than larger computational models, but low language data.</description>

      <title>Editable Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on cases where the data, including concepts, are clean. In many scenarios, we always need to remove/insert some training data or new concepts from trained CBMs due to different reasons, such as privacy concerns, data mislabelling, spurious concepts, and concept annotation errors. Thus, the challenge of deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch persists, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Editable Concept Bottleneck Models (ECBMs). Specifically, ECBMs support three different levels of data removal: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level. ECBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for re-training. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our ECBMs, affirming their adaptability within the realm of CBMs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Counterfactual Regression through the Lens of Gromov-Wasserstein Information Bottleneck</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising individualized treatment effect (ITE) estimation method, counterfactual regression (CFR) maps individuals' covariates to a latent space and predicts their counterfactual outcomes. However, the selection bias between control and treatment groups often imbalances the two groups' latent distributions and negatively impacts this method's performance. In this study, we revisit counterfactual regression through the lens of information bottleneck and propose a novel learning paradigm called Gromov-Wasserstein information bottleneck (GWIB). In this paradigm, we learn CFR by maximizing the mutual information between covariates' latent representations and outcomes while penalizing the kernelized mutual information between the latent representations and the covariates. We demonstrate that the upper bound of the penalty term can be implemented as a new regularizer consisting of $i)$ the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the latent representations of different groups and $ii)$ the gap between the transport cost generated by the model and the cross-group Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the latent representations and the covariates. GWIB effectively learns the CFR model through alternating optimization, suppressing selection bias while avoiding trivial latent distributions. Experiments on ITE estimation tasks show that GWIB consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CFR methods. To promote the research community, we release our project at https://github.com/peteryang1031/Causal-GWIB.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT Code Detection: Techniques for Uncovering the Source of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in generating computer code, blurring the lines between code created by humans and code produced by artificial intelligence (AI). As these technologies evolve rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation, especially given the risk of misuse in areas like higher education. This paper explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to differentiate between code written by humans and that generated by ChatGPT, a type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features (black-box) with supervised learning algorithms - including Deep Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - to achieve this differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well but provide at most 85-88% accuracy. We also show that untrained humans solve the same task not better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation, particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and competitive programming.</description>

      <title>On the Convexity and Reliability of the Bethe Free Energy Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe free energy approximation provides an effective way for relaxing NP-hard problems of probabilistic inference. However, its accuracy depends on the model parameters and particularly degrades if a phase transition in the model occurs. In this work, we analyze when the Bethe approximation is reliable and how this can be verified. We argue and show by experiment that it is mostly accurate if it is convex on a submanifold of its domain, the 'Bethe box'. For verifying its convexity, we derive two sufficient conditions that are based on the definiteness properties of the Bethe Hessian matrix: the first uses the concept of diagonal dominance, and the second decomposes the Bethe Hessian matrix into a sum of sparse matrices and characterizes the definiteness properties of the individual matrices in that sum. These theoretical results provide a simple way to estimate the critical phase transition temperature of a model. As a practical contribution we propose $\texttt{BETHE-MIN}$, a projected quasi-Newton method to efficiently find a minimum of the Bethe free energy.</description>

      <title>A Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information in Re-ranking for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Re-ranking is a process of rearranging ranking list to more effectively meet user demands by accounting for the interrelationships between items. Existing methods predominantly enhance the precision of search results, often at the expense of diversity, leading to outcomes that may not fulfill the varied needs of users. Conversely, methods designed to promote diversity might compromise the precision of the results, failing to satisfy the users' requirements for accuracy. To alleviate the above problems, this paper proposes a Preference-oriented Diversity Model Based on Mutual-information (PODM-MI), which consider both accuracy and diversity in the re-ranking process. Specifically, PODM-MI adopts Multidimensional Gaussian distributions based on variational inference to capture users' diversity preferences with uncertainty. Then we maximize the mutual information between the diversity preferences of the users and the candidate items using the maximum variational inference lower bound to enhance their correlations. Subsequently, we derive a utility matrix based on the correlations, enabling the adaptive ranking of items in line with user preferences and establishing a balance between the aforementioned objectives. Experimental results on real-world online e-commerce systems demonstrate the significant improvements of PODM-MI, and we have successfully deployed PODM-MI on an e-commerce search platform.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-enhanced Relation Graph and Task Sampling for Few-shot Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has garnered increasing attention. Despite impressive breakthroughs achieved by existing methods, they often overlook the inherent many-to-many relationships between molecules and properties, which limits their performance. For instance, similar substructures of molecules can inspire the exploration of new compounds. Additionally, the relationships between properties can be quantified, with high-related properties providing more information in exploring the target property than those low-related. To this end, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning FSMPP framework (KRGTS), which comprises the Knowledge-enhanced Relation Graph module and the Task Sampling module. The knowledge-enhanced relation graph module constructs the molecule-property multi-relation graph (MPMRG) to capture the many-to-many relationships between molecules and properties. The task sampling module includes a meta-training task sampler and an auxiliary task sampler, responsible for scheduling the meta-training process and sampling high-related auxiliary tasks, respectively, thereby achieving efficient meta-knowledge learning and reducing noise introduction. Empirically, extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of KRGTS over a variety of state-of-the-art methods. The code is available in https://github.com/Vencent-Won/KRGTS-public.</description>

      <title>When Generative AI Meets Workplace Learning: Creating A Realistic &amp; Motivating Learning Experience With A Generative PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Workplace learning is used to train employees systematically, e.g., via e-learning or in 1:1 training. However, this is often deemed ineffective and costly. Whereas pure e-learning lacks the possibility of conversational exercise and personal contact, 1:1 training with human instructors involves a high level of personnel and organizational costs. Hence, pedagogical conversational agents (PCAs), based on generative AI, seem to compensate for the disadvantages of both forms. Following Action Design Research, this paper describes an organizational communication training with a Generative PCA (GenPCA). The evaluation shows promising results: the agent was perceived positively among employees and contributed to an improvement in self-determined learning. However, the integration of such agent comes not without limitations. We conclude with suggestions concerning the didactical methods, which are supported by a GenPCA, and possible improvements of such an agent for workplace learning.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Independent Cross-Entropy Loss For Graph-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited prominent performance in learning graph-structured data. Considering node classification task, based on the i.i.d assumption among node labels, the traditional supervised learning simply sums up cross-entropy losses of the independent training nodes and applies the average loss to optimize GNNs' weights. But different from other data formats, the nodes are naturally connected. It is found that the independent distribution modeling of node labels restricts GNNs' capability to generalize over the entire graph and defend adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework, termed joint-cluster supervised learning, to model the joint distribution of each node with its corresponding cluster. We learn the joint distribution of node and cluster labels conditioned on their representations, and train GNNs with the obtained joint loss. In this way, the data-label reference signals extracted from the local cluster explicitly strengthen the discrimination ability on the target node. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our joint-cluster supervised learning can effectively bolster GNNs' node classification accuracy. Furthermore, being benefited from the reference signals which may be free from spiteful interference, our learning paradigm significantly protects the node classification from being affected by the adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Generating density nowcasts for U.S. GDP growth with deep learning: Bayes by Backprop and Monte Carlo dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results in the literature indicate that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can outperform the dynamic factor model (DFM) in terms of the accuracy of GDP nowcasts. Compared to the DFM, the performance advantage of these highly flexible, nonlinear estimators is particularly evident in periods of recessions and structural breaks. From the perspective of policy-makers, however, nowcasts are the most useful when they are conveyed with uncertainty attached to them. While the DFM and other classical time series approaches analytically derive the predictive (conditional) distribution for GDP growth, ANNs can only produce point nowcasts based on their default training procedure (backpropagation). To fill this gap, first in the literature, we adapt two different deep learning algorithms that enable ANNs to generate density nowcasts for U.S. GDP growth: Bayes by Backprop and Monte Carlo dropout. The accuracy of point nowcasts, defined as the mean of the empirical predictive distribution, is evaluated relative to a naive constant growth model for GDP and a benchmark DFM specification. Using a 1D CNN as the underlying ANN architecture, both algorithms outperform those benchmarks during the evaluation period (2012:Q1 -- 2022:Q4). Furthermore, both algorithms are able to dynamically adjust the location (mean), scale (variance), and shape (skew) of the empirical predictive distribution. The results indicate that both Bayes by Backprop and Monte Carlo dropout can effectively augment the scope and functionality of ANNs, rendering them a fully compatible and competitive alternative for classical time series approaches.</description>

      <title>MCDFN: Supply Chain Demand Forecasting via an Explainable Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network Model Integrating CNN, LSTM, and GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing supply chain management. Traditional methods often fail to capture complex patterns from seasonal variability and special events. Despite advancements in deep learning, interpretable forecasting models remain a challenge. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Channel Data Fusion Network (MCDFN), a hybrid architecture that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to enhance predictive performance by extracting spatial and temporal features from time series data. Our rigorous benchmarking demonstrates that MCDFN outperforms seven other deep-learning models, achieving superior metrics: MSE (23.5738%), RMSE (4.8553%), MAE (3.9991%), and MAPE (20.1575%). Additionally, MCDFN's predictions were statistically indistinguishable from actual values, confirmed by a paired t-test with a 5% p-value and a 10-fold cross-validated statistical paired t-test. We apply explainable AI techniques like ShapTime and Permutation Feature Importance to enhance interpretability. This research advances demand forecasting methodologies and offers practical guidelines for integrating MCDFN into supply chain systems, highlighting future research directions for scalability and user-friendly deployment.</description>

      <title>Automatic Data Curation for Self-Supervised Learning: A Clustering-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised features are the cornerstone of modern machine learning systems. They are typically pre-trained on data collections whose construction and curation typically require extensive human effort. This manual process has some limitations similar to those encountered in supervised learning, e.g., the crowd-sourced selection of data is costly and time-consuming, preventing scaling the dataset size. In this work, we consider the problem of automatic curation of high-quality datasets for self-supervised pre-training. We posit that such datasets should be large, diverse and balanced, and propose a clustering-based approach for building ones satisfying all these criteria. Our method involves successive and hierarchical applications of $k$-means on a large and diverse data repository to obtain clusters that distribute uniformly among data concepts, followed by a hierarchical, balanced sampling step from these clusters. Extensive experiments on three different data domains including web-based images, satellite images and text show that features trained on our automatically curated datasets outperform those trained on uncurated data while being on par or better than ones trained on manually curated data.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Large Language Models for Software Vulnerability Detection: A Comprehensive Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite various approaches being employed to detect vulnerabilities, the number of reported vulnerabilities shows an upward trend over the years. This suggests the problems are not caught before the code is released, which could be caused by many factors, like lack of awareness, limited efficacy of the existing vulnerability detection tools or the tools not being user-friendly. To help combat some issues with traditional vulnerability detection tools, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to assist in finding vulnerabilities in source code. LLMs have shown a remarkable ability to understand and generate code, underlining their potential in code-related tasks. The aim is to test multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and identify the best prompting strategies, allowing extraction of the best value from the LLMs. We provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach and compare the results to those of traditional static analysis tools. We find that LLMs can pinpoint many more issues than traditional static analysis tools, outperforming traditional tools in terms of recall and F1 scores. The results should benefit software developers and security analysts responsible for ensuring that the code is free of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their safety and utility. However, existing methods, primarily based on preference datasets, face challenges such as noisy labels, high annotation costs, and privacy concerns. In this work, we introduce Alignment from Demonstrations (AfD), a novel approach leveraging high-quality demonstration data to overcome these challenges. We formalize AfD within a sequential decision-making framework, highlighting its unique challenge of missing reward signals. Drawing insights from forward and inverse reinforcement learning, we introduce divergence minimization objectives for AfD. Analytically, we elucidate the mass-covering and mode-seeking behaviors of various approaches, explaining when and why certain methods are superior. Practically, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that extrapolates over a tailored reward model for AfD. We validate our key insights through experiments on the Harmless and Helpful tasks, demonstrating their strong empirical performance while maintaining simplicity.</description>

      <title>Less is more: Summarizing Patch Tokens for efficient Multi-Label Class-Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective rehearsal-free technique for class-incremental learning (CIL) that learns a tiny set of task-specific parameters (or prompts) to instruct a pre-trained transformer to learn on a sequence of tasks. Albeit effective, prompt tuning methods do not lend well in the multi-label class incremental learning (MLCIL) scenario (where an image contains multiple foreground classes) due to the ambiguity in selecting the correct prompt(s) corresponding to different foreground objects belonging to multiple tasks. To circumvent this issue we propose to eliminate the prompt selection mechanism by maintaining task-specific pathways, which allow us to learn representations that do not interact with the ones from the other tasks. Since independent pathways in truly incremental scenarios will result in an explosion of computation due to the quadratically complex multi-head self-attention (MSA) operation in prompt tuning, we propose to reduce the original patch token embeddings into summarized tokens. Prompt tuning is then applied to these fewer summarized tokens to compute the final representation. Our proposed method Multi-Label class incremental learning via summarising pAtch tokeN Embeddings (MULTI-LANE) enables learning disentangled task-specific representations in MLCIL while ensuring fast inference. We conduct experiments in common benchmarks and demonstrate that our MULTI-LANE achieves a new state-of-the-art in MLCIL. Additionally, we show that MULTI-LANE is also competitive in the CIL setting.

      <description>arXiv:2405.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GECKO, a bilingual large language model (LLM) optimized for Korean and English, along with programming languages. GECKO is pretrained on the balanced, high-quality corpus of Korean and English employing LLaMA architecture. In this report, we share the experiences of several efforts to build a better data pipeline for the corpus and to train our model. GECKO shows great efficiency in token generations for both Korean and English, despite its small size of vocabulary. We measure the performance on the representative benchmarks in terms of Korean, English and Code, and it exhibits great performance on KMMLU (Korean MMLU) and modest performance in English and Code, even with its smaller number of trained tokens compared to English-focused LLMs. GECKO is available to the open-source community under a permissive license. We hope our work offers a research baseline and practical insights for Korean LLM research. The model can be found at: https://huggingface.co/kifai/GECKO-7B</description>

      <title>Effective Confidence Region Prediction Using Probability Forecasters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confidence region prediction is a practically useful extension to the commonly studied pattern recognition problem. Instead of predicting a single label, the constraint is relaxed to allow prediction of a subset of labels given a desired confidence level 1-delta. Ideally, effective region predictions should be (1) well calibrated - predictive regions at confidence level 1-delta should err with relative frequency at most delta and (2) be as narrow (or certain) as possible. We present a simple technique to generate confidence region predictions from conditional probability estimates (probability forecasts). We use this 'conversion' technique to generate confidence region predictions from probability forecasts output by standard machine learning algorithms when tested on 15 multi-class datasets. Our results show that approximately 44% of experiments demonstrate well-calibrated confidence region predictions, with the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm tending to perform consistently well across all data. Our results illustrate the practical benefits of effective confidence region prediction with respect to medical diagnostics, where guarantees of capturing the true disease label can be given.</description>

      <title>HDC: Hierarchical Semantic Decoding with Counting Assistance for Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly proposed Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES) amplifies the formulation of classic RES by involving multiple/non-target scenarios. Recent approaches focus on optimizing the last modality-fused feature which is directly utilized for segmentation and object-existence identification. However, the attempt to integrate all-grained information into a single joint representation is impractical in GRES due to the increased complexity of the spatial relationships among instances and deceptive text descriptions. Furthermore, the subsequent binary target justification across all referent scenarios fails to specify their inherent differences, leading to ambiguity in object understanding. To address the weakness, we propose a $\textbf{H}$ierarchical Semantic $\textbf{D}$ecoding with $\textbf{C}$ounting Assistance framework (HDC). It hierarchically transfers complementary modality information across granularities, and then aggregates each well-aligned semantic correspondence for multi-level decoding. Moreover, with complete semantic context modeling, we endow HDC with explicit counting capability to facilitate comprehensive object perception in multiple/single/non-target settings. Experimental results on gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of HDC which outperforms the state-of-the-art GRES methods by a remarkable margin. Code will be available $\href{https://github.com/RobertLuo1/HDC}{here}$.</description>

      <title>Exposing Image Classifier Shortcuts with Counterfactual Frequency (CoF) Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning in image classification has brought unprecedented accuracy but also highlighted a key issue: the use of 'shortcuts' by models. Such shortcuts are easy-to-learn patterns from the training data that fail to generalise to new data. Examples include the use of a copyright watermark to recognise horses, snowy background to recognise huskies, or ink markings to detect malignant skin lesions. The explainable AI (XAI) community has suggested using instance-level explanations to detect shortcuts without external data, but this requires the examination of many explanations to confirm the presence of such shortcuts, making it a labour-intensive process. To address these challenges, we introduce Counterfactual Frequency (CoF) tables, a novel approach that aggregates instance-based explanations into global insights, and exposes shortcuts. The aggregation implies the need for some semantic concepts to be used in the explanations, which we solve by labelling the segments of an image. We demonstrate the utility of CoF tables across several datasets, revealing the shortcuts learned from them.</description>

      <title>Consistency of Neural Causal Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in Neural Causal Models (NCMs) showcased how identification and partial identification of causal effects can be automatically carried out via training of neural generative models that respect the constraints encoded in a given causal graph [Xia et al. 2022, Balazadeh et al. 2022]. However, formal consistency of these methods has only been proven for the case of discrete variables or only for linear causal models. In this work, we prove consistency of partial identification via NCMs in a general setting with both continuous and categorical variables. Further, our results highlight the impact of the design of the underlying neural network architecture in terms of depth and connectivity as well as the importance of applying Lipschitz regularization in the training phase. In particular, we provide a counterexample showing that without Lipschitz regularization the NCM may not be asymptotically consistent. Our results are enabled by new results on the approximability of structural causal models via neural generative models, together with an analysis of the sample complexity of the resulting architectures and how that translates into an error in the constrained optimization problem that defines the partial identification bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free).</description>

      <title>VDGD: Mitigating LVLM Hallucinations in Cognitive Prompts by Bridging the Visual Perception Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for practical applications is moderated by the significant challenge of hallucination or the inconsistency between the factual information and the generated text. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of hallucinations and discover several novel insights about how and when LVLMs hallucinate. From our analysis, we show that: (1) The community's efforts have been primarily targeted towards reducing hallucinations related to visual recognition (VR) prompts (e.g., prompts that only require describing the image), thereby ignoring hallucinations for cognitive prompts (e.g., prompts that require additional skills like reasoning on contents of the image). (2) LVLMs lack visual perception, i.e., they can see but not necessarily understand or perceive the input image. We analyze responses to cognitive prompts and show that LVLMs hallucinate due to a perception gap: although LVLMs accurately recognize visual elements in the input image and possess sufficient cognitive skills, they struggle to respond accurately and hallucinate. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose Visual Description Grounded Decoding (VDGD), a simple, robust, and training-free method for alleviating hallucinations. Specifically, we first describe the image and add it as a prefix to the instruction. Next, during auto-regressive decoding, we sample from the plausible candidates according to their KL-Divergence (KLD) to the description, where lower KLD is given higher preference. Experimental results on several benchmarks and LVLMs show that VDGD improves significantly over other baselines in reducing hallucinations. We also propose VaLLu, a benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Aware Adapter: Towards Learning Adaptive Visual Tokens for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To bridge the gap between vision and language modalities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) usually learn an adapter that converts visual inputs to understandable tokens for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most adapters generate consistent visual tokens, regardless of the specific objects of interest mentioned in the prompt. Since these adapters distribute equal attention to every detail in the image and focus on the entire scene, they may increase the cognitive load for LLMs, particularly when processing complex scenes. To alleviate this problem, we propose prompt-aware adapters. These adapters are designed with the capability to dynamically embed visual inputs based on the specific focus of the prompt. Specifically, prompt-aware adapters utilize both global and local textual features to capture the most relevant visual clues from the prompt at both coarse and fine granularity levels. This approach significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and interpret visual content. Experiments on various visual question answering tasks, such as counting and position reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-aware adapters.</description>

      <title>Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns with a Heightened Citation Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset of 166 papers from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date, encompassing 3,066 references in total. In our experiment, GPT-4 was tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias in GPT-4, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of GPT-4's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended by GPT-4 are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination. Our results underscore the need for identifying the model's biases and for developing balanced methods to interact with LLMs in general.</description>

      <title>Filtered Corpus Training (FiCT) Shows that Language Models can Generalize from Indirect Evidence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Filtered Corpus Training, a method that trains language models (LMs) on corpora with certain linguistic constructions filtered out from the training data, and uses it to measure the ability of LMs to perform linguistic generalization on the basis of indirect evidence. We apply the method to both LSTM and Transformer LMs (of roughly comparable size), developing filtered corpora that target a wide range of linguistic phenomena. Our results show that while transformers are better qua LMs (as measured by perplexity), both models perform equally and surprisingly well on linguistic generalization measures, suggesting that they are capable of generalizing from indirect evidence.</description>

      <title>Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to improve the inference efficiency of an LLM by expanding it into a mixture of sparse experts, where each expert is a copy of the original weights, one-shot pruned for a specific cluster of input values. We call this approach $\textit{Sparse Expansion}$. We show that, for models such as Llama 2 70B, as we increase the number of sparse experts, Sparse Expansion outperforms all other one-shot sparsification approaches for the same inference FLOP budget per token, and that this gap grows as sparsity increases, leading to inference speedups.
  But why? To answer this, we provide strong evidence that the mixture of sparse experts is effectively $\textit{disentangling}$ the input-output relationship of every individual neuron across clusters of inputs. Specifically, sparse experts approximate the dense neuron output distribution with fewer weights by decomposing the distribution into a collection of simpler ones, each with a separate sparse dot product covering it. Interestingly, we show that the Wasserstein distance between a neuron's output distribution and a Gaussian distribution is an indicator of its entanglement level and contribution to the accuracy of the model. Every layer of an LLM has a fraction of highly entangled Wasserstein neurons, and model performance suffers more when these are sparsified as opposed to others.</description>

      <title>InstructAvatar: Text-Guided Emotion and Motion Control for Avatar Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent talking avatar generation models have made strides in achieving realistic and accurate lip synchronization with the audio, but often fall short in controlling and conveying detailed expressions and emotions of the avatar, making the generated video less vivid and controllable. In this paper, we propose a novel text-guided approach for generating emotionally expressive 2D avatars, offering fine-grained control, improved interactivity, and generalizability to the resulting video. Our framework, named InstructAvatar, leverages a natural language interface to control the emotion as well as the facial motion of avatars. Technically, we design an automatic annotation pipeline to construct an instruction-video paired training dataset, equipped with a novel two-branch diffusion-based generator to predict avatars with audio and text instructions at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that InstructAvatar produces results that align well with both conditions, and outperforms existing methods in fine-grained emotion control, lip-sync quality, and naturalness.

      <title>Canonical Variates in Wasserstein Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the classification of instances each characterized not by a singular point, but by a distribution on a vector space. We employ the Wasserstein metric to measure distances between distributions, which are then used by distance-based classification algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, k-means, and pseudo-mixture modeling. Central to our investigation is dimension reduction within the Wasserstein metric space to enhance classification accuracy. We introduce a novel approach grounded in the principle of maximizing Fisher's ratio, defined as the quotient of between-class variation to within-class variation. The directions in which this ratio is maximized are termed discriminant coordinates or canonical variates axes. In practice, we define both between-class and within-class variations as the average squared distances between pairs of instances, with the pairs either belonging to the same class or to different classes. This ratio optimization is achieved through an iterative algorithm, which alternates between optimal transport and maximization steps within the vector space. We conduct empirical studies to assess the algorithm's convergence and, through experimental validation, demonstrate that our dimension reduction technique substantially enhances classification performance. Moreover, our method outperforms well-established algorithms that operate on vector representations derived from distributional data. It also exhibits robustness against variations in the distributional representations of data clouds.</description>

      <title>EconAgent: Large Language Model-Empowered Agents for Simulating Macroeconomic Activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has led to a growing emphasis on data-driven modeling in macroeconomics, with agent-based modeling (ABM) emerging as a prominent bottom-up simulation paradigm. In ABM, agents (e.g., households, firms) interact within a macroeconomic environment, collectively generating market dynamics. Existing agent modeling typically employs predetermined rules or learning-based neural networks for decision-making. However, customizing each agent presents significant challenges, complicating the modeling of agent heterogeneity. Additionally, the influence of multi-period market dynamics and multifaceted macroeconomic factors are often overlooked in decision-making processes. In this work, we introduce EconAgent, a large language model-empowered agent with human-like characteristics for macroeconomic simulation. We first construct a simulation environment that incorporates various market dynamics driven by agents' decisions regarding work and consumption. Through the perception module, we create heterogeneous agents with distinct decision-making mechanisms. Furthermore, we model the impact of macroeconomic trends using a memory module, which allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market dynamics. Simulation experiments show that EconAgent can make realistic decisions, leading to more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena compared to existing rule-based or learning-based agents. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/ACL24-EconAgent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harm reporting in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently operates on an ad hoc basis, lacking a structured process for disclosing or addressing algorithmic flaws. In contrast, the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ethos and ecosystem play a pivotal role in software security and transparency. Globally, there are ongoing efforts to establish frameworks that promote transparency and collaboration in addressing AI-related issues, though challenges persist. Algorithmic flaws in machine learning (ML) models present distinct challenges compared to traditional software vulnerabilities, warranting a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose the implementation of a dedicated Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the intricacies of machine learning and artificial intelligence issues. This paper delves into the historical landscape of disclosures in ML, encompassing the ad hoc reporting of harms and the emergence of participatory auditing. By juxtaposing these practices with the well-established disclosure norms in cybersecurity, we argue that the broader adoption of CFD has the potential to enhance public trust through transparent processes that carefully balance the interests of both organizations and the community.</description>

Abstract: In many real-world planning applications, agents might be interested in finding plans whose actions have costs that are as uniform as possible. Such plans provide agents with a sense of stability and predictability, which are key features when humans are the agents executing plans suggested by planning tools. This paper adapts three uniformity metrics to automated planning, and introduce planning-based compilations that allow to lexicographically optimize sum of action costs and action costs uniformity. Experimental results both in well-known and novel planning benchmarks show that the reformulated tasks can be effectively solved in practice to generate uniform plans.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning framework that employs a transformer model to address the challenges of mixed-integer programs, specifically focusing on the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem (CLSP). Our approach, to our knowledge, is the first to utilize transformers to predict the binary variables of a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. Specifically, our approach harnesses the encoder decoder transformer's ability to process sequential data, making it well-suited for predicting binary variables indicating production setup decisions in each period of the CLSP. This problem is inherently dynamic, and we need to handle sequential decision making under constraints. We present an efficient algorithm in which CLSP solutions are learned through a transformer neural network. The proposed post-processed transformer algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art solver, CPLEX and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in solution time, optimal gap, and percent infeasibility over 240K benchmark CLSP instances tested. After the ML model is trained, conducting inference on the model, reduces the MIP into a linear program (LP). This transforms the ML-based algorithm, combined with an LP solver, into a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve a well-known NP-Hard problem, with almost perfect solution quality.</description>

      <title>Instantiations and Computational Aspects of Non-Flat Assumption-based Argumentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most existing computational tools for assumption-based argumentation (ABA) focus on so-called flat frameworks, disregarding the more general case. In this paper, we study an instantiation-based approach for reasoning in possibly non-flat ABA. We make use of a semantics-preserving translation between ABA and bipolar argumentation frameworks (BAFs). By utilizing compilability theory, we establish that the constructed BAFs will in general be of exponential size. In order to keep the number of arguments and computational cost low, we present three ways of identifying redundant arguments. Moreover, we identify fragments of ABA which admit a poly-sized instantiation. We propose two algorithmic approaches for reasoning in possibly non-flat ABA. The first approach utilizes the BAF instantiation while the second works directly without constructing arguments. An empirical evaluation shows that the former outperforms the latter on many instances, reflecting the lower complexity of BAF reasoning. This result is in contrast to flat ABA, where direct approaches dominate instantiation-based approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Correspondence of Non-flat Assumption-based Argumentation and Logic Programming with Negation as Failure in the Head</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relation between (a fragment of) assumption-based argumentation (ABA) and logic programs (LPs) under stable model semantics is well-studied. However, for obtaining this relation, the ABA framework needs to be restricted to being flat, i.e., a fragment where the (defeasible) assumptions can never be entailed, only assumed to be true or false. Here, we remove this restriction and show a correspondence between non-flat ABA and LPs with negation as failure in their head. We then extend this result to so-called set-stable ABA semantics, originally defined for the fragment of non-flat ABA called bipolar ABA. We showcase how to define set-stable semantics for LPs with negation as failure in their head and show the correspondence to set-stable ABA semantics.</description>

      <title>ALI-Agent: Assessing LLMs' Alignment with Human Values via Agent-based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can elicit unintended and even harmful content when misaligned with human values, posing severe risks to users and society. To mitigate these risks, current evaluation benchmarks predominantly employ expert-designed contextual scenarios to assess how well LLMs align with human values. However, the labor-intensive nature of these benchmarks limits their test scope, hindering their ability to generalize to the extensive variety of open-world use cases and identify rare but crucial long-tail risks. Additionally, these static tests fail to adapt to the rapid evolution of LLMs, making it hard to evaluate timely alignment issues. To address these challenges, we propose ALI-Agent, an evaluation framework that leverages the autonomous abilities of LLM-powered agents to conduct in-depth and adaptive alignment assessments. ALI-Agent operates through two principal stages: Emulation and Refinement. During the Emulation stage, ALI-Agent automates the generation of realistic test scenarios. In the Refinement stage, it iteratively refines the scenarios to probe long-tail risks. Specifically, ALI-Agent incorporates a memory module to guide test scenario generation, a tool-using module to reduce human labor in tasks such as evaluating feedback from target LLMs, and an action module to refine tests. Extensive experiments across three aspects of human values--stereotypes, morality, and legality--demonstrate that ALI-Agent, as a general evaluation framework, effectively identifies model misalignment. Systematic analysis also validates that the generated test scenarios represent meaningful use cases, as well as integrate enhanced measures to probe long-tail risks.

Abstract: Intelligent tutors have shown success in delivering a personalized and adaptive learning experience. However, there exist challenges regarding the granularity of knowledge in existing frameworks and the resulting instructions they can provide. To address these issues, we propose HTN-based tutors, a new intelligent tutoring framework that represents expert models using Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs). Like other tutoring frameworks, it allows flexible encoding of different problem-solving strategies while providing the additional benefit of a hierarchical knowledge organization. We leverage the latter to create tutors that can adapt the granularity of their scaffolding. This organization also aligns well with the compositional nature of skills.</description>

Abstract: Many populous countries including India are burdened with a considerable backlog of legal cases. Development of automated systems that could process legal documents and augment legal practitioners can mitigate this. However, there is a dearth of high-quality corpora that is needed to develop such data-driven systems. The problem gets even more pronounced in the case of low resource languages such as Hindi. In this resource paper, we introduce the Hindi Legal Documents Corpus (HLDC), a corpus of more than 900K legal documents in Hindi. Documents are cleaned and structured to enable the development of downstream applications. Further, as a use-case for the corpus, we introduce the task of bail prediction. We experiment with a battery of models and propose a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based model for the same. MTL models use summarization as an auxiliary task along with bail prediction as the main task. Experiments with different models are indicative of the need for further research in this area. We release the corpus and model implementation code with this paper: https://github.com/Exploration-Lab/HLDC</description>

      <title>Ask-AC: An Initiative Advisor-in-the-Loop Actor-Critic Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising results achieved, state-of-the-art interactive reinforcement learning schemes rely on passively receiving supervision signals from advisor experts, in the form of either continuous monitoring or pre-defined rules, which inevitably result in a cumbersome and expensive learning process. In this paper, we introduce a novel initiative advisor-in-the-loop actor-critic framework, termed as Ask-AC, that replaces the unilateral advisor-guidance mechanism with a bidirectional learner-initiative one, and thereby enables a customized and efficacious message exchange between learner and advisor. At the heart of Ask-AC are two complementary components, namely action requester and adaptive state selector, that can be readily incorporated into various discrete actor-critic architectures. The former component allows the agent to initiatively seek advisor intervention in the presence of uncertain states, while the latter identifies the unstable states potentially missed by the former especially when environment changes, and then learns to promote the ask action on such states. Experimental results on both stationary and non-stationary environments and across different actor-critic backbones demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the learning efficiency of the agent, and achieves the performances on par with those obtained by continuous advisor monitoring.</description>

      <title>GOTCHA: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), the integrity of online video interactions has become a growing concern. RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans and a new automated scoring function, leading to 88.6% and 80.1% AUC, respectively. The findings underscore the promising potential of challenge-response systems for explainable and scalable real-time deepfake detection in practical scenarios. We provide access to data and code at \url{https://github.com/mittalgovind/GOTCHA-Deepfakes}.</description>

      <title>RFold: RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Decoupled Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is more stable and accessible in the cell than its tertiary structure, making it essential for functional prediction. Although deep learning has shown promising results in this field, current methods suffer from poor generalization and high complexity. In this work, we reformulate the RNA secondary structure prediction as a K-Rook problem, thereby simplifying the prediction process into probabilistic matching within a finite solution space. Building on this innovative perspective, we introduce RFold, a simple yet effective method that learns to predict the most matching K-Rook solution from the given sequence. RFold employs a bi-dimensional optimization strategy that decomposes the probabilistic matching problem into row-wise and column-wise components to reduce the matching complexity, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art approaches. The code and Colab demo are available in \href{http://github.com/A4Bio/RFold}{http://github.com/A4Bio/RFold}.</description>

      <title>ACPO: A Policy Optimization Algorithm for Average MDPs with Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00808v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) for constrained MDPs (CMDPs) is an increasingly important problem for various applications. Often, the average criterion is more suitable than the discounted criterion. Yet, RL for average-CMDPs (ACMDPs) remains a challenging problem. Algorithms designed for discounted constrained RL problems often do not perform well for the average CMDP setting. In this paper, we introduce a new policy optimization with function approximation algorithm for constrained MDPs with the average criterion. The Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm is inspired by trust region-based policy optimization algorithms. We develop basic sensitivity theory for average CMDPs, and then use the corresponding bounds in the design of the algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees on its performance, and through extensive experimental work in various challenging OpenAI Gym environments, show its superior empirical performance when compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms adapted for the ACMDPs.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Reprompting, an iterative sampling algorithm that automatically learns the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) recipes for a given task without human intervention. Through Gibbs sampling, Reprompting infers the CoT recipes that work consistently well for a set of training samples by iteratively sampling new recipes using previously sampled recipes as parent prompts to solve other training problems. We conduct extensive experiments on 20 challenging reasoning tasks. Results show that Reprompting outperforms human-written CoT prompts substantially by +9.4 points on average. It also achieves consistently better performance than the state-of-the-art prompt optimization and decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>On the Weight Dynamics of Deep Normalized Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that high disparities in effective learning rates (ELRs) across layers in deep neural networks can negatively affect trainability. We formalize how these disparities evolve over time by modeling weight dynamics (evolution of expected gradient and weight norms) of networks with normalization layers, predicting the evolution of layer-wise ELR ratios. We prove that when training with any constant learning rate, ELR ratios converge to 1, despite initial gradient explosion. We identify a ``critical learning rate" beyond which ELR disparities widen, which only depends on current ELRs. To validate our findings, we devise a hyper-parameter-free warm-up method that successfully minimizes ELR spread quickly in theory and practice. Our experiments link ELR spread with trainability, a relationship that is most evident in very deep networks with significant gradient magnitude excursions.</description>

      <title>PandaLM: An Automatic Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Instruction Tuning Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instruction tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task, owing to the complexity of hyperparameter selection and the difficulty involved in evaluating the tuned models. To determine the optimal hyperparameters, an automatic, robust, and reliable evaluation benchmark is essential. However, establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges associated with evaluation accuracy and privacy protection. In response to these challenges, we introduce a judge large language model, named PandaLM, which is trained to distinguish the superior model given several LLMs. PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses, which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75% of GPT-3.5's evaluation ability and 88.28% of GPT-4's in terms of F1-score on our test dataset. PandaLM enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to their counterparts trained with default Alpaca's hyperparameters. In addition, PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data leakage. All resources of PandaLM are released at https://github.com/WeOpenML/PandaLM.</description>

      <title>Data-Copilot: Bridging Billions of Data and Humans with Autonomous Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07209v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industries such as finance, meteorology, and energy generate vast amounts of data daily. Efficiently managing, processing, and displaying this data requires specialized expertise and is often tedious and repetitive. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to develop an automated workflow presents a highly promising solution. However, LLMs are not adept at handling complex numerical computations and table manipulations and are also constrained by a limited context budget. Based on this, we propose Data-Copilot, a data analysis agent that autonomously performs querying, processing, and visualization of massive data tailored to diverse human requests. The advancements are twofold: First, it is a code-centric agent that receives human requests and generates code as an intermediary to handle massive data, which is quite flexible for large-scale data processing tasks. Second, Data-Copilot involves a data exploration phase in advance, which explores how to design more universal and error-free interfaces for real-time response. Specifically, it actively explores data sources, discovers numerous common requests, and abstracts them into many universal interfaces for daily invocation. When deployed in real-time requests, Data-Copilot only needs to invoke these pre-designed interfaces, transforming raw data into visualized outputs (e.g., charts, tables) that best match the user's intent. Compared to generating code from scratch, invoking these pre-designed and compiler-validated interfaces can significantly reduce errors during real-time requests. Additionally, interface workflows are more efficient and offer greater interpretability than code. We open-sourced Data-Copilot with massive Chinese financial data, such as stocks, funds, and news, demonstrating promising application prospects.</description>

Abstract: Information access systems, such as search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants, have become integral to our daily lives as they help us satisfy our information needs. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these systems presents a long-standing and complex scientific challenge. This challenge is rooted in the difficulty of assessing a system's overall effectiveness in assisting users to complete tasks through interactive support, and further exacerbated by the substantial variation in user behaviour and preferences. To address this challenge, user simulation emerges as a promising solution.
  This book focuses on providing a thorough understanding of user simulation techniques designed specifically for evaluation purposes. We begin with a background of information access system evaluation and explore the diverse applications of user simulation. Subsequently, we systematically review the major research progress in user simulation, covering both general frameworks for designing user simulators, utilizing user simulation for evaluation, and specific models and algorithms for simulating user interactions with search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. Realizing that user simulation is an interdisciplinary research topic, whenever possible, we attempt to establish connections with related fields, including machine learning, dialogue systems, user modeling, and economics. We end the book with a detailed discussion of important future research directions, many of which extend beyond the evaluation of information access systems and are expected to have broader impact on how to evaluate interactive intelligent systems in general.</description>

      <title>TACO: Temporal Latent Action-Driven Contrastive Loss for Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) from raw pixel data, sample inefficiency continues to present a substantial obstacle. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by creating self-supervised auxiliary tasks, aiming to enrich the agent's learned representations with control-relevant information for future state prediction. However, these objectives are often insufficient to learn representations that can represent the optimal policy or value function, and they often consider tasks with small, abstract discrete action spaces and thus overlook the importance of action representation learning in continuous control. In this paper, we introduce TACO: Temporal Action-driven Contrastive Learning, a simple yet powerful temporal contrastive learning approach that facilitates the concurrent acquisition of latent state and action representations for agents. TACO simultaneously learns a state and an action representation by optimizing the mutual information between representations of current states paired with action sequences and representations of the corresponding future states. Theoretically, TACO can be shown to learn state and action representations that encompass sufficient information for control, thereby improving sample efficiency. For online RL, TACO achieves 40% performance boost after one million environment interaction steps on average across nine challenging visual continuous control tasks from Deepmind Control Suite. In addition, we show that TACO can also serve as a plug-and-play module adding to existing offline visual RL methods to establish the new state-of-the-art performance for offline visual RL across offline datasets with varying quality.</description>

      <title>Decomposition-based Hierarchical Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past research into robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, notably Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), was largely based on a single formula for individual or groups of robots. But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~\cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is used to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks. Our approach was experimentally applied to domains of navigation and manipulation. The simulation demonstrated that our approach can find better solutions using less runtimes.</description>

      <title>Critical Learning Periods Emerge Even in Deep Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical learning periods are periods early in development where temporary sensory deficits can have a permanent effect on behavior and learned representations. Despite the radical differences between biological and artificial networks, critical learning periods have been empirically observed in both systems. This suggests that critical periods may be fundamental to learning and not an accident of biology. Yet, why exactly critical periods emerge in deep networks is still an open question, and in particular it is unclear whether the critical periods observed in both systems depend on particular architectural or optimization details. To isolate the key underlying factors, we focus on deep linear network models, and show that, surprisingly, such networks also display much of the behavior seen in biology and artificial networks, while being amenable to analytical treatment. We show that critical periods depend on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution. We also show analytically and in simulations that the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. Finally, we extend our analysis to multi-task learning to show that pre-training on certain tasks can damage the transfer performance on new tasks, and show how this depends on the relationship between tasks and the duration of the pre-training stage. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first analytically tractable model that sheds light into why critical learning periods emerge in biological and artificial networks.</description>

      <title>Timely Fusion of Surround Radar/Lidar for Object Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusing Radar and Lidar sensor data can fully utilize their complementary advantages and provide more accurate reconstruction of the surrounding for autonomous driving systems. Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed of surround Radar, and thus the frequency to generate Radar data frames, is much lower than surround Lidar. Existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems.This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art object detection model MVDNet. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of input data. We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments.</description>

      <title>Bias Testing and Mitigation in LLM-based Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic code generation models play a pivotal role in enhancing the productivity of software development procedures. As the adoption of LLMs becomes more widespread in software coding ecosystems, a pressing issue has emerged: does the generated code contain social bias and unfairness, such as those related to age, gender, and race? This issue concerns the integrity, fairness, and ethical foundation of software applications that depend on the code generated by these models, yet is under-explored in the literature. This paper presents a novel bias testing framework that is specifically designed for code generation tasks. Based on this framework, we conduct an extensive evaluation of the bias in code generated by five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal that 20.29% to 44.93% code functions generated by the models under study are biased when handling bias sensitive tasks (i.e., tasks that involve sensitive attributes such as age and gender). This indicates that the existing LLMs can be unfair in code generation, posing risks of unintended and harmful software behaviors. To mitigate bias for code generation models, we evaluate five bias mitigation prompt strategies, i.e., utilizing bias testing results to refine the code (zero-shot), one-, few-shot, and two Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Our evaluation results illustrate that these strategies are all effective in mitigating bias. Overall, one-shot and few-shot learning are the two most effective. For GPT-4, 80% to 90% code bias can be removed with one-shot learning.</description>

      <title>Identifiability Matters: Revealing the Hidden Recoverable Condition in Unbiased Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to train unbiased ranking models from biased click logs, by explicitly modeling a generation process for user behavior and fitting click data based on examination hypothesis. Previous research found empirically that the true latent relevance is mostly recoverable through click fitting. However, we demonstrate that this is not always achievable, resulting in a significant reduction in ranking performance. This research investigates the conditions under which relevance can be recovered from click data in the first principle. We initially characterize a ranking model as identifiable if it can recover the true relevance up to a scaling transformation, a criterion sufficient for the pairwise ranking objective. Subsequently, we investigate an equivalent condition for identifiability, articulated as a graph connectivity test problem: the recovery of relevance is feasible if and only if the identifiability graph (IG), derived from the underlying structure of the dataset, is connected. The presence of a disconnected IG may lead to degenerate cases and suboptimal ranking performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce two methods, namely node intervention and node merging, designed to modify the dataset and restore the connectivity of the IG. Empirical results derived from a simulated dataset and two real-world LTR benchmark datasets not only validate our proposed theory but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in alleviating data bias when the relevance model is unidentifiable.</description>

      <title>HyperMask: Adaptive Hypernetwork-based Masks for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting when they are sequentially trained on multiple tasks. Many continual learning (CL) strategies are trying to overcome this problem. One of the most effective is the hypernetwork-based approach. The hypernetwork generates the weights of a target model based on the task's identity. The model's main limitation is that, in practice, the hypernetwork can produce completely different architectures for subsequent tasks. To solve such a problem, we use the lottery ticket hypothesis, which postulates the existence of sparse subnetworks, named winning tickets, that preserve the performance of a whole network. In the paper, we propose a method called HyperMask, which dynamically filters a target network depending on the CL task. The hypernetwork produces semi-binary masks to obtain dedicated target subnetworks. Moreover, due to the lottery ticket hypothesis, we can use a single network with weighted subnets. Depending on the task, the importance of some weights may be dynamically enhanced while others may be weakened. HyperMask achieves competitive results in several CL datasets and, in some scenarios, goes beyond the state-of-the-art scores, both with derived and unknown task identities.</description>

      <title>Perfect Alignment May be Poisonous to Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) aims to learn node representations by aligning positive pairs and separating negative ones. However, few of researchers have focused on the inner law behind specific augmentations used in graph-based learning. What kind of augmentation will help downstream performance, how does contrastive learning actually influence downstream tasks, and why the magnitude of augmentation matters so much? This paper seeks to address these questions by establishing a connection between augmentation and downstream performance. Our findings reveal that GCL contributes to downstream tasks mainly by separating different classes rather than gathering nodes of the same class. So perfect alignment and augmentation overlap which draw all intra-class samples the same can not fully explain the success of contrastive learning. Therefore, in order to understand how augmentation aids the contrastive learning process, we conduct further investigations into the generalization, finding that perfect alignment that draw positive pair the same could help contrastive loss but is poisonous to generalization, as a result, perfect alignment may not lead to best downstream performance, so specifically designed augmentation is needed to achieve appropriate alignment performance and improve downstream accuracy. We further analyse the result by information theory and graph spectrum theory and propose two simple but effective methods to verify the theories. The two methods could be easily applied to various GCL algorithms and extensive experiments are conducted to prove its effectiveness.

      <title>Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</description>

      <title>Posterior Sampling-based Online Learning for Episodic POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in POMDPs is known to be significantly harder than MDPs. In this paper, we consider the online learning problem for episodic POMDPs with unknown transition and observation models. We propose a Posterior Sampling-based reinforcement learning algorithm for POMDPs (PS4POMDPs), which is much simpler and more implementable compared to state-of-the-art optimism-based online learning algorithms for POMDPs. We show that the Bayesian regret of the proposed algorithm scales as the square root of the number of episodes, matching the lower bound, and is polynomial in the other parameters. In a general setting, its regret scales exponentially in the horizon length $H$, and we show that this is inevitable by providing a lower bound. However, when the POMDP is undercomplete and weakly revealing (a common assumption in the recent literature), we establish a polynomial Bayesian regret bound. We finally propose a posterior sampling algorithm for multi-agent POMDPs, and show it too has sublinear regret.</description>

      <title>Just Ask One More Time! Self-Agreement Improves Reasoning of Language Models in (Almost) All Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting combined with language models has achieved encouraging results on complex reasoning tasks, the naive greedy decoding used in CoT prompting usually causes the repetitiveness and local optimality. To address this shortcoming, ensemble-optimization tries to obtain multiple reasoning paths to get the final answer assembly. However, current ensemble-optimization methods either simply employ rule-based post-processing such as \textit{self-consistency}, or train an additional model based on several task-related human annotations to select the best one among multiple reasoning paths, yet fail to generalize to realistic settings where the type of input questions is unknown or the answer format of reasoning paths is unknown. To avoid their limitations, we propose \textbf{Self-Agreement}, a generalizable ensemble-optimization method applying in almost all scenarios where the type of input questions and the answer format of reasoning paths may be known or unknown. Self-agreement firstly samples from language model's decoder to generate a \textit{diverse} set of reasoning paths, and subsequently prompts the language model \textit{one more time} to determine the optimal answer by selecting the most \textit{agreed} answer among the sampled reasoning paths. Self-agreement simultaneously achieves remarkable performance on six public reasoning benchmarks and superior generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Mirage: An RNS-Based Photonic Accelerator for DNN Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic computing is a compelling avenue for performing highly efficient matrix multiplication, a crucial operation in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). While this method has shown great success in DNN inference, meeting the high precision demands of DNN training proves challenging due to the precision limitations imposed by costly data converters and the analog noise inherent in photonic hardware. This paper proposes Mirage, a photonic DNN training accelerator that overcomes the precision challenges in photonic hardware using the Residue Number System (RNS). RNS is a numeral system based on modular arithmetic, allowing us to perform high-precision operations via multiple low-precision modular operations. In this work, we present a novel micro-architecture and dataflow for an RNS-based photonic tensor core performing modular arithmetic in the analog domain. By combining RNS and photonics, Mirage provides high energy efficiency without compromising precision and can successfully train state-of-the-art DNNs achieving accuracy comparable to FP32 training. Our study shows that on average across several DNNs when compared to systolic arrays, Mirage achieves more than $23.8\times$ faster training and $32.1\times$ lower EDP in an iso-energy scenario and consumes $42.8\times$ lower power with comparable or better EDP in an iso-area scenario.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Semi-supervised Machine Learning with Surrogate Safety Measures for Abnormal Driving Behavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04610v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting abnormal driving behavior is critical for road traffic safety and the evaluation of drivers' behavior. With the advancement of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the accumulation of naturalistic driving data, many ML models have been adopted for abnormal driving behavior detection. Most existing ML-based detectors rely on (fully) supervised ML methods, which require substantial labeled data. However, ground truth labels are not always available in the real world, and labeling large amounts of data is tedious. Thus, there is a need to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised methods to make the anomaly detection process more feasible and efficient. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes large-scale real-world data revealing several abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., sudden acceleration, rapid lane-changing) and develops a Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM) based semi-supervised ML method using partly labeled data to accurately detect the identified abnormal driving behaviors. Moreover, previous ML-based approaches predominantly utilize basic vehicle motion features (such as velocity and acceleration) to label and detect abnormal driving behaviors, while this study seeks to introduce Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) as the input features for ML models to improve the detection performance. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised ML model with the introduced SSMs serving as important features. The proposed semi-supervised ML method outperforms other baseline semi-supervised or unsupervised methods regarding various metrics, e.g., delivering the best accuracy at 99.58% and the best F-1 measure at 0.9913. The ablation study further highlights the significance of SSMs for advancing detection performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advances of the artificial intelligence, building social intelligence remains a challenge. Among social signals, laughter is one of the distinctive expressions that occurs during social interactions between humans. In this work, we tackle a new challenge for machines to understand the rationale behind laughter in video, Video Laugh Reasoning. We introduce this new task to explain why people laugh in a particular video and a dataset for this task. Our proposed dataset, SMILE, comprises video clips and language descriptions of why people laugh. We propose a baseline by leveraging the reasoning capacity of large language models (LLMs) with textual video representation. Experiments show that our baseline can generate plausible explanations for laughter. We further investigate the scalability of our baseline by probing other video understanding tasks and in-the-wild videos. We release our dataset, code, and model checkpoints on https://github.com/postech-ami/SMILE-Dataset.</description>

      <title>ConfusionPrompt: Practical Private Inference for Online Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are commonly deployed as online services, necessitating users to transmit informative prompts to cloud servers, thus engendering substantial privacy concerns. In response, we present ConfusionPrompt, a novel private LLM inference framework designed to obfuscate the server by: (i) decomposing the prompt into sub-prompts, and (ii) generating pseudo prompts along with the genuine sub-prompts as input to the online LLM. Eventually, the returned responses can be recomposed by the user to obtain the final whole response. Such designs endows our framework with advantages over previous protocols that (i) it can be seamlessly integrated with existing black-box LLMs, and (ii) it achieves significantly better privacy-utility trade-off than existing text perturbation-based methods. We develop a $(\lambda, \mu, \rho)$-privacy model to formulate the requirement for a privacy-preserving group of prompts, and provide a complexity analysis, affirming ConfusionPrompt's efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our method offers significantly higher utility compared to local inference methods using open-source models and perturbation-based techniques, while also requiring much less memory than open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Fast Sampling Through The Reuse Of Attention Maps In Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for flexible and realistic image synthesis. Nevertheless, these models rely on a time-consuming sampling procedure, which has motivated attempts to reduce their latency. When improving efficiency, researchers often use the original diffusion model to train an additional network designed specifically for fast image generation. In contrast, our approach seeks to reduce latency directly, without any retraining, fine-tuning, or knowledge distillation. In particular, we find the repeated calculation of attention maps to be costly yet redundant, and instead suggest reusing them during sampling. Our specific reuse strategies are based on ODE theory, which implies that the later a map is reused, the smaller the distortion in the final image. We empirically compare these reuse strategies with few-step sampling procedures of comparable latency, finding that reuse generates images that are closer to those produced by the original high-latency diffusion model.</description>

Abstract: Robot learning tasks are extremely compute-intensive and hardware-specific. Thus the avenues of tackling these challenges, using a diverse dataset of offline demonstrations that can be used to train robot manipulation agents, is very appealing. The Train-Offline-Test-Online (TOTO) Benchmark provides a well-curated open-source dataset for offline training comprised mostly of expert data and also benchmark scores of the common offline-RL and behaviour cloning agents. In this paper, we introduce DiffClone, an offline algorithm of enhanced behaviour cloning agent with diffusion-based policy learning, and measured the efficacy of our method on real online physical robots at test time. This is also our official submission to the Train-Offline-Test-Online (TOTO) Benchmark Challenge organized at NeurIPS 2023. We experimented with both pre-trained visual representation and agent policies. In our experiments, we find that MOCO finetuned ResNet50 performs the best in comparison to other finetuned representations. Goal state conditioning and mapping to transitions resulted in a minute increase in the success rate and mean-reward. As for the agent policy, we developed DiffClone, a behaviour cloning agent improved using conditional diffusion.</description>

      <title>Towards Principled Graph Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph learning architectures based on the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (k-WL) hierarchy offer a theoretically well-understood expressive power. However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the k-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has at least 3-WL expressive power. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings.

      <title>BlockFusion: Expandable 3D Scene Generation using Latent Tri-plane Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present BlockFusion, a diffusion-based model that generates 3D scenes as unit blocks and seamlessly incorporates new blocks to extend the scene. BlockFusion is trained using datasets of 3D blocks that are randomly cropped from complete 3D scene meshes. Through per-block fitting, all training blocks are converted into the hybrid neural fields: with a tri-plane containing the geometry features, followed by a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for decoding the signed distance values. A variational auto-encoder is employed to compress the tri-planes into the latent tri-plane space, on which the denoising diffusion process is performed. Diffusion applied to the latent representations allows for high-quality and diverse 3D scene generation. To expand a scene during generation, one needs only to append empty blocks to overlap with the current scene and extrapolate existing latent tri-planes to populate new blocks. The extrapolation is done by conditioning the generation process with the feature samples from the overlapping tri-planes during the denoising iterations. Latent tri-plane extrapolation produces semantically and geometrically meaningful transitions that harmoniously blend with the existing scene. A 2D layout conditioning mechanism is used to control the placement and arrangement of scene elements. Experimental results indicate that BlockFusion is capable of generating diverse, geometrically consistent and unbounded large 3D scenes with unprecedented high-quality shapes in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.</description>

      <title>Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, capable of performing a broad range of actions, such as invoking tools and controlling robots, show great potential in tackling real-world challenges. LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python code to consolidate LLM agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug.</description>

      <title>Conditional Normalizing Flows for Active Learning of Coarse-Grained Molecular Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling of the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is a long-standing challenge. Recently, instead of generating long molecular dynamics simulations, generative machine learning methods such as normalizing flows have been used to learn the Boltzmann distribution directly, without samples. However, this approach is susceptible to mode collapse and thus often does not explore the full configurational space. In this work, we address this challenge by separating the problem into two levels, the fine-grained and coarse-grained degrees of freedom. A normalizing flow conditioned on the coarse-grained space yields a probabilistic connection between the two levels. To explore the configurational space, we employ coarse-grained simulations with active learning which allows us to update the flow and make all-atom potential energy evaluations only when necessary. Using alanine dipeptide as an example, we show that our methods obtain a speedup to molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 15.9 to 216.2 compared to the speedup of 4.5 of the current state-of-the-art machine learning approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing meta-parameters (i.e., hyperparameters) in machine learning algorithms, a critical factor influencing training efficiency and model performance. Moving away from the computationally expensive traditional meta-parameter search methods, we introduce MetaOptimize framework that dynamically adjusts meta-parameters, particularly step sizes (also known as learning rates), during training. More specifically, MetaOptimize can wrap around any first-order optimization algorithm, tuning step sizes on the fly to minimize a specific form of regret that accounts for long-term effect of step sizes on training, through a discounted sum of future losses. We also introduce low complexity variants of MetaOptimize that, in conjunction with its adaptability to multiple optimization algorithms, demonstrate performance competitive to those of best hand-crafted learning rate schedules across various machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Decoding-time Realignment of Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences is crucial for reducing errors and biases in these models. Alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are typically cast as optimizing a tradeoff between human preference rewards and a proximity regularization term that encourages staying close to the unaligned model. Selecting an appropriate level of regularization is critical: insufficient regularization can lead to reduced model capabilities due to reward hacking, whereas excessive regularization hinders alignment. Traditional methods for finding the optimal regularization level require retraining multiple models with varying regularization strengths. This process, however, is resource-intensive, especially for large models. To address this challenge, we propose decoding-time realignment (DeRa), a simple method to explore and evaluate different regularization strengths in aligned models without retraining. DeRa enables control over the degree of alignment, allowing users to smoothly transition between unaligned and aligned models. It also enhances the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by enabling the identification of effective regularization strengths using a validation dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05967v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art deep learning generative models that are trained on the principle of learning forward and backward diffusion processes via the progressive addition of noise and denoising. In this paper, we aim to fool audio-based DNN models, such as those from the Hugging Face framework, primarily those that focus on audio, in particular transformer-based artificial intelligence models, which are powerful machine learning models that save time and achieve results faster and more efficiently. We demonstrate the feasibility of backdoor attacks (called `BacKBayDiffMod`) on audio transformers derived from Hugging Face, a popular framework in the world of artificial intelligence research. The backdoor attack developed in this paper is based on poisoning model training data uniquely by incorporating backdoor diffusion sampling and a Bayesian approach to the distribution of poisoned data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Premier-TACO, a multitask feature representation learning approach designed to improve few-shot policy learning efficiency in sequential decision-making tasks. Premier-TACO leverages a subset of multitask offline datasets for pretraining a general feature representation, which captures critical environmental dynamics and is fine-tuned using minimal expert demonstrations. It advances the temporal action contrastive learning (TACO) objective, known for state-of-the-art results in visual control tasks, by incorporating a novel negative example sampling strategy. This strategy is crucial in significantly boosting TACO's computational efficiency, making large-scale multitask offline pretraining feasible. Our extensive empirical evaluation in a diverse set of continuous control benchmarks including Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and LIBERO demonstrate Premier-TACO's effectiveness in pretraining visual representations, significantly enhancing few-shot imitation learning of novel tasks. Our code, pretraining data, as well as pretrained model checkpoints will be released at https://github.com/PremierTACO/premier-taco.

      <title>A self-supervised framework for learning whole slide representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole slide imaging is fundamental to biomedical microscopy and computational pathology. Previously, learning representations for gigapixel-sized whole slide images (WSIs) has relied on multiple instance learning with weak labels, which do not annotate the diverse morphologic features and spatial heterogeneity of WSIs. A high-quality self-supervised learning method for WSIs would provide transferable visual representations for downstream computational pathology tasks, without the need for dense annotations. We present Slide Pre-trained Transformers (SPT) for gigapixel-scale self-supervision of WSIs. Treating WSI patches as tokens, SPT combines data transformation strategies from language and vision modeling into a general and unified framework to generate views of WSIs for self-supervised pretraining. SPT leverages the inherent regional heterogeneity, histologic feature variability, and information redundancy within WSIs to learn high-quality whole slide representations. We benchmark SPT visual representations on five diagnostic tasks across three biomedical microscopy datasets. SPT significantly outperforms baselines for histopathologic diagnosis, cancer subtyping, and genetic mutation prediction. Finally, we demonstrate that SPT consistently improves whole slide representations when using off-the-shelf, in-domain, and foundational patch encoders for whole slide multiple instance learning.</description>

      <title>VerMCTS: Synthesizing Multi-Step Programs using a Verifier, a Large Language Model, and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate useful code, but often the code they generate cannot be trusted to be sound. In this paper, we present VerMCTS, an approach to begin to resolve this issue by generating verified programs in Dafny and Coq. VerMCTS uses a logical verifier in concert with an LLM to guide a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach leverages the verifier to gain intermediate feedback inside the search algorithm by checking partial programs at each step to estimate an upper bound on the value function. To measure the performance of VerMCTS, we develop a new suite of multi-step verified programming problems in Dafny and Coq. In terms of pass@T, a new metric which computes the pass rate given a budget of T tokens sampled from the LLM, VerMCTS leads to more than a 30% absolute increase in average pass@5000 across the suite over repeated sampling from the base language model. Our code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/namin/llm-verified-with-monte-carlo-tree-search .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a new approach for distributional reinforcement learning which elucidates a clean separation of transition structure and reward in the learning process. Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our distributional successor measure (SM) describes the distributional consequences of this behaviour. We formulate the distributional SM as a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting it with distributional and model-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose an algorithm that learns the distributional SM from data by minimizing a two-level maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state. As an illustration of the usefulness of the distributional SM, we show that it enables zero-shot risk-sensitive policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible.</description>

      <title>Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10207v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</description>

Abstract: We present a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) workflow combining a symbolic-based learning technique with a large language model (LLM) agent to generate synthetic data for code comment classification in the C programming language. We also show how generating controlled synthetic data using this workflow fixes some of the notable weaknesses of LLM-based generation and increases the performance of classical machine learning models on the code comment classification task. Our best model, a Neural Network, achieves a Macro-F1 score of 91.412% with an increase of 1.033% after data augmentation.</description>

      <title>DecisionNCE: Embodied Multimodal Representations via Implicit Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal pretraining is an effective strategy for the trinity of goals of representation learning in autonomous robots: 1) extracting both local and global task progressions; 2) enforcing temporal consistency of visual representation; 3) capturing trajectory-level language grounding. Most existing methods approach these via separate objectives, which often reach sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a universal unified objective that can simultaneously extract meaningful task progression information from image sequences and seamlessly align them with language instructions. We discover that via implicit preferences, where a visual trajectory inherently aligns better with its corresponding language instruction than mismatched pairs, the popular Bradley-Terry model can transform into representation learning through proper reward reparameterizations. The resulted framework, DecisionNCE, mirrors an InfoNCE-style objective but is distinctively tailored for decision-making tasks, providing an embodied representation learning framework that elegantly extracts both local and global task progression features, with temporal consistency enforced through implicit time contrastive learning, while ensuring trajectory-level instruction grounding via multimodal joint encoding. Evaluation on both simulated and real robots demonstrates that DecisionNCE effectively facilitates diverse downstream policy learning tasks, offering a versatile solution for unified representation and reward learning.

      <title>How do Large Language Models Handle Multilingualism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse languages. This study explores how LLMs handle multilingualism. Based on observed language ratio shifts among layers and the relationships between network structures and certain capabilities, we hypothesize the LLM's multilingual workflow ($\texttt{MWork}$): LLMs initially understand the query, converting multilingual inputs into English for task-solving. In the intermediate layers, they employ English for thinking and incorporate multilingual knowledge with self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. In the final layers, LLMs generate responses aligned with the original language of the query. To verify $\texttt{MWork}$, we introduce Parallel Language-specific Neuron Detection ($\texttt{PLND}$) to identify activated neurons for inputs in different languages without any labeled data. Using $\texttt{PLND}$, we validate $\texttt{MWork}$ through extensive experiments involving the deactivation of language-specific neurons across various layers and structures. Moreover, $\texttt{MWork}$ allows fine-tuning of language-specific neurons with a small dataset, enhancing multilingual abilities in a specific language without compromising others. This approach results in an average improvement of $3.6\%$ for high-resource languages and $2.3\%$ for low-resource languages across all tasks with just $400$ documents.</description>

      <title>SynGhost: Imperceptible and Universal Task-agnostic Backdoor Attack in Pre-trained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training has been a necessary phase for deploying pre-trained language models (PLMs) to achieve remarkable performance in downstream tasks. However, we empirically show that backdoor attacks exploit such a phase as a vulnerable entry point for task-agnostic. In this paper, we first propose $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filtering defense, to prove that existing task-agnostic backdoors are easily exposed, due to explicit triggers used. Then, we present $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an imperceptible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack in PLMs. Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ hostilely manipulates clean samples through different syntactic and then maps the backdoor to representation space without disturbing the primitive representation. $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ further leverages contrastive learning to achieve universal, which performs a uniform distribution of backdoors in the representation space. In light of the syntactic properties, we also introduce an awareness module to alleviate the interference between different syntactic. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ holds more serious threats. Not only do severe harmfulness to various downstream tasks on two tuning paradigms but also to any PLMs. Meanwhile, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ is imperceptible against three countermeasures based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and the proposed $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$.</description>

      <title>Ada-Tracker: Soft Tissue Tracking via Inter-Frame and Adaptive-Template Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft tissue tracking is crucial for computer-assisted interventions. Existing approaches mainly rely on extracting discriminative features from the template and videos to recover corresponding matches. However, it is difficult to adopt these techniques in surgical scenes, where tissues are changing in shape and appearance throughout the surgery. To address this problem, we exploit optical flow to naturally capture the pixel-wise tissue deformations and adaptively correct the tracked template. Specifically, we first implement an inter-frame matching mechanism to extract a coarse region of interest based on optical flow from consecutive frames. To accommodate appearance change and alleviate drift, we then propose an adaptive-template matching method, which updates the tracked template based on the reliability of the estimates. Our approach, Ada-Tracker, enjoys both short-term dynamics modeling by capturing local deformations and long-term dynamics modeling by introducing global temporal compensation. We evaluate our approach on the public SurgT benchmark, which is generated from Hamlyn, SCARED, and Kidney boundary datasets. The experimental results show that Ada-Tracker achieves superior accuracy and performs more robustly against prior works. Code is available at https://github.com/wrld/Ada-Tracker.</description>

      <title>TRAWL: External Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendation with LLM Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining semantic information with behavioral data is a crucial research area in recommender systems. A promising approach involves leveraging external knowledge to enrich behavioral-based recommender systems with abundant semantic information. However, this approach faces two primary challenges: denoising raw external knowledge and adapting semantic representations. To address these challenges, we propose an External Knowledge-Enhanced Recommendation method with LLM Assistance (TRAWL). This method utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract relevant recommendation knowledge from raw external data and employs a contrastive learning strategy for adapter training. Experiments on public datasets and real-world online recommender systems validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical NeuroSymbolic Approach for Comprehensive and Explainable Action Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action quality assessment (AQA) applies computer vision to quantitatively assess the performance or execution of a human action. Current AQA approaches are end-to-end neural models, which lack transparency and tend to be biased because they are trained on subjective human judgements as ground-truth. To address these issues, we introduce a neuro-symbolic paradigm for AQA, which uses neural networks to abstract interpretable symbols from video data and makes quality assessments by applying rules to those symbols. We take diving as the case study. We found that domain experts prefer our system and find it more informative than purely neural approaches to AQA in diving. Our system also achieves state-of-the-art action recognition and temporal segmentation, and automatically generates a detailed report that breaks the dive down into its elements and provides objective scoring with visual evidence. As verified by a group of domain experts, this report may be used to assist judges in scoring, help train judges, and provide feedback to divers.

      <title>Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (same data, same method) and replicate (different data or method) the models described in Nguyen et al., 2021 to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in Nguyen et al.,2021 and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. The success of the reproduction was assessed using different criteria. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 &gt; 0), which is consistent with its findings. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.</description>

      <title>Robust Diffusion Models for Adversarial Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) based adversarial purification (AP) has shown to be the most powerful alternative to adversarial training (AT). However, these methods neglect the fact that pre-trained diffusion models themselves are not robust to adversarial attacks as well. Additionally, the diffusion process can easily destroy semantic information and generate a high quality image but totally different from the original input image after the reverse process, leading to degraded standard accuracy. To overcome these issues, a natural idea is to harness adversarial training strategy to retrain or fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model, which is computationally prohibitive. We propose a novel robust reverse process with adversarial guidance, which is independent of given pre-trained DMs and avoids retraining or fine-tuning the DMs. This robust guidance can not only ensure to generate purified examples retaining more semantic content but also mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off of DMs for the first time, which also provides DM-based AP an efficient adaptive ability to new attacks. Extensive experiments are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results and exhibits generalization against different attacks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Key Mechanisms of Factual Recall in Transformer-Based Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into several mechanisms employed by Transformer-based language models (LLMs) for factual recall tasks. We outline a pipeline consisting of three major steps: (1) Given a prompt ``The capital of France is,'' task-specific attention heads extract the topic token, such as ``France,'' from the context and pass it to subsequent MLPs. (2) As attention heads' outputs are aggregated with equal weight and added to the residual stream, the subsequent MLP acts as an ``activation,'' which either erases or amplifies the information originating from individual heads. As a result, the topic token ``France'' stands out in the residual stream. (3) A deep MLP takes ``France'' and generates a component that redirects the residual stream towards the direction of the correct answer, i.e., ``Paris.'' This procedure is akin to applying an implicit function such as ``get\_capital($X$),'' and the argument $X$ is the topic token information passed by attention heads. To achieve the above quantitative and qualitative analysis for MLPs, we proposed a novel analytic method aimed at decomposing the outputs of the MLP into components understandable by humans. Additionally, we observed a universal anti-overconfidence mechanism in the final layer of models, which suppresses correct predictions. We mitigate this suppression by leveraging our interpretation to improve factual recall confidence. The above interpretations are evaluated across diverse tasks spanning various domains of factual knowledge, using various language models from the GPT-2 families, 1.3B OPT, up to 7B Llama-2, and in both zero- and few-shot setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm -- Dynamics Learning and predictive control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA) -- for Parameterized Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs). The agent learns a parameterized-action-conditioned dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control. We theoretically quantify the difference between the generated trajectory and the optimal trajectory during planning in terms of the value they achieved through the lens of Lipschitz Continuity. Our empirical results on several standard benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance than state-of-the-art PAMDP methods.</description>

      <title>WorDepth: Variational Language Prior for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single image is an ill-posed problem with inherent ambiguities, i.e. scale. Predicting a 3D scene from text description(s) is similarly ill-posed, i.e. spatial arrangements of objects described. We investigate the question of whether two inherently ambiguous modalities can be used in conjunction to produce metric-scaled reconstructions. To test this, we focus on monocular depth estimation, the problem of predicting a dense depth map from a single image, but with an additional text caption describing the scene. To this end, we begin by encoding the text caption as a mean and standard deviation; using a variational framework, we learn the distribution of the plausible metric reconstructions of 3D scenes corresponding to the text captions as a prior. To "select" a specific reconstruction or depth map, we encode the given image through a conditional sampler that samples from the latent space of the variational text encoder, which is then decoded to the output depth map. Our approach is trained alternatingly between the text and image branches: in one optimization step, we predict the mean and standard deviation from the text description and sample from a standard Gaussian, and in the other, we sample using a (image) conditional sampler. Once trained, we directly predict depth from the encoded text using the conditional sampler. We demonstrate our approach on indoor (NYUv2) and outdoor (KITTI) scenarios, where we show that language can consistently improve performance in both.</description>

      <title>Score identity Distillation: Exponentially Fast Distillation of Pretrained Diffusion Models for One-Step Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets, the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step, data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation.

      <description>arXiv:2404.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using UAVs for wildlife observation and motion capture offers manifold advantages for studying animals in the wild, especially grazing herds in open terrain. The aerial perspective allows observation at a scale and depth that is not possible on the ground, offering new insights into group behavior. However, the very nature of wildlife field-studies puts traditional fixed wing and multi-copter systems to their limits: limited flight time, noise and safety aspects affect their efficacy, where lighter than air systems can remain on station for many hours. Nevertheless, airships are challenging from a ground handling perspective as well as from a control point of view, being voluminous and highly affected by wind. In this work, we showcase a system designed to use airship formations to track, follow, and visually record wild horses from multiple angles, including airship design, simulation, control, on board computer vision, autonomous operation and practical aspects of field experiments.</description>

      <title>Ctrl-Adapter: An Efficient and Versatile Framework for Adapting Diverse Controls to Any Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ControlNets are widely used for adding spatial control to text-to-image diffusion models with different conditions, such as depth maps, scribbles/sketches, and human poses. However, when it comes to controllable video generation, ControlNets cannot be directly integrated into new backbones due to feature space mismatches, and training ControlNets for new backbones can be a significant burden for many users. Furthermore, applying ControlNets independently to different frames cannot effectively maintain object temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce Ctrl-Adapter, an efficient and versatile framework that adds diverse controls to any image/video diffusion model through the adaptation of pretrained ControlNets. Ctrl-Adapter offers strong and diverse capabilities, including image and video control, sparse-frame video control, fine-grained patch-level multi-condition control (via an MoE router), zero-shot adaptation to unseen conditions, and supports a variety of downstream tasks beyond spatial control, including video editing, video style transfer, and text-guided motion control. With six diverse U-Net/DiT-based image/video diffusion models (SDXL, PixArt-$\alpha$, I2VGen-XL, SVD, Latte, Hotshot-XL), Ctrl-Adapter matches the performance of pretrained ControlNets on COCO and achieves the state-of-the-art on DAVIS 2017 with significantly lower computation (&lt; 10 GPU hours).</description>

      <title>Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench). Moreover, we also introduce phi-3-vision, a 4.2 billion parameter model based on phi-3-mini with strong reasoning capabilities for image and text prompts.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models to Enrich the Documentation of Datasets for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent regulatory initiatives like the European AI Act and relevant voices in the Machine Learning (ML) community stress the need to describe datasets along several key dimensions for trustworthy AI, such as the provenance processes and social concerns. However, this information is typically presented as unstructured text in accompanying documentation, hampering their automated analysis and processing. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLM) and a set of prompting strategies to automatically extract these dimensions from documents and enrich the dataset description with them. Our approach could aid data publishers and practitioners in creating machine-readable documentation to improve the discoverability of their datasets, assess their compliance with current AI regulations, and improve the overall quality of ML models trained on them.
  In this paper, we evaluate the approach on 12 scientific dataset papers published in two scientific journals (Nature's Scientific Data and Elsevier's Data in Brief) using two different LLMs (GPT3.5 and Flan-UL2). Results show good accuracy with our prompt extraction strategies. Concrete results vary depending on the dimensions, but overall, GPT3.5 shows slightly better accuracy (81,21%) than FLAN-UL2 (69,13%) although it is more prone to hallucinations. We have released an open-source tool implementing our approach and a replication package, including the experiments' code and results, in an open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Make-it-Real: Unleashing Large Multimodal Model for Painting 3D Objects with Realistic Materials</title>

Abstract: Physically realistic materials are pivotal in augmenting the realism of 3D assets across various applications and lighting conditions. However, existing 3D assets and generative models often lack authentic material properties. Manual assignment of materials using graphic software is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we exploit advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly GPT-4V, to present a novel approach, Make-it-Real: 1) We demonstrate that GPT-4V can effectively recognize and describe materials, allowing the construction of a detailed material library. 2) Utilizing a combination of visual cues and hierarchical text prompts, GPT-4V precisely identifies and aligns materials with the corresponding components of 3D objects. 3) The correctly matched materials are then meticulously applied as reference for the new SVBRDF material generation according to the original albedo map, significantly enhancing their visual authenticity. Make-it-Real offers a streamlined integration into the 3D content creation workflow, showcasing its utility as an essential tool for developers of 3D assets.</description>

      <title>Soft Preference Optimization: Aligning Language Models to Expert Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Soft Preference Optimization (SPO), a method for aligning generative models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), with human preferences, without the need for a reward model. SPO optimizes model outputs directly over a preference dataset through a natural loss function that integrates preference loss with a regularization term across the model's entire output distribution rather than limiting it to the preference dataset. Although SPO does not require the assumption of an existing underlying reward model, we demonstrate that, under the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, it converges to a softmax of scaled rewards, with the distribution's "softness" adjustable via the softmax exponent, an algorithm parameter. We showcase SPO's methodology, its theoretical foundation, and its comparative advantages in simplicity, computational efficiency, and alignment precision.</description>

      <title>Less is More: on the Over-Globalizing Problem in Graph Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformer, due to its global attention mechanism, has emerged as a new tool in dealing with graph-structured data. It is well recognized that the global attention mechanism considers a wider receptive field in a fully connected graph, leading many to believe that useful information can be extracted from all the nodes. In this paper, we challenge this belief: does the globalizing property always benefit Graph Transformers? We reveal the over-globalizing problem in Graph Transformer by presenting both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, i.e., the current attention mechanism overly focuses on those distant nodes, while the near nodes, which actually contain most of the useful information, are relatively weakened. Then we propose a novel Bi-Level Global Graph Transformer with Collaborative Training (CoBFormer), including the inter-cluster and intra-cluster Transformers, to prevent the over-globalizing problem while keeping the ability to extract valuable information from distant nodes. Moreover, the collaborative training is proposed to improve the model's generalization ability with a theoretical guarantee. Extensive experiments on various graphs well validate the effectiveness of our proposed CoBFormer.</description>

      <title>MANTIS: Interleaved Multi-Image Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great results in single-image vision language tasks. However, their abilities to solve multi-image visual language tasks is yet to be improved. The existing LMMs like OpenFlamingo, Emu2, Idefics gain their multi-image ability through pre-training on hundreds of millions of noisy interleaved image-text data from the web, which is neither efficient nor effective. In this paper, we aim to build strong multi-image LMMs via instruction tuning with academic-level resources. Therefore, we meticulously construct Mantis-Instruct containing 721K multi-image instruction data to train a family of models Mantis. The instruction tuning empowers Mantis with different multi-image skills like co-reference, comparison, reasoning, and temporal understanding. We evaluate Mantis on five multi-image benchmarks and seven single-image benchmarks. Mantis-SigLIP can achieve SoTA results on all the multi-image benchmarks and beat the strongest multi-image baseline, Idefics2-8B by an average of 11 absolute points. Notably, Idefics2-8B was pre-trained on 140M interleaved multi-image data, which is 200x larger than Mantis-Instruct. We observe that Mantis performs equivalently well on the held-in and held-out benchmarks, which shows its generalization ability. Notably, we found that Mantis can even match the performance of GPT-4V on multi-image benchmarks. We further evaluate Mantis on single-image benchmarks and demonstrate that Mantis also maintains a strong single-image performance on par with CogVLM and Emu2. Our results show that multi-image abilities are not necessarily gained through massive pre-training, instead, it can be gained by the low-cost instruction tuning. Our work provides new perspectives on how to improve LMMs' multi-image abilities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Q-Learning with Large Language Model Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making tasks but often requires extensive sampling to achieve significant improvements. While reward shaping can enhance learning efficiency, non-potential-based methods introduce biases that affect performance, and potential-based reward shaping, though unbiased, lacks the ability to provide heuristics for state-action pairs, limiting its effectiveness in complex environments. Large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning for simpler tasks, but they suffer from low inference speeds and occasional hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided Q-learning}, a framework that leverages LLMs as heuristics to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach adapts to hallucinations, improves sample efficiency, and avoids biasing final performance. Experimental results show that our algorithm is general, robust, and capable of preventing ineffective exploration.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek-V2: A Strong, Economical, and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04434v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DeepSeek-V2, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model characterized by economical training and efficient inference. It comprises 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and supports a context length of 128K tokens. DeepSeek-V2 adopts innovative architectures including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. MLA guarantees efficient inference through significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector, while DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an economical cost through sparse computation. Compared with DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves 42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times. We pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on a high-quality and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens, and further perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fully unlock its potential. Evaluation results show that, even with only 21B activated parameters, DeepSeek-V2 and its chat versions still achieve top-tier performance among open-source models.</description>

      <title>Towards Geometry-Aware Pareto Set Learning for Neural Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problems are prevalent in various real-world applications. Most existing neural MOCO methods rely on problem decomposition to transform an MOCO problem into a series of singe-objective combinatorial optimization (SOCO) problems. However, these methods often approximate partial regions of the Pareto front and spend excessive time on diversity enhancement because of ambiguous decomposition and time-consuming precise hypervolume calculation. To address these limitations, we design a Geometry-Aware Pareto set Learning algorithm named GAPL, which provides a novel geometric perspective for neural MOCO via a Pareto attention model based on hypervolume expectation maximization. In addition, we propose a hypervolume residual update strategy to enable the Pareto attention model to capture both local and non-local information of the Pareto set/front. We also design a novel inference approach to further improve quality of the solution set and speed up hypervolume calculation. Experimental results on three classic MOCO problems demonstrate that our GAPL outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines via superior decomposition and efficient diversity enhancement.</description>

      <title>Mask-based Invisible Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved unprecedented performance in the domain of object detection, resulting in breakthroughs in areas such as autonomous driving and security. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks prompt models to behave similarly to standard models without a trigger; however, they act maliciously upon detecting a predefined trigger. Despite extensive research on backdoor attacks in image classification, their application to object detection remains relatively underexplored. Given the widespread application of object detection in critical real-world scenarios, the sensitivity and potential impact of these vulnerabilities cannot be overstated. In this study, we propose an effective invisible backdoor attack on object detection utilizing a mask-based approach. Three distinct attack scenarios were explored for object detection: object disappearance, object misclassification, and object generation attack. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively examined the effectiveness of these attacks and tested certain defense methods to determine effective countermeasures.</description>

      <title>DEBATE: Devil's Advocate-Based Assessment and Text Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As natural language generation (NLG) models have become prevalent, systematically assessing the quality of machine-generated texts has become increasingly important. Recent studies introduce LLM-based evaluators that operate as reference-free metrics, demonstrating their capability to adeptly handle novel tasks. However, these models generally rely on a single-agent approach, which, we argue, introduces an inherent limit to their performance. This is because there exist biases in LLM agent's responses, including preferences for certain text structure or content. In this work, we propose DEBATE, an NLG evaluation framework based on multi-agent scoring system augmented with a concept of Devil's Advocate. Within the framework, one agent is instructed to criticize other agents' arguments, potentially resolving the bias in LLM agent's answers. DEBATE substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in two meta-evaluation benchmarks in NLG evaluation, SummEval and TopicalChat. We also show that the extensiveness of debates among agents and the persona of an agent can influence the performance of evaluators.</description>

      <title>PDE Control Gym: A Benchmark for Data-Driven Boundary Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.</description>

      <title>Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis at https://github.com/ApolloResearch/e2e_sae</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the crucial importance of accelerating text generation in large language models (LLMs) for efficiently producing content, the sequential nature of this process often leads to high inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Various techniques have been proposed and developed to address these challenges and improve efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of accelerated generation techniques in autoregressive language models, aiming to understand the state-of-the-art methods and their applications. We categorize these techniques into several key areas: speculative decoding, early exiting mechanisms, and non-autoregressive methods. We discuss each category's underlying principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements. Through this survey, we aim to offer insights into the current landscape of techniques in LLMs and provide guidance for future research directions in this critical area of natural language processing.</description>

Abstract: The assessment of bias within Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical concern in the contemporary discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of their potential impact on societal dynamics. Especially, recognizing and considering political bias within LLM applications is central when closing in on the tipping point toward performative prediction. Then, being educated about potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can drive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In this way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political bias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct or assistant models) concerning political issues within the European Union (EU) from a German voter's perspective. To do so, we use the "Wahl-O-Mat", a voting advice application used in Germany. From the voting advice of the "Wahl-O-Mat" we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with German political parties. We show that larger models, such as Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties, while smaller models often remain neutral, particularly when prompted in English. The central finding is, that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in the alignment with respect to a specific party. Our findings underline the importance of rigorously assessing and making bias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities of performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine learning prediction and language generation.</description>

      <title>MeteoRA: Multiple-tasks Embedded LoRA for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pretrain+fine-tune paradigm is foundational in deploying large language models (LLMs) across a diverse range of downstream applications. Among these, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), producing numerous off-the-shelf task-specific LoRA adapters. However, this approach requires explicit task intention selection, posing challenges for automatic task sensing and switching during inference with multiple existing LoRA adapters embedded in a single LLM. In this work, we introduce MeteoRA (Multiple-Tasks embedded LoRA), a scalable multi-knowledge LoRA fusion framework designed for LLMs. MeteoRA integrates various LoRA adapters in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style into the base LLM, enabling the model to automatically select the most pertinent adapter based on the task input. This advancement significantly enhances the LLM's capability to handle composite tasks that require different adapters to solve various components of the problem. Our evaluations, featuring the LlaMA2-13B and LlaMA3-8B base models equipped with off-the-shelf 28 LoRA adapters through MeteoRA, demonstrate equivalent performance with the individual adapters. Furthermore, both base models equipped with MeteoRA achieve superior performance in sequentially solving composite tasks with ten problems in only a single inference process, highlighting the ability of timely intention switching in MeteoRA embedded LLMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trend and Periodicity: Guiding Time Series Forecasting with Textual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel Text-Guided Time Series Forecasting (TGTSF) task. By integrating textual cues, such as channel descriptions and dynamic news, TGTSF addresses the critical limitations of traditional methods that rely purely on historical data. To support this task, we propose TGForecaster, a robust baseline model that fuses textual cues and time series data using cross-attention mechanisms. We then present four meticulously curated benchmark datasets to validate the proposed framework, ranging from simple periodic data to complex, event-driven fluctuations. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TGForecaster consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the transformative potential of incorporating textual information into time series forecasting. This work not only pioneers a novel forecasting task but also establishes a new benchmark for future research, driving advancements in multimodal data integration for time series models.</description>

      <title>Curriculum Direct Preference Optimization for Diffusion and Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an effective and efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum learning for text-to-image generation. Our method is divided into two training stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency) model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches on three benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Curriculum-DPO-EE14.</description>

      <title>ComboStoc: Combinatorial Stochasticity for Diffusion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an under-explored but important factor of diffusion generative models, i.e., the combinatorial complexity. Data samples are generally high-dimensional, and for various structured generation tasks, there are additional attributes which are combined to associate with data samples. We show that the space spanned by the combination of dimensions and attributes is insufficiently sampled by existing training scheme of diffusion generative models, causing degraded test time performance. We present a simple fix to this problem by constructing stochastic processes that fully exploit the combinatorial structures, hence the name ComboStoc. Using this simple strategy, we show that network training is significantly accelerated across diverse data modalities, including images and 3D structured shapes. Moreover, ComboStoc enables a new way of test time generation which uses insynchronized time steps for different dimensions and attributes, thus allowing for varying degrees of control over them.</description>

      <title>CG-FedLLM: How to Compress Gradients in Federated Fune-tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive training data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized Learning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.</description>

      <title>No Filter: Cultural and Socioeconomic Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by - and even at odds with - the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generation of Image Sequence and Application in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In 3D and dynamic MRI, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies.</description>

      <title>PoseCrafter: One-Shot Personalized Video Synthesis Following Flexible Pose Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PoseCrafter, a one-shot method for personalized video generation following the control of flexible poses. Built upon Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, we carefully design an inference process to produce high-quality videos without the corresponding ground-truth frames. First, we select an appropriate reference frame from the training video and invert it to initialize all latent variables for generation. Then, we insert the corresponding training pose into the target pose sequences to enhance faithfulness through a trained temporal attention module. Furthermore, to alleviate the face and hand degradation resulting from discrepancies between poses of training videos and inference poses, we implement simple latent editing through an affine transformation matrix involving facial and hand landmarks. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that PoseCrafter achieves superior results to baselines pre-trained on a vast collection of videos under 8 commonly used metrics. Besides, PoseCrafter can follow poses from different individuals or artificial edits and simultaneously retain the human identity in an open-domain training video. Our project page is available at https://ml-gsai.github.io/PoseCrafter-demo/.</description>
