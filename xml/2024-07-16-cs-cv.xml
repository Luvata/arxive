      <title>Data Adaptive Traceback for Vision-Language Foundation Models in Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have been incredibly successful in a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks using adaptation methods. However, due to the high cost of obtaining pre-training datasets, pairs with weak image-text correlation in the data exist in large numbers. We call them weak-paired samples. Due to the limitations of these weak-paired samples, the pre-training model are unable to mine all the knowledge from pre-training data. The existing adaptation methods do not consider the missing knowledge, which may lead to crucial task-related knowledge for the downstream tasks being ignored. To address this issue, we propose a new adaptation framework called Data Adaptive Traceback (DAT). Specifically, we utilize a zero-shot-based method to extract the most downstream task-related subset of the pre-training data to enable the downstream tasks. Furthermore, we adopt a pseudo-label-based semi-supervised technique to reuse the pre-training images and a vision-language contrastive learning method to address the confirmation bias issue in semi-supervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments that show our proposed DAT approach meaningfully improves various benchmark datasets performance over traditional adaptation methods by simply.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Neural Radiance Fields for Crime Scene Video Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to review and determine the feasibility of using variations of NeRF models in order to reconstruct crime scenes given input videos of the scene. We focus on three main innovations of NeRF when it comes to reconstructing crime scenes: Multi-object Synthesis, Deformable Synthesis, and Lighting. From there, we analyse its innovation progress against the requirements to be met in order to be able to reconstruct crime scenes with given videos of such scenes.</description>

      <title>Local Clustering for Lung Cancer Image Classification via Sparse Solution Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to use a local clustering approach based on the sparse solution technique to study the medical image, especially the lung cancer image classification task. We view images as the vertices in a weighted graph and the similarity between a pair of images as the edges in the graph. The vertices within the same cluster can be assumed to share similar features and properties, thus making the applications of graph clustering techniques very useful for image classification. Recently, the approach based on the sparse solutions of linear systems for graph clustering has been found to identify clusters more efficiently than traditional clustering methods such as spectral clustering. We propose to use the two newly developed local clustering methods based on sparse solution of linear system for image classification. In addition, we employ a box spline-based tight-wavelet-framelet method to clean these images and help build a better adjacency matrix before clustering. The performance of our methods is shown to be very effective in classifying images. Our approach is significantly more efficient and either favorable or equally effective compared with other state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we shall make a remark by pointing out two image deformation methods to build up more artificial image data to increase the number of labeled images.</description>

      <title>DG-PIC: Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning for Point Cloud Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent point cloud understanding research suffers from performance drops on unseen data, due to the distribution shifts across different domains. While recent studies use Domain Generalization (DG) techniques to mitigate this by learning domain-invariant features, most are designed for a single task and neglect the potential of testing data. Despite In-Context Learning (ICL) showcasing multi-task learning capability, it usually relies on high-quality context-rich data and considers a single dataset, and has rarely been studied in point cloud understanding. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practical, multi-domain multi-task setting, handling multiple domains and multiple tasks within one unified model for domain generalized point cloud understanding. To this end, we propose Domain Generalized Point-In-Context Learning (DG-PIC) that boosts the generalizability across various tasks and domains at testing time. In particular, we develop dual-level source prototype estimation that considers both global-level shape contextual and local-level geometrical structures for representing source domains and a dual-level test-time feature shifting mechanism that leverages both macro-level domain semantic information and micro-level patch positional relationships to pull the target data closer to the source ones during the testing. Our DG-PIC does not require any model updates during the testing and can handle unseen domains and multiple tasks, \textit{i.e.,} point cloud reconstruction, denoising, and registration, within one unified model. We also introduce a benchmark for this new setting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DG-PIC outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale gridded Gabor attention for cirrus segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of segmenting global contaminants in large images. The precise delineation of such structures requires ample global context alongside understanding of textural patterns. CNNs specialise in the latter, though their ability to generate global features is limited. Attention measures long range dependencies in images, capturing global context, though at a large computational cost. We propose a gridded attention mechanism to address this limitation, greatly increasing efficiency by processing multi-scale features into smaller tiles. We also enhance the attention mechanism for increased sensitivity to texture orientation, by measuring correlations across features dependent on different orientations, in addition to channel and positional attention. We present results on a new dataset of astronomical images, where the task is segmenting large contaminating dust clouds.</description>

      <title>Single-Image Shadow Removal Using Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow removal aims at restoring the image content within shadow regions, pursuing a uniform distribution of illumination that is consistent between shadow and non-shadow regions. {Comparing to other image restoration tasks, there are two unique challenges in shadow removal:} 1) The patterns of shadows are arbitrary, varied, and often have highly complex trace structures, making ``trace-less'' image recovery difficult. 2) The degradation caused by shadows is spatially non-uniform, resulting in inconsistencies in illumination and color between shadow and non-shadow areas. Recent developments in this field are primarily driven by deep learning-based solutions, employing a variety of learning strategies, network architectures, loss functions, and training data. Nevertheless, a thorough and insightful review of deep learning-based shadow removal techniques is still lacking. In this paper, we are the first to provide a comprehensive survey to cover various aspects ranging from technical details to applications. We highlight the major advancements in deep learning-based single-image shadow removal methods, thoroughly review previous research across various categories, and provide insights into the historical progression of these developments. Additionally, we summarize performance comparisons both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond the technical aspects of shadow removal methods, we also explore potential future directions for this field.</description>

      <title>Visual Multi-Object Tracking with Re-Identification and Occlusion Handling using Labeled Random Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an online visual multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithm that resolves object appearance-reappearance and occlusion. Our solution is based on the labeled random finite set (LRFS) filtering approach, which in principle, addresses disappearance, appearance, reappearance, and occlusion via a single Bayesian recursion. However, in practice, existing numerical approximations cause reappearing objects to be initialized as new tracks, especially after long periods of being undetected. In occlusion handling, the filter's efficacy is dictated by trade-offs between the sophistication of the occlusion model and computational demand. Our contribution is a novel modeling method that exploits object features to address reappearing objects whilst maintaining a linear complexity in the number of detections. Moreover, to improve the filter's occlusion handling, we propose a fuzzy detection model that takes into consideration the overlapping areas between tracks and their sizes. We also develop a fast version of the filter to further reduce the computational time.</description>

      <title>DegustaBot: Zero-Shot Visual Preference Estimation for Personalized Multi-Object Rearrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: De gustibus non est disputandum ("there is no accounting for others' tastes") is a common Latin maxim describing how many solutions in life are determined by people's personal preferences. Many household tasks, in particular, can only be considered fully successful when they account for personal preferences such as the visual aesthetic of the scene. For example, setting a table could be optimized by arranging utensils according to traditional rules of Western table setting decorum, without considering the color, shape, or material of each object, but this may not be a completely satisfying solution for a given person. Toward this end, we present DegustaBot, an algorithm for visual preference learning that solves household multi-object rearrangement tasks according to personal preference. To do this, we use internet-scale pre-trained vision-and-language foundation models (VLMs) with novel zero-shot visual prompting techniques. To evaluate our method, we collect a large dataset of naturalistic personal preferences in a simulated table-setting task, and conduct a user study in order to develop two novel metrics for determining success based on personal preference. This is a challenging problem and we find that 50% of our model's predictions are likely to be found acceptable by at least 20% of people.</description>

      <title>TractGraphFormer: Anatomically Informed Hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer Network for Classification from Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between brain connections and non-imaging phenotypes is increasingly studied using deep neural networks. However, the local and global properties of the brain's white matter networks are often overlooked in convolutional network design. We introduce TractGraphFormer, a hybrid Graph CNN-Transformer deep learning framework tailored for diffusion MRI tractography. This model leverages local anatomical characteristics and global feature dependencies of white matter structures. The Graph CNN module captures white matter geometry and grey matter connectivity to aggregate local features from anatomically similar white matter connections, while the Transformer module uses self-attention to enhance global information learning. Additionally, TractGraphFormer includes an attention module for interpreting predictive white matter connections. In sex prediction tests, TractGraphFormer shows strong performance in large datasets of children (n=9345) and young adults (n=1065). Overall, our approach suggests that widespread connections in the WM are predictive of the sex of an individual, and consistent predictive anatomical tracts are identified across the two datasets. The proposed approach highlights the potential of integrating local anatomical information and global feature dependencies to improve prediction performance in machine learning with diffusion MRI tractography.</description>

      <title>Manipulating a Tetris-Inspired 3D Video Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Synopsis is a technique that performs video compression in a way that preserves the activity in the video. This technique is particularly useful in surveillance and monitoring applications. Although it is still a nascent field of research, there have been several approaches proposed over the last two decades varying with the application, optimization type, nature of data feed, etc. The primary data required for these algorithms arises from some sort of object tracking method. In this paper, we discuss different spatio-temporal data representations suitable for different applications. We also present a formal definition for the video synopsis algorithm. We further discuss the assumptions and modifications to this definition required for a simpler version of the problem. We explore the application of a packing algorithm to solve the problem of video synopsis. Since the nature of the data is three dimensional, we consider 3D packing problems in the discussion. This paper also provides an extensive literature review of different video synopsis methods and packing problems. Lastly, we examine the different applications of this algorithm and how the different data representations discussed earlier can make the problem simpler. We also discuss the future directions of research that can be explored following this discussion.</description>

      <title>AirSketch: Generative Motion to Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.</description>

      <title>Are They the Same Picture? Adapting Concept Bottleneck Models for Human-AI Collaboration in Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image retrieval plays a pivotal role in applications from wildlife conservation to healthcare, for finding individual animals or relevant images to aid diagnosis. Although deep learning techniques for image retrieval have advanced significantly, their imperfect real-world performance often necessitates including human expertise. Human-in-the-loop approaches typically rely on humans completing the task independently and then combining their opinions with an AI model in various ways, as these models offer very little interpretability or \textit{correctability}. To allow humans to intervene in the AI model instead, thereby saving human time and effort, we adapt the Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and propose \texttt{CHAIR}. \texttt{CHAIR} (a) enables humans to correct intermediate concepts, which helps \textit{improve} embeddings generated, and (b) allows for flexible levels of intervention that accommodate varying levels of human expertise for better retrieval. To show the efficacy of \texttt{CHAIR}, we demonstrate that our method performs better than similar models on image retrieval metrics without any external intervention. Furthermore, we also showcase how human intervention helps further improve retrieval performance, thereby achieving human-AI complementarity.</description>

      <title>KGpose: Keypoint-Graph Driven End-to-End Multi-Object 6D Pose Estimation via Point-Wise Pose Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents KGpose, a novel end-to-end framework for 6D pose estimation of multiple objects. Our approach combines keypoint-based method with learnable pose regression through `keypoint-graph', which is a graph representation of the keypoints. KGpose first estimates 3D keypoints for each object using an attentional multi-modal feature fusion of RGB and point cloud features. These keypoints are estimated from each point of point cloud and converted into a graph representation. The network directly regresses 6D pose parameters for each point through a sequence of keypoint-graph embedding and local graph embedding which are designed with graph convolutions, followed by rotation and translation heads. The final pose for each object is selected from the candidates of point-wise predictions. The method achieves competitive results on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. KGpose enables multi-object pose estimation without requiring an extra localization step, offering a unified and efficient solution for understanding geometric contexts in complex scenes for robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Global-Local Collaborative Inference with LLM for Lidar-Based Open-Vocabulary Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) is the task of detecting all interesting objects in a given scene without predefined object classes. Extensive work has been done to deal with the OVD for 2D RGB images, but the exploration of 3D OVD is still limited. Intuitively, lidar point clouds provide 3D information, both object level and scene level, to generate trustful detection results. However, previous lidar-based OVD methods only focus on the usage of object-level features, ignoring the essence of scene-level information. In this paper, we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Scheme (GLIS) for the lidar-based OVD task, which contains a local branch to generate object-level detection result and a global branch to obtain scene-level global feature. With the global-local information, a Large Language Model (LLM) is applied for chain-of-thought inference, and the detection result can be refined accordingly. We further propose Reflected Pseudo Labels Generation (RPLG) to generate high-quality pseudo labels for supervision and Background-Aware Object Localization (BAOL) to select precise object proposals. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate the superiority of our methods. Code is released at https://github.com/GradiusTwinbee/GLIS.</description>

      <title>LightenDiffusion: Unsupervised Low-Light Image Enhancement with Latent-Retinex Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based unsupervised framework that incorporates physically explainable Retinex theory with diffusion models for low-light image enhancement, named LightenDiffusion. Specifically, we present a content-transfer decomposition network that performs Retinex decomposition within the latent space instead of image space as in previous approaches, enabling the encoded features of unpaired low-light and normal-light images to be decomposed into content-rich reflectance maps and content-free illumination maps. Subsequently, the reflectance map of the low-light image and the illumination map of the normal-light image are taken as input to the diffusion model for unsupervised restoration with the guidance of the low-light feature, where a self-constrained consistency loss is further proposed to eliminate the interference of normal-light content on the restored results to improve overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on publicly available real-world benchmarks show that the proposed LightenDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised competitors and is comparable to supervised methods while being more generalizable to various scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/JianghaiSCU/LightenDiffusion.</description>

Abstract: Generative models hold promise for revolutionizing medical education, robot-assisted surgery, and data augmentation for medical AI development. Diffusion models can now generate realistic images from text prompts, while recent advancements have demonstrated their ability to create diverse, high-quality videos. However, these models often struggle with generating accurate representations of medical procedures and detailed anatomical structures. This paper introduces Bora, the first spatio-temporal diffusion probabilistic model designed for text-guided biomedical video generation. Bora leverages Transformer architecture and is pre-trained on general-purpose video generation tasks. It is fine-tuned through model alignment and instruction tuning using a newly established medical video corpus, which includes paired text-video data from various biomedical fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish such a comprehensive annotated biomedical video dataset. Bora is capable of generating high-quality video data across four distinct biomedical domains, adhering to medical expert standards and demonstrating consistency and diversity. This generalist video generative model holds significant potential for enhancing medical consultation and decision-making, particularly in resource-limited settings. Additionally, Bora could pave the way for immersive medical training and procedure planning. Extensive experiments on distinct medical modalities such as endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, and cell tracking validate the effectiveness of our model in understanding biomedical instructions and its superior performance across subjects compared to state-of-the-art generation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of face animation is to generate dynamic and expressive talking head videos from a single reference face, utilizing driving conditions derived from either video or audio inputs. Current approaches often require fine-tuning for specific identities and frequently fail to produce expressive videos due to the limited effectiveness of Wav2Pose modules. To facilitate the generation of one-shot and more consecutive talking head videos, we refine an existing Image2Video model by integrating a Face Locator and Motion Frame mechanism. We subsequently optimize the model using extensive human face video datasets, significantly enhancing its ability to produce high-quality and expressive talking head videos. Additionally, we develop a demo platform using the Gradio framework, which streamlines the process, enabling users to quickly create customized talking head videos.</description>

      <title>Exploring Richer and More Accurate Information via Frequency Selection for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from their corrupted counterparts. Many existing methods primarily focus on the spatial domain, neglecting the understanding of frequency variations and ignoring the impact of implicit noise in skip connections. In this paper, we introduce a multi-scale frequency selection network (MSFSNet) that seamlessly integrates spatial and frequency domain knowledge, selectively recovering richer and more accurate information. Specifically, we initially capture spatial features and input them into dynamic filter selection modules (DFS) at different scales to integrate frequency knowledge. DFS utilizes learnable filters to generate high and low-frequency information and employs a frequency cross-attention mechanism (FCAM) to determine the most information to recover. To learn a multi-scale and accurate set of hybrid features, we develop a skip feature fusion block (SFF) that leverages contextual features to discriminatively determine which information should be propagated in skip-connections. It is worth noting that our DFS and SFF are generic plug-in modules that can be directly employed in existing networks without any adjustments, leading to performance improvements. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks demonstrate that our MSFSNet achieves performance that is either superior or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lite-SAM Is Actually What You Need for Segment Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Lite-SAM, an efficient end-to-end solution for the SegEvery task designed to reduce computational costs and redundancy. Lite-SAM is composed of four main components: a streamlined CNN-Transformer hybrid encoder (LiteViT), an automated prompt proposal network (AutoPPN), a traditional prompt encoder, and a mask decoder. All these components are integrated within the SAM framework. Our LiteViT, a high-performance lightweight backbone network, has only 1.16M parameters, which is a 23% reduction compared to the lightest existing backbone network Shufflenet. We also introduce AutoPPN, an innovative end-to-end method for prompt boxes and points generation. This is an improvement over traditional grid search sampling methods, and its unique design allows for easy integration into any SAM series algorithm, extending its usability. we have thoroughly benchmarked Lite-SAM across a plethora of both public and private datasets. The evaluation encompassed a broad spectrum of universal metrics, including the number of parameters, SegEvery execution time, and accuracy. The findings reveal that Lite-SAM, operating with a lean 4.2M parameters, significantly outpaces its counterparts, demonstrating performance improvements of 43x, 31x, 20x, 21x, and 1.6x over SAM, MobileSAM, Edge-SAM, EfficientViT-SAM, and MobileSAM-v2 respectively, all the while maintaining competitive accuracy. This underscores Lite-SAM's prowess in achieving an optimal equilibrium between performance and precision, thereby setting a new state-of-the-art(SOTA) benchmark in the domain.</description>

      <title>LAPT: Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning for OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for model reliability, as it identifies samples from unknown classes and reduces errors due to unexpected inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP are emerging as powerful tools for OOD detection by integrating multi-modal information. However, the practical application of such systems is challenged by manual prompt engineering, which demands domain expertise and is sensitive to linguistic nuances. In this paper, we introduce Label-driven Automated Prompt Tuning (LAPT), a novel approach to OOD detection that reduces the need for manual prompt engineering. We develop distribution-aware prompts with in-distribution (ID) class names and negative labels mined automatically. Training samples linked to these class labels are collected autonomously via image synthesis and retrieval methods, allowing for prompt learning without manual effort. We utilize a simple cross-entropy loss for prompt optimization, with cross-modal and cross-distribution mixing strategies to reduce image noise and explore the intermediate space between distributions, respectively. The LAPT framework operates autonomously, requiring only ID class names as input and eliminating the need for manual intervention. With extensive experiments, LAPT consistently outperforms manually crafted prompts, setting a new standard for OOD detection. Moreover, LAPT not only enhances the distinction between ID and OOD samples, but also improves the ID classification accuracy and strengthens the generalization robustness to covariate shifts, resulting in outstanding performance in challenging full-spectrum OOD detection tasks. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/YBZh/LAPT}.</description>

      <title>SlideGCD: Slide-based Graph Collaborative Training with Knowledge Distillation for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing WSI analysis methods lie on the consensus that histopathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Particularly, as the evolution of cancers is a continuous process, the correlations and differences across various stages, anatomical locations and patients should be taken into account. However, recent research mainly focuses on the inner-contextual information in a single WSI, ignoring the correlations between slides. To verify whether introducing the slide inter-correlations can bring improvements to WSI representation learning, we propose a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that considers the existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods as the backbone and forge the WSI classification task as a node classification problem. More specifically, SlideGCD declares a node buffer that stores previous slide embeddings for subsequent extensive slide-based graph construction and conducts graph learning to explore the inter-correlations implied in the slide-based graph. Moreover, we frame the MIL classifier and graph learning into two parallel workflows and deploy the knowledge distillation to transfer the differentiable information to the graph neural network. The consistent performance boosting, brought by SlideGCD, of four previous state-of-the-art MIL methods is observed on two TCGA benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/HFUT-miaLab/SlideGCD.</description>

      <title>Full-Stage Pseudo Label Quality Enhancement for Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WSTAL) aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos using only video-level supervision. Latest WSTAL methods introduce pseudo label learning framework to bridge the gap between classification-based training and inferencing targets at localization, and achieve cutting-edge results. In these frameworks, a classification-based model is used to generate pseudo labels for a regression-based student model to learn from. However, the quality of pseudo labels in the framework, which is a key factor to the final result, is not carefully studied. In this paper, we propose a set of simple yet efficient pseudo label quality enhancement mechanisms to build our FuSTAL framework. FuSTAL enhances pseudo label quality at three stages: cross-video contrastive learning at proposal Generation-Stage, prior-based filtering at proposal Selection-Stage and EMA-based distillation at Training-Stage. These designs enhance pseudo label quality at different stages in the framework, and help produce more informative, less false and smoother action proposals. With the help of these comprehensive designs at all stages, FuSTAL achieves an average mAP of 50.8% on THUMOS'14, outperforming the previous best method by 1.2%, and becomes the first method to reach the milestone of 50%.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dark Secrets of Extremely Large Kernel ConvNets on Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness is a vital aspect to consider when deploying deep learning models into the wild. Numerous studies have been dedicated to the study of the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs), which have dominated as the mainstream backbone choice for vision tasks since the dawn of 2020s. Recently, some large kernel convnets make a comeback with impressive performance and efficiency. However, it still remains unclear whether large kernel networks are robust and the attribution of their robustness. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of large kernel convnets' robustness and their differences from typical small kernel counterparts and ViTs on six diverse robustness benchmark datasets. Then to analyze the underlying factors behind their strong robustness, we design experiments from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives to reveal large kernel convnets' intriguing properties that are completely different from typical convnets. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that pure CNNs can achieve exceptional robustness comparable or even superior to that of ViTs. Our analysis on occlusion invariance, kernel attention patterns and frequency characteristics provide novel insights into the source of robustness.</description>

      <title>Task-driven single-image super-resolution reconstruction of document scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution reconstruction is aimed at generating images of high spatial resolution from low-resolution observations. State-of-the-art super-resolution techniques underpinned with deep learning allow for obtaining results of outstanding visual quality, but it is seldom verified whether they constitute a valuable source for specific computer vision applications. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of employing super-resolution as a preprocessing step to improve optical character recognition from document scans. To achieve that, we propose to train deep networks for single-image super-resolution in a task-driven way to make them better adapted for the purpose of text detection. As problems limited to a specific task are heavily ill-posed, we introduce a multi-task loss function that embraces components related with text detection coupled with those guided by image similarity. The obtained results reported in this paper are encouraging and they constitute an important step towards real-world super-resolution of document images.</description>

      <title>Global Attention-Guided Dual-Domain Point Cloud Feature Learning for Classification and Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of point-based neural models on the point cloud analysis task. However, there remains a crucial issue on producing the efficient input embedding for raw point coordinates. Moreover, another issue lies in the limited efficiency of neighboring aggregations, which is a critical component in the network stem. In this paper, we propose a Global Attention-guided Dual-domain Feature Learning network (GAD) to address the above-mentioned issues. We first devise the Contextual Position-enhanced Transformer (CPT) module, which is armed with an improved global attention mechanism, to produce a global-aware input embedding that serves as the guidance to subsequent aggregations. Then, the Dual-domain K-nearest neighbor Feature Fusion (DKFF) is cascaded to conduct effective feature aggregation through novel dual-domain feature learning which appreciates both local geometric relations and long-distance semantic connections. Extensive experiments on multiple point cloud analysis tasks (e.g., classification, part segmentation, and scene semantic segmentation) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method and the efficacy of the devised modules.</description>

      <title>Introducing VaDA: Novel Image Segmentation Model for Maritime Object Segmentation Using New Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maritime shipping industry is undergoing rapid evolution driven by advancements in computer vision artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, research on AI-based object recognition models for maritime transportation is steadily growing, leveraging advancements in sensor technology and computing performance. However, object recognition in maritime environments faces challenges such as light reflection, interference, intense lighting, and various weather conditions. To address these challenges, high-performance deep learning algorithms tailored to maritime imagery and high-quality datasets specialized for maritime scenes are essential. Existing AI recognition models and datasets have limited suitability for composing autonomous navigation systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Vertical and Detail Attention (VaDA) model for maritime object segmentation and a new model evaluation method, the Integrated Figure of Calculation Performance (IFCP), to verify its suitability for the system in real-time. Additionally, we introduce a benchmark maritime dataset, OASIs (Ocean AI Segmentation Initiatives) to standardize model performance evaluation across diverse maritime environments.

      <title>TCAN: Animating Human Images with Temporally Consistent Pose Guidance using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pose-driven human-image animation diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in realistic human video synthesis. Despite the promising results achieved by previous approaches, challenges persist in achieving temporally consistent animation and ensuring robustness with off-the-shelf pose detectors. In this paper, we present TCAN, a pose-driven human image animation method that is robust to erroneous poses and consistent over time. In contrast to previous methods, we utilize the pre-trained ControlNet without fine-tuning to leverage its extensive pre-acquired knowledge from numerous pose-image-caption pairs. To keep the ControlNet frozen, we adapt LoRA to the UNet layers, enabling the network to align the latent space between the pose and appearance features. Additionally, by introducing an additional temporal layer to the ControlNet, we enhance robustness against outliers of the pose detector. Through the analysis of attention maps over the temporal axis, we also designed a novel temperature map leveraging pose information, allowing for a more static background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve promising results in video synthesis tasks encompassing various poses, like chibi.

      <title>HPC: Hierarchical Progressive Coding Framework for Volumetric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric video based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) holds vast potential for various 3D applications, but its substantial data volume poses significant challenges for compression and transmission. Current NeRF compression lacks the flexibility to adjust video quality and bitrate within a single model for various network and device capacities. To address these issues, we propose HPC, a novel hierarchical progressive volumetric video coding framework achieving variable bitrate using a single model. Specifically, HPC introduces a hierarchical representation with a multi-resolution residual radiance field to reduce temporal redundancy in long-duration sequences while simultaneously generating various levels of detail. Then, we propose an end-to-end progressive learning approach with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to jointly optimize both hierarchical representation and compression. Our HPC trained only once can realize multiple compression levels, while the current methods need to train multiple fixed-bitrate models for different rate-distortion (RD) tradeoffs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPC achieves flexible quality levels with variable bitrate by a single model and exhibits competitive RD performance, even outperforming fixed-bitrate models across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Textual Query-Driven Mask Transformer for Domain Generalized Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a method to tackle Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) by utilizing domain-invariant semantic knowledge from text embeddings of vision-language models. We employ the text embeddings as object queries within a transformer-based segmentation framework (textual object queries). These queries are regarded as a domain-invariant basis for pixel grouping in DGSS. To leverage the power of textual object queries, we introduce a novel framework named the textual query-driven mask transformer (tqdm). Our tqdm aims to (1) generate textual object queries that maximally encode domain-invariant semantics and (2) enhance the semantic clarity of dense visual features. Additionally, we suggest three regularization losses to improve the efficacy of tqdm by aligning between visual and textual features. By utilizing our method, the model can comprehend inherent semantic information for classes of interest, enabling it to generalize to extreme domains (e.g., sketch style). Our tqdm achieves 68.9 mIoU on GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art method by 2.5 mIoU.

      <title>Cs2K: Class-specific and Class-shared Knowledge Guidance for Incremental Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental semantic segmentation endeavors to segment newly encountered classes while maintaining knowledge of old classes. However, existing methods either 1) lack guidance from class-specific knowledge (i.e., old class prototypes), leading to a bias towards new classes, or 2) constrain class-shared knowledge (i.e., old model weights) excessively without discrimination, resulting in a preference for old classes. In this paper, to trade off model performance, we propose the Class-specific and Class-shared Knowledge (Cs2K) guidance for incremental semantic segmentation. Specifically, from the class-specific knowledge aspect, we design a prototype-guided pseudo labeling that exploits feature proximity from prototypes to correct pseudo labels, thereby overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, we develop a prototype-guided class adaptation that aligns class distribution across datasets via learning old augmented prototypes. Moreover, from the class-shared knowledge aspect, we propose a weight-guided selective consolidation to strengthen old memory while maintaining new memory by integrating old and new model weights based on weight importance relative to old classes. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cs2K significantly improves segmentation performance and is plug-and-play.</description>

      <title>DroneMOT: Drone-based Multi-Object Tracking Considering Detection Difficulties and Simultaneous Moving of Drones and Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) on static platforms, such as by surveillance cameras, has achieved significant progress, with various paradigms providing attractive performances. However, the effectiveness of traditional MOT methods is significantly reduced when it comes to dynamic platforms like drones. This decrease is attributed to the distinctive challenges in the MOT-on-drone scenario: (1) objects are generally small in the image plane, blurred, and frequently occluded, making them challenging to detect and recognize; (2) drones move and see objects from different angles, causing the unreliability of the predicted positions and feature embeddings of the objects. This paper proposes DroneMOT, which firstly proposes a Dual-domain Integrated Attention (DIA) module that considers the fast movements of drones to enhance the drone-based object detection and feature embedding for small-sized, blurred, and occluded objects. Then, an innovative Motion-Driven Association (MDA) scheme is introduced, considering the concurrent movements of both the drone and the objects. Within MDA, an Adaptive Feature Synchronization (AFS) technique is presented to update the object features seen from different angles. Additionally, a Dual Motion-based Prediction (DMP) method is employed to forecast the object positions. Finally, both the refined feature embeddings and the predicted positions are integrated to enhance the object association. Comprehensive evaluations on VisDrone2019-MOT and UAVDT datasets show that DroneMOT provides substantial performance improvements over the state-of-the-art in the domain of MOT on drones.</description>

      <title>PersonificationNet: Making customized subject act like a person</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently customized generation has significant potential, which uses as few as 3-5 user-provided images to train a model to synthesize new images of a specified subject. Though subsequent applications enhance the flexibility and diversity of customized generation, fine-grained control over the given subject acting like the person's pose is still lack of study. In this paper, we propose a PersonificationNet, which can control the specified subject such as a cartoon character or plush toy to act the same pose as a given referenced person's image. It contains a customized branch, a pose condition branch and a structure alignment module. Specifically, first, the customized branch mimics specified subject appearance. Second, the pose condition branch transfers the body structure information from the human to variant instances. Last, the structure alignment module bridges the structure gap between human and specified subject in the inference stage. Experimental results show our proposed PersonificationNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Domain-adaptive Video Deblurring via Test-time Blurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic scene video deblurring aims to remove undesirable blurry artifacts captured during the exposure process. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved impressive results, they suffer from significant performance drops due to the domain gap between training and testing videos, especially for those captured in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a domain adaptation scheme based on a blurring model to achieve test-time fine-tuning for deblurring models in unseen domains. Since blurred and sharp pairs are unavailable for fine-tuning during inference, our scheme can generate domain-adaptive training pairs to calibrate a deblurring model for the target domain. First, a Relative Sharpness Detection Module is proposed to identify relatively sharp regions from the blurry input images and regard them as pseudo-sharp images. Next, we utilize a blurring model to produce blurred images based on the pseudo-sharp images extracted during testing. To synthesize blurred images in compliance with the target data distribution, we propose a Domain-adaptive Blur Condition Generation Module to create domain-specific blur conditions for the blurring model. Finally, the generated pseudo-sharp and blurred pairs are used to fine-tune a deblurring model for better performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve state-of-the-art video deblurring methods, providing performance gains of up to 7.54dB on various real-world video deblurring datasets.

      <title>Open Vocabulary Multi-Label Video Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation with Conservation Property for ResNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transparent formulation of explanation methods is essential for elucidating the predictions of neural networks, which are typically black-box models. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a well-established method that transparently traces the flow of a model's prediction backward through its architecture by backpropagating relevance scores. However, the conventional LRP does not fully consider the existence of skip connections, and thus its application to the widely used ResNet architecture has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we extend LRP to ResNet models by introducing Relevance Splitting at points where the output from a skip connection converges with that from a residual block. Our formulation guarantees the conservation property throughout the process, thereby preserving the integrity of the generated explanations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on ImageNet and the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Our method achieves superior performance to that of baseline methods on standard evaluation metrics such as the Insertion-Deletion score while maintaining its conservation property. We will release our code for further research at https://5ei74r0.github.io/lrp-for-resnet.page/</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Semantic Segmentation: Trying Harder Pays Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are vulnerable to tiny adversarial input perturbations optimized to cause a very large output error. To measure this vulnerability, we need reliable methods that can find such adversarial perturbations. For image classification models, evaluation methodologies have emerged that have stood the test of time. However, we argue that in the area of semantic segmentation, a good approximation of the sensitivity to adversarial perturbations requires significantly more effort than what is currently considered satisfactory. To support this claim, we re-evaluate a number of well-known robust segmentation models in an extensive empirical study. We propose new attacks and combine them with the strongest attacks available in the literature. We also analyze the sensitivity of the models in fine detail. The results indicate that most of the state-of-the-art models have a dramatically larger sensitivity to adversarial perturbations than previously reported. We also demonstrate a size-bias: small objects are often more easily attacked, even if the large objects are robust, a phenomenon not revealed by current evaluation metrics. Our results also demonstrate that a diverse set of strong attacks is necessary, because different models are often vulnerable to different attacks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a diverse collection of neurobiological conditions marked by challenges in social communication and reciprocal interactions, as well as repetitive and stereotypical behaviors. Atypical behavior patterns in a long, untrimmed video can serve as biomarkers for children with ASD. In this paper, we propose a video-based weakly-supervised method that takes spatio-temporal features of long videos to learn typical and atypical behaviors for autism detection. On top of that, we propose a shallow TCN-MLP network, which is designed to further categorize the severity score. We evaluate our method on actual evaluation videos of children with autism collected and annotated (for severity score) by clinical professionals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of behavioral biomarkers that could help clinicians in autism spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>DART: An Automated End-to-End Object Detection Pipeline with Data Diversification, Open-Vocabulary Bounding Box Annotation, Pseudo-Label Review, and Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift and accurate detection of specified objects is crucial for many industrial applications, such as safety monitoring on construction sites. However, traditional approaches rely heavily on arduous manual annotation and data collection, which struggle to adapt to ever-changing environments and novel target objects. To address these limitations, this paper presents DART, an automated end-to-end pipeline designed to streamline the entire workflow of an object detection application from data collection to model deployment. DART eliminates the need for human labeling and extensive data collection while excelling in diverse scenarios. It employs a subject-driven image generation module (DreamBooth with SDXL) for data diversification, followed by an annotation stage where open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO) generates bounding box annotations for both generated and original images. These pseudo-labels are then reviewed by a large multimodal model (GPT-4o) to guarantee credibility before serving as ground truth to train real-time object detectors (YOLO). We apply DART to a self-collected dataset of construction machines named Liebherr Product, which contains over 15K high-quality images across 23 categories. The current implementation of DART significantly increases average precision (AP) from 0.064 to 0.832. Furthermore, we adopt a modular design for DART to ensure easy exchangeability and extensibility. This allows for a smooth transition to more advanced algorithms in the future, seamless integration of new object categories without manual labeling, and adaptability to customized environments without extra data collection. The code and dataset are released at https://github.com/chen-xin-94/DART.</description>

      <title>From Easy to Hard: Learning Curricular Shape-aware Features for Robust Panoptic Scene Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation (PSG) aims to generate a comprehensive graph-structure representation based on panoptic segmentation masks. Despite remarkable progress in PSG, almost all existing methods neglect the importance of shape-aware features, which inherently focus on the contours and boundaries of objects. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic Curricular shApe-aware FEature (CAFE) learning strategy for PSG. Specifically, we incorporate shape-aware features (i.e., mask features and boundary features) into PSG, moving beyond reliance solely on bbox features. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from human cognition, we propose to integrate shape-aware features in an easy-to-hard manner. To achieve this, we categorize the predicates into three groups based on cognition learning difficulty and correspondingly divide the training process into three stages. Each stage utilizes a specialized relation classifier to distinguish specific groups of predicates. As the learning difficulty of predicates increases, these classifiers are equipped with features of ascending complexity. We also incorporate knowledge distillation to retain knowledge acquired in earlier stages. Due to its model-agnostic nature, CAFE can be seamlessly incorporated into any PSG model. Extensive experiments and ablations on two PSG tasks under both robust and zero-shot PSG have attested to the superiority and robustness of our proposed CAFE, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Salt &amp; Pepper Heatmaps: Diffusion-informed Landmark Detection Strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anatomical Landmark Detection is the process of identifying key areas of an image for clinical measurements. Each landmark is a single ground truth point labelled by a clinician. A machine learning model predicts the locus of a landmark as a probability region represented by a heatmap. Diffusion models have increased in popularity for generative modelling due to their high quality sampling and mode coverage, leading to their adoption in medical image processing for semantic segmentation. Diffusion modelling can be further adapted to learn a distribution over landmarks. The stochastic nature of diffusion models captures fluctuations in the landmark prediction, which we leverage by blurring into meaningful probability regions. In this paper, we reformulate automatic Anatomical Landmark Detection as a precise generative modelling task, producing a few-hot pixel heatmap. Our method achieves state-of-the-art MRE and comparable SDR performance with existing work.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HUP-3D, a 3D multi-view multi-modal synthetic dataset for hand-ultrasound (US) probe pose estimation in the context of obstetric ultrasound. Egocentric markerless 3D joint pose estimation has potential applications in mixed reality based medical education. The ability to understand hand and probe movements programmatically opens the door to tailored guidance and mentoring applications. Our dataset consists of over 31k sets of RGB, depth and segmentation mask frames, including pose related ground truth data, with a strong emphasis on image diversity and complexity. Adopting a camera viewpoint-based sphere concept allows us to capture a variety of views and generate multiple hand grasp poses using a pre-trained network. Additionally, our approach includes a software-based image rendering concept, enhancing diversity with various hand and arm textures, lighting conditions, and background images. Furthermore, we validated our proposed dataset with state-of-the-art learning models and we obtained the lowest hand-object keypoint errors. The dataset and other details are provided with the supplementary material. The source code of our grasp generation and rendering pipeline will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Fair Ranking and New Model for Panoptic Scene Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In panoptic scene graph generation (PSGG), models retrieve interactions between objects in an image which are grounded by panoptic segmentation masks. Previous evaluations on panoptic scene graphs have been subject to an erroneous evaluation protocol where multiple masks for the same object can lead to multiple relation distributions per mask-mask pair. This can be exploited to increase the final score. We correct this flaw and provide a fair ranking over a wide range of existing PSGG models. The observed scores for existing methods increase by up to 7.4 mR@50 for all two-stage methods, while dropping by up to 19.3 mR@50 for all one-stage methods, highlighting the importance of a correct evaluation. Contrary to recent publications, we show that existing two-stage methods are competitive to one-stage methods. Building on this, we introduce the Decoupled SceneFormer (DSFormer), a novel two-stage model that outperforms all existing scene graph models by a large margin of +11 mR@50 and +10 mNgR@50 on the corrected evaluation, thus setting a new SOTA. As a core design principle, DSFormer encodes subject and object masks directly into feature space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring surgical data for research and development is significantly hindered by high annotation costs and practical and ethical constraints. Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis on adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain, leveraging the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with surgical action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate various language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions based on triplet-based textual inputs. Our analysis demonstrates strong alignment between long and triplet-based captions, supporting the use of triplet-based labels. We address the challenges in training text-to-image models on triplet-based captions without additional input signals by uncovering that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space and then, by designing an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract the imbalance and skewness in the surgical data, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We evaluate our model using diverse metrics, including human expert surveys and automated methods like FID and CLIP scores. We assess the model performance on key aspects: quality, alignment, reasoning, knowledge, and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in providing a realistic alternative to real data collection.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Human Intuition to Complete the Missing Information in Images for Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we attempt to model intuition and incorporate this formalism to improve the performance of the Convolutional Neural Networks. Despite decades of research, ambiguities persist on principles of intuition. Experimental psychology reveals many types of intuition, which depend on state of the human mind. We focus on visual intuition, useful for completing missing information during visual cognitive tasks. First, we set up a scenario to gradually decrease the amount of visual information in the images of a dataset to examine its impact on CNN accuracy. Then, we represent a model for visual intuition using Gestalt theory. The theory claims that humans derive a set of templates according to their subconscious experiences. When the brain decides that there is missing information in a scene, such as occlusion, it instantaneously completes the information by replacing the missing parts with the most similar ones. Based upon Gestalt theory, we model the visual intuition, in two layers. Details of these layers are provided throughout the paper. We use the MNIST data set to test the suggested intuition model for completing the missing information. Experiments show that the augmented CNN architecture provides higher performances compared to the classic models when using incomplete images.</description>

      <title>Semantic UV mapping to improve texture inpainting for indoor scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to improve texture inpainting after clutter removal in scanned indoor meshes. This is achieved with a new UV mapping pre-processing step which leverages semantic information of indoor scenes to more accurately match the UV islands with the 3D representation of distinct structural elements like walls and floors. Semantic UV Mapping enriches classic UV unwrapping algorithms by not only relying on geometric features but also visual features originating from the present texture. The segmentation improves the UV mapping and simultaneously simplifies the 3D geometric reconstruction of the scene after the removal of loose objects. Each segmented element can be reconstructed separately using the boundary conditions of the adjacent elements. Because this is performed as a pre-processing step, other specialized methods for geometric and texture reconstruction can be used in the future to improve the results even further.</description>

      <title>iNeMo: Incremental Neural Mesh Models for Robust Class-Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from human nature, it is still common practice today for vision tasks to train deep learning models only initially and on fixed datasets. A variety of approaches have recently addressed handling continual data streams. However, extending these methods to manage out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios has not effectively been investigated. On the other hand, it has recently been shown that non-continual neural mesh models exhibit strong performance in generalizing to such OOD scenarios. To leverage this decisive property in a continual learning setting, we propose incremental neural mesh models that can be extended with new meshes over time. In addition, we present a latent space initialization strategy that enables us to allocate feature space for future unseen classes in advance and a positional regularization term that forces the features of the different classes to consistently stay in respective latent space regions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on the Pascal3D and ObjectNet3D datasets and show that our approach outperforms the baselines for classification by $2-6\%$ in the in-domain and by $6-50\%$ in the OOD setting. Our work also presents the first incremental learning approach for pose estimation. Our code and model can be found at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/iNeMo.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing interest in computer vision applications for nutrition and dietary monitoring has led to the development of advanced 3D reconstruction techniques for food items. However, the scarcity of high-quality data and limited collaboration between industry and academia have constrained progress in this field. Building on recent advancements in 3D reconstruction, we host the MetaFood Workshop and its challenge for Physically Informed 3D Food Reconstruction. This challenge focuses on reconstructing volume-accurate 3D models of food items from 2D images, using a visible checkerboard as a size reference. Participants were tasked with reconstructing 3D models for 20 selected food items of varying difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The easy level provides 200 images, the medium level provides 30 images, and the hard level provides only 1 image for reconstruction. In total, 16 teams submitted results in the final testing phase. The solutions developed in this challenge achieved promising results in 3D food reconstruction, with significant potential for improving portion estimation for dietary assessment and nutritional monitoring.

      <title>WSESeg: Introducing a Dataset for the Segmentation of Winter Sports Equipment with a Baseline for Interactive Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new dataset containing instance segmentation masks for ten different categories of winter sports equipment, called WSESeg (Winter Sports Equipment Segmentation). Furthermore, we carry out interactive segmentation experiments on said dataset to explore possibilities for efficient further labeling. The SAM and HQ-SAM models are conceptualized as foundation models for performing user guided segmentation. In order to measure their claimed generalization capability we evaluate them on WSESeg. Since interactive segmentation offers the benefit of creating easily exploitable ground truth data during test-time, we are going to test various online adaptation methods for the purpose of exploring potentials for improvements without having to fine-tune the models explicitly. Our experiments show that our adaptation methods drastically reduce the Failure Rate (FR) and Number of Clicks (NoC) metrics, which generally leads faster to better interactive segmentation results.</description>

      <title>SS-SfP:Neural Inverse Rendering for Self Supervised Shape from (Mixed) Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel inverse rendering-based framework to estimate the 3D shape (per-pixel surface normals and depth) of objects and scenes from single-view polarization images, the problem popularly known as Shape from Polarization (SfP). The existing physics-based and learning-based methods for SfP perform under certain restrictions, i.e., (a) purely diffuse or purely specular reflections, which are seldom in the real surfaces, (b) availability of the ground truth surface normals for direct supervision that are hard to acquire and are limited by the scanner's resolution, and (c) known refractive index. To overcome these restrictions, we start by learning to separate the partially-polarized diffuse and specular reflection components, which we call reflectance cues, based on a modified polarization reflection model and then estimate shape under mixed polarization through an inverse-rendering based self-supervised deep learning framework called SS-SfP, guided by the polarization data and estimated reflectance cues. Furthermore, we also obtain the refractive index as a non-linear least squares solution. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we establish the efficacy of the proposed framework over simple single-object scenes from DeepSfP dataset and complex in-the-wild scenes from SPW dataset in an entirely self-supervised setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based approach to address SfP under mixed polarization in a completely self-supervised framework.</description>

      <title>PID: Physics-Informed Diffusion Model for Infrared Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared imaging technology has gained significant attention for its reliable sensing ability in low visibility conditions, prompting many studies to convert the abundant RGB images to infrared images. However, most existing image translation methods treat infrared images as a stylistic variation, neglecting the underlying physical laws, which limits their practical application. To address these issues, we propose a Physics-Informed Diffusion (PID) model for translating RGB images to infrared images that adhere to physical laws. Our method leverages the iterative optimization of the diffusion model and incorporates strong physical constraints based on prior knowledge of infrared laws during training. This approach enhances the similarity between translated infrared images and the real infrared domain without increasing extra training parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that PID significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/fangyuanmao/PID.</description>

      <title>ProDepth: Boosting Self-Supervised Multi-Frame Monocular Depth with Probabilistic Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised multi-frame monocular depth estimation relies on the geometric consistency between successive frames under the assumption of a static scene. However, the presence of moving objects in dynamic scenes introduces inevitable inconsistencies, causing misaligned multi-frame feature matching and misleading self-supervision during training. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ProDepth, which effectively addresses the mismatch problem caused by dynamic objects using a probabilistic approach. We initially deduce the uncertainty associated with static scene assumption by adopting an auxiliary decoder. This decoder analyzes inconsistencies embedded in the cost volume, inferring the probability of areas being dynamic. We then directly rectify the erroneous cost volume for dynamic areas through a Probabilistic Cost Volume Modulation (PCVM) module. Specifically, we derive probability distributions of depth candidates from both single-frame and multi-frame cues, modulating the cost volume by adaptively fusing those distributions based on the inferred uncertainty. Additionally, we present a self-supervision loss reweighting strategy that not only masks out incorrect supervision with high uncertainty but also mitigates the risks in remaining possible dynamic areas in accordance with the probability. Our proposed method excels over state-of-the-art approaches in all metrics on both Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, and demonstrates superior generalization ability on the Waymo Open dataset.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Point Cloud Compact Model with Partial-aware Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has exhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, two drawbacks hinder their practical application. Firstly, the positional embedding of masked patches in the decoder results in the leakage of their central coordinates, leading to limited 3D representations. Secondly, the excessive model size of existing MPM methods results in higher demands for devices. To address these, we propose to pre-train Point cloud Compact Model with Partial-aware \textbf{R}econstruction, named Point-CPR. Specifically, in the decoder, we couple the vanilla masked tokens with their positional embeddings as randomly masked queries and introduce a partial-aware prediction module before each decoder layer to predict them from the unmasked partial. It prevents the decoder from creating a shortcut between the central coordinates of masked patches and their reconstructed coordinates, enhancing the robustness of models. We also devise a compact encoder composed of local aggregation and MLPs, reducing the parameters and computational requirements compared to existing Transformer-based encoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong performance across various tasks, especially surpassing the leading MPM-based model PointGPT-B with only 2% of its parameters.</description>

      <title>Imaging Interiors: An Implicit Solution to Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISP) have gained wide applications in computational imaging. By solving EISP, the internal relative permittivity of the scatterer can be non-invasively determined based on the scattered electromagnetic fields. Despite previous efforts to address EISP, achieving better solutions to this problem has remained elusive, due to the challenges posed by inversion and discretization. This paper tackles those challenges in EISP via an implicit approach. By representing the scatterer's relative permittivity as a continuous implicit representation, our method is able to address the low-resolution problems arising from discretization. Further, optimizing this implicit representation within a forward framework allows us to conveniently circumvent the challenges posed by inverse estimation. Our approach outperforms existing methods on standard benchmark datasets. Project page: https://luo-ziyuan.github.io/Imaging-Interiors</description>

      <title>A Unified Anomaly Synthesis Strategy with Gradient Ascent for Industrial Anomaly Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly synthesis strategies can effectively enhance unsupervised anomaly detection. However, existing strategies have limitations in the coverage and controllability of anomaly synthesis, particularly for weak defects that are very similar to normal regions. In this paper, we propose Global and Local Anomaly co-Synthesis Strategy (GLASS), a novel unified framework designed to synthesize a broader coverage of anomalies under the manifold and hypersphere distribution constraints of Global Anomaly Synthesis (GAS) at the feature level and Local Anomaly Synthesis (LAS) at the image level. Our method synthesizes near-in-distribution anomalies in a controllable way using Gaussian noise guided by gradient ascent and truncated projection. GLASS achieves state-of-the-art results on the MVTec AD (detection AUROC of 99.9\%), VisA, and MPDD datasets and excels in weak defect detection. The effectiveness and efficiency have been further validated in industrial applications for woven fabric defect detection. The code and dataset are available at: \url{https://github.com/cqylunlun/GLASS}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) involves adapting a pre-trained source model to continually changing unsupervised target domains. In this paper, we systematically analyze the challenges of this task: online environment, unsupervised nature, and the risks of error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting under continual domain shifts. To address these challenges, we reshape the online data buffering and organizing mechanism for CTTA. We propose an {uncertainty-aware buffering approach} to identify {and aggregate} significant samples with high certainty from the unsupervised, single-pass data stream. {Based on this}, we propose a graph-based class relation preservation constraint to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a pseudo-target replay objective is used to mitigate error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in both segmentation and classification CTTA tasks.

      <title>ConRebSeg: A Segmentation Dataset for Reinforced Concrete Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction industry has been traditionally slow in adopting digital technologies. However, these are becoming increasingly necessary due to a plentitude of challenges, such as a shortage of skilled labor and decreasing productivity levels compared to other industries. Autonomous robotic systems can alleviate this problem, but the software development process for these systems is heavily driven by data, a resource usually challenging to find in the construction domain due to the lack of public availability. In our work, we therefore provide a dataset of 14,805 RGB images with segmentation labels for reinforced concrete construction and make it publicly available. We conduct a detailed analysis of our dataset and discuss how to deal with labeling inconsistencies. Furthermore, we establish baselines for the YOLOv8L-seg, DeepLabV3, and U-Net segmentation models and investigate the influence of data availability and label inconsistencies on the performance of these models. Our study showed that the models are precise in their predictions but would benefit from more data to increase the number of recalled instances. Label inconsistencies had a negligible effect on model performance, and we, therefore, advocate for a crowd-sourced dataset to boost the development of autonomous robotic systems in the construction industry.</description>

      <title>FANet: Feature Amplification Network for Semantic Segmentation in Cluttered Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches leave out the semantic cues that are crucial in semantic segmentation present in complex scenarios including cluttered backgrounds and translucent objects, etc. To handle these challenges, we propose a feature amplification network (FANet) as a backbone network that incorporates semantic information using a novel feature enhancement module at multi-stages. To achieve this, we propose an adaptive feature enhancement (AFE) block that benefits from both a spatial context module (SCM) and a feature refinement module (FRM) in a parallel fashion. SCM aims to exploit larger kernel leverages for the increased receptive field to handle scale variations in the scene. Whereas our novel FRM is responsible for generating semantic cues that can capture both low-frequency and high-frequency regions for better segmentation tasks. We perform experiments over challenging real-world ZeroWaste-f dataset which contains background-cluttered and translucent objects. Our experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural radiance fields, or NeRFs, have become the de facto approach for high-quality view synthesis from a collection of images captured from multiple viewpoints. However, many issues remain when capturing images in-the-wild under challenging conditions, such as low light, high dynamic range, or rapid motion leading to smeared reconstructions with noticeable artifacts. In this work, we introduce quanta radiance fields, a novel class of neural radiance fields that are trained at the granularity of individual photons using single-photon cameras (SPCs). We develop theory and practical computational techniques for building radiance fields and estimating dense camera poses from unconventional, stochastic, and high-speed binary frame sequences captured by SPCs. We demonstrate, both via simulations and a SPC hardware prototype, high-fidelity reconstructions under high-speed motion, in low light, and for extreme dynamic range settings.</description>

      <title>Open-Canopy: A Country-Scale Benchmark for Canopy Height Estimation at Very High Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating canopy height and canopy height change at meter resolution from satellite imagery has numerous applications, such as monitoring forest health, logging activities, wood resources, and carbon stocks. However, many existing forest datasets are based on commercial or closed data sources, restricting the reproducibility and evaluation of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce Open-Canopy, the first open-access and country-scale benchmark for very high resolution (1.5 m) canopy height estimation. Covering more than 87,000 km$^2$ across France, Open-Canopy combines SPOT satellite imagery with high resolution aerial LiDAR data. We also propose Open-Canopy-$\Delta$, the first benchmark for canopy height change detection between two images taken at different years, a particularly challenging task even for recent models. To establish a robust foundation for these benchmarks, we evaluate a comprehensive list of state-of-the-art computer vision models for canopy height estimation. The dataset and associated codes can be accessed at https://github.com/fajwel/Open-Canopy.</description>

      <title>Rethinking temporal self-similarity for repetitive action counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting repetitive actions in long untrimmed videos is a challenging task that has many applications such as rehabilitation. State-of-the-art methods predict action counts by first generating a temporal self-similarity matrix (TSM) from the sampled frames and then feeding the matrix to a predictor network. The self-similarity matrix, however, is not an optimal input to a network since it discards too much information from the frame-wise embeddings. We thus rethink how a TSM can be utilized for counting repetitive actions and propose a framework that learns embeddings and predicts action start probabilities at full temporal resolution. The number of repeated actions is then inferred from the action start probabilities. In contrast to current approaches that have the TSM as an intermediate representation, we propose a novel loss based on a generated reference TSM, which enforces that the self-similarity of the learned frame-wise embeddings is consistent with the self-similarity of repeated actions. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets, i.e., RepCount, UCFRep, and Countix.</description>

      <title>StyleSplat: 3D Object Style Transfer with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in radiance fields have opened new avenues for creating high-quality 3D assets and scenes. Style transfer can enhance these 3D assets with diverse artistic styles, transforming creative expression. However, existing techniques are often slow or unable to localize style transfer to specific objects. We introduce StyleSplat, a lightweight method for stylizing 3D objects in scenes represented by 3D Gaussians from reference style images. Our approach first learns a photorealistic representation of the scene using 3D Gaussian splatting while jointly segmenting individual 3D objects. We then use a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the selected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style image to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick, customizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects within a scene, each with a different style. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various 3D scenes and styles, showcasing enhanced control and customization in 3D creation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently large vision-language models have shown potential when interpreting complex images and generating natural language descriptions using advanced reasoning. Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately. Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasets alongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these large vision-language models.</description>

      <title>FairDomain: Achieving Fairness in Cross-Domain Medical Image Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing fairness in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in medical AI, is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes. Recent efforts to enhance fairness have introduced new methodologies and datasets in medical AI. However, the fairness issue under the setting of domain transfer is almost unexplored, while it is common that clinics rely on different imaging technologies (e.g., different retinal imaging modalities) for patient diagnosis. This paper presents FairDomain, a pioneering systemic study into algorithmic fairness under domain shifts, employing state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) algorithms for both medical segmentation and classification tasks to understand how biases are transferred between different domains. We also introduce a novel plug-and-play fair identity attention (FIA) module that adapts to various DA and DG algorithms to improve fairness by using self-attention to adjust feature importance based on demographic attributes. Additionally, we curate the first fairness-focused dataset with two paired imaging modalities for the same patient cohort on medical segmentation and classification tasks, to rigorously assess fairness in domain-shift scenarios. Excluding the confounding impact of demographic distribution variation between source and target domains will allow clearer quantification of the performance of domain transfer models. Our extensive evaluations reveal that the proposed FIA significantly enhances both model performance accounted for fairness across all domain shift settings (i.e., DA and DG) with respect to different demographics, which outperforms existing methods on both segmentation and classification.

      <title>FedMedICL: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Distribution Shifts in Federated Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For medical imaging AI models to be clinically impactful, they must generalize. However, this goal is hindered by (i) diverse types of distribution shifts, such as temporal, demographic, and label shifts, and (ii) limited diversity in datasets that are siloed within single medical institutions. While these limitations have spurred interest in federated learning, current evaluation benchmarks fail to evaluate different shifts simultaneously. However, in real healthcare settings, multiple types of shifts co-exist, yet their impact on medical imaging performance remains unstudied. In response, we introduce FedMedICL, a unified framework and benchmark to holistically evaluate federated medical imaging challenges, simultaneously capturing label, demographic, and temporal distribution shifts. We comprehensively evaluate several popular methods on six diverse medical imaging datasets (totaling 550 GPU hours). Furthermore, we use FedMedICL to simulate COVID-19 propagation across hospitals and evaluate whether methods can adapt to pandemic changes in disease prevalence. We find that a simple batch balancing technique surpasses advanced methods in average performance across FedMedICL experiments. This finding questions the applicability of results from previous, narrow benchmarks in real-world medical settings.</description>

      <title>BraTS-PEDs: Results of the Multi-Consortium International Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade glioma in children is less than 20%. The development of new treatments is dependent upon multi-institutional collaborative clinical trials requiring reproducible and accurate centralized response assessment. We present the results of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, the first Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge focused on pediatric brain tumors. This challenge utilized data acquired from multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. BraTS-PEDs 2023 aimed to evaluate volumetric segmentation algorithms for pediatric brain gliomas from magnetic resonance imaging using standardized quantitative performance evaluation metrics employed across the BraTS 2023 challenges. The top-performing AI approaches for pediatric tumor analysis included ensembles of nnU-Net and Swin UNETR, Auto3DSeg, or nnU-Net with a self-supervised framework. The BraTSPEDs 2023 challenge fostered collaboration between clinicians (neuro-oncologists, neuroradiologists) and AI/imaging scientists, promoting faster data sharing and the development of automated volumetric analysis techniques. These advancements could significantly benefit clinical trials and improve the care of children with brain tumors.</description>

      <title>SALT: Introducing a Framework for Hierarchical Segmentations in Medical Imaging using Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional segmentation networks approach anatomical structures as standalone elements, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchical connections among them. This study introduces Softmax for Arbitrary Label Trees (SALT), a novel approach designed to leverage the hierarchical relationships between labels, improving the efficiency and interpretability of the segmentations.
  This study introduces a novel segmentation technique for CT imaging, which leverages conditional probabilities to map the hierarchical structure of anatomical landmarks, such as the spine's division into lumbar, thoracic, and cervical regions and further into individual vertebrae. The model was developed using the SAROS dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), comprising 900 body region segmentations from 883 patients. The dataset was further enhanced by generating additional segmentations with the TotalSegmentator, for a total of 113 labels. The model was trained on 600 scans, while validation and testing were conducted on 150 CT scans. Performance was assessed using the Dice score across various datasets, including SAROS, CT-ORG, FLARE22, LCTSC, LUNA16, and WORD.
  Among the evaluated datasets, SALT achieved its best results on the LUNA16 and SAROS datasets, with Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.929 respectively. The model demonstrated reliable accuracy across other datasets, scoring 0.891 on CT-ORG and 0.849 on FLARE22. The LCTSC dataset showed a score of 0.908 and the WORD dataset also showed good performance with a score of 0.844.
  SALT used the hierarchical structures inherent in the human body to achieve whole-body segmentations with an average of 35 seconds for 100 slices. This rapid processing underscores its potential for integration into clinical workflows, facilitating the automatic and efficient computation of full-body segmentations with each CT scan, thus enhancing diagnostic processes and patient care.</description>

      <title>Constructing Concept-based Models to Mitigate Spurious Correlations with Minimal Human Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing model interpretability can address spurious correlations by revealing how models draw their predictions. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) can provide a principled way of disclosing and guiding model behaviors through human-understandable concepts, albeit at a high cost of human efforts in data annotation. In this paper, we leverage a synergy of multiple foundation models to construct CBMs with nearly no human effort. We discover undesirable biases in CBMs built on pre-trained models and propose a novel framework designed to exploit pre-trained models while being immune to these biases, thereby reducing vulnerability to spurious correlations. Specifically, our method offers a seamless pipeline that adopts foundation models for assessing potential spurious correlations in datasets, annotating concepts for images, and refining the annotations for improved robustness. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing model reliance on spurious correlations while preserving its interpretability.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Awareness Encoded Deep Learning Framework for Brain Imaging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterogeneity of neurological conditions, ranging from structural anomalies to functional impairments, presents a significant challenge in medical imaging analysis tasks. Moreover, the limited availability of well-annotated datasets constrains the development of robust analysis models. Against this backdrop, this study introduces a novel approach leveraging the inherent anatomical symmetrical features of the human brain to enhance the subsequent detection and segmentation analysis for brain diseases. A novel Symmetry-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) module is proposed to encode symmetrical features of left and right hemispheres, and a proxy task to detect symmetrical features as the Symmetry-Aware Head (SAH) is proposed, which guides the pretraining of the whole network on a vast 3D brain imaging dataset comprising both healthy and diseased brain images across various MRI and CT. Through meticulous experimentation on downstream tasks, including both classification and segmentation for brain diseases, our model demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methodologies, particularly highlighting the significance of symmetry-aware learning. Our findings advocate for the effectiveness of incorporating symmetry awareness into pretraining and set a new benchmark for medical imaging analysis, promising significant strides toward accurate and efficient diagnostic processes.

      <title>Tissue-Contrastive Semi-Masked Autoencoders for Segmentation Pretraining on Chest CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Masked Image Modeling (MIM) depends on a spatial patch-based masking-reconstruction strategy to perceive objects'features from unlabeled images, which may face two limitations when applied to chest CT: 1) inefficient feature learning due to complex anatomical details presented in CT images, and 2) suboptimal knowledge transfer owing to input disparity between upstream and downstream models. To address these issues, we propose a new MIM method named Tissue-Contrastive Semi-Masked Autoencoder (TCS-MAE) for modeling chest CT images. Our method has two novel designs: 1) a tissue-based masking-reconstruction strategy to capture more fine-grained anatomical features, and 2) a dual-AE architecture with contrastive learning between the masked and original image views to bridge the gap of the upstream and downstream models. To validate our method, we systematically investigate representative contrastive, generative, and hybrid self-supervised learning methods on top of tasks involving segmenting pneumonia, mediastinal tumors, and various organs. The results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our TCS-MAE more effectively learns tissue-aware representations, thereby significantly enhancing segmentation performance across all tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Emotion Recognition in Incomplete Data: A Novel Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition systems rely heavily on the full availability of modalities, suffering significant performance declines when modal data is incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present the Cross-Modal Alignment, Reconstruction, and Refinement (CM-ARR) framework, an innovative approach that sequentially engages in cross-modal alignment, reconstruction, and refinement phases to handle missing modalities and enhance emotion recognition. This framework utilizes unsupervised distribution-based contrastive learning to align heterogeneous modal distributions, reducing discrepancies and modeling semantic uncertainty effectively. The reconstruction phase applies normalizing flow models to transform these aligned distributions and recover missing modalities. The refinement phase employs supervised point-based contrastive learning to disrupt semantic correlations and accentuate emotional traits, thereby enriching the affective content of the reconstructed representations. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets confirm the superior performance of CM-ARR under conditions of both missing and complete modalities. Notably, averaged across six scenarios of missing modalities, CM-ARR achieves absolute improvements of 2.11% in WAR and 2.12% in UAR on the IEMOCAP dataset, and 1.71% and 1.96% in WAR and UAR, respectively, on the MSP-IMPROV dataset.</description>

      <title>CAMP: Continuous and Adaptive Learning Model in Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist numerous diagnostic tasks in pathology. Conventional computational pathology formulates and tackles them as independent and individual image classification problems, thereby resulting in computational inefficiency and high costs. To address the challenges, we propose a generic, unified, and universal framework, called a continuous and adaptive learning model in pathology (CAMP), for pathology image classification. CAMP is a generative, efficient, and adaptive classification model that can continuously adapt to any classification task by leveraging pathology-specific prior knowledge and learning taskspecific knowledge with minimal computational cost and without forgetting the knowledge from the existing tasks. We evaluated CAMP on 22 datasets, including 1,171,526 patches and 11,811 pathology slides, across 17 classification tasks. CAMP achieves state-of-theart classification performance on a wide range of datasets and tasks at both patch- and slide-levels and reduces up to 94% of computation time and 85% of storage memory in comparison to the conventional classification models. Our results demonstrate that CAMP can offer a fundamental transformation in pathology image classification, paving the way for the fully digitized and computerized pathology practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been increasingly incorporated into various computational pathology applications to improve its efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Although successful, most previous approaches for image classification have crucial drawbacks. There exist numerous tasks in pathology, but one needs to build a model per task, i.e., a task-specific model, thereby increasing the number of models, training resources, and cost. Moreover, transferring arbitrary task-specific model to another task is still a challenging problem. Herein, we propose a task-agnostic generative and general pathology image classifier, so called GPC, that aims at learning from diverse kinds of pathology images and conducting numerous classification tasks in a unified model. GPC, equipped with a convolutional neural network and a Transformer-based language model, maps pathology images into a high-dimensional feature space and generates pertinent class labels as texts via the image-to-text classification mechanism. We evaluate GPC on six datasets for four different pathology image classification tasks. Experimental results show that GPC holds considerable potential for developing an effective and efficient universal model for pathology image analysis.</description>

      <title>Refusing Safe Prompts for Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become the cornerstone of today's generative AI ecosystem, sparking intense competition among tech giants and startups. In particular, an MLLM generates a text response given a prompt consisting of an image and a question. While state-of-the-art MLLMs use safety filters and alignment techniques to refuse unsafe prompts, in this work, we introduce MLLM-Refusal, the first method that induces refusals for safe prompts. In particular, our MLLM-Refusal optimizes a nearly-imperceptible refusal perturbation and adds it to an image, causing target MLLMs to likely refuse a safe prompt containing the perturbed image and a safe question. Specifically, we formulate MLLM-Refusal as a constrained optimization problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Our method offers competitive advantages for MLLM model providers by potentially disrupting user experiences of competing MLLMs, since competing MLLM's users will receive unexpected refusals when they unwittingly use these perturbed images in their prompts. We evaluate MLLM-Refusal on four MLLMs across four datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in causing competing MLLMs to refuse safe prompts while not affecting non-competing MLLMs. Furthermore, we explore three potential countermeasures -- adding Gaussian noise, DiffPure, and adversarial training. Our results show that they are insufficient: though they can mitigate MLLM-Refusal's effectiveness, they also sacrifice the accuracy and/or efficiency of the competing MLLM. The code is available at https://github.com/Sadcardation/MLLM-Refusal.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Discrete Tokenization in Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of self-supervised learning (SSL), masked image modeling (MIM) has gained popularity alongside contrastive learning methods. MIM involves reconstructing masked regions of input images using their unmasked portions. A notable subset of MIM methodologies employs discrete tokens as the reconstruction target, but the theoretical underpinnings of this choice remain underexplored. In this paper, we explore the role of these discrete tokens, aiming to unravel their benefits and limitations. Building upon the connection between MIM and contrastive learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding on how discrete tokenization affects the model's generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel metric named TCAS, which is specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of discrete tokens within the MIM framework. Inspired by this metric, we contribute an innovative tokenizer design and propose a corresponding MIM method named ClusterMIM. It demonstrates superior performance on a variety of benchmark datasets and ViT backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/ClusterMIM.</description>

      <title>FD-SOS: Vision-Language Open-Set Detectors for Bone Fenestration and Dehiscence Detection from Intraoral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection of bone fenestration and dehiscence (FD) is crucial for effective treatment planning in dentistry. While cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the gold standard for evaluating FD, it comes with limitations such as radiation exposure, limited accessibility, and higher cost compared to intraoral images. In intraoral images, dentists face challenges in the differential diagnosis of FD. This paper presents a novel and clinically significant application of FD detection solely from intraoral images. To achieve this, we propose FD-SOS, a novel open-set object detector for FD detection from intraoral images. FD-SOS has two novel components: conditional contrastive denoising (CCDN) and teeth-specific matching assignment (TMA). These modules enable FD-SOS to effectively leverage external dental semantics. Experimental results showed that our method outperformed existing detection methods and surpassed dental professionals by 35% recall under the same level of precision.

      <title>Beyond Image Prior: Embedding Noise Prior into Conditional Denoising Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing learning-based denoising methods typically train models to generalize the image prior from large-scale datasets, suffering from the variability in noise distributions encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>URRL-IMVC: Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to cluster multi-view data that are only partially available. This poses two main challenges: effectively leveraging multi-view information and mitigating the impact of missing views. Prevailing solutions employ cross-view contrastive learning and missing view recovery techniques. However, they either neglect valuable complementary information by focusing only on consensus between views or provide unreliable recovered views due to the absence of supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (URRL-IMVC). URRL-IMVC directly learns a unified embedding that is robust to view missing conditions by integrating information from multiple views and neighboring samples. Firstly, to overcome the limitations of cross-view contrastive learning, URRL-IMVC incorporates an attention-based auto-encoder framework to fuse multi-view information and generate unified embeddings. Secondly, URRL-IMVC directly enhances the robustness of the unified embedding against view-missing conditions through KNN imputation and data augmentation techniques, eliminating the need for explicit missing view recovery. Finally, incremental improvements are introduced to further enhance the overall performance, such as the Clustering Module and the customization of the Encoder. We extensively evaluate the proposed URRL-IMVC framework on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our design.</description>

      <title>Machine Apophenia: The Kaleidoscopic Generation of Architectural Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of generative artificial intelligence in architectural design. We present a novel methodology that combines multiple neural networks to create an unsupervised and unmoderated stream of unique architectural images. Our approach is grounded in the conceptual framework called machine apophenia. We hypothesize that neural networks, trained on diverse human-generated data, internalize aesthetic preferences and tend to produce coherent designs even from random inputs. The methodology involves an iterative process of image generation, description, and refinement, resulting in captioned architectural postcards automatically shared on several social media platforms. Evaluation and ablation studies show the improvement both in technical and aesthetic metrics of resulting images on each step.</description>

      <title>Segmenting Medical Images with Limited Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While computer vision has proven valuable for medical image segmentation, its application faces challenges such as limited dataset sizes and the complexity of effectively leveraging unlabeled images. To address these challenges, we present a novel semi-supervised, consistency-based approach termed the data-efficient medical segmenter (DEMS). The DEMS features an encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates the developed online automatic augmenter (OAA) and residual robustness enhancement (RRE) blocks. The OAA augments input data with various image transformations, thereby diversifying the dataset to improve the generalization ability. The RRE enriches feature diversity and introduces perturbations to create varied inputs for different decoders, thereby providing enhanced variability. Moreover, we introduce a sensitive loss to further enhance consistency across different decoders and stabilize the training process. Extensive experimental results on both our own and three public datasets affirm the effectiveness of DEMS. Under extreme data shortage scenarios, our DEMS achieves 16.85\% and 10.37\% improvement in dice score compared with the U-Net and top-performed state-of-the-art method, respectively. Given its superior data efficiency, DEMS could present significant advancements in medical segmentation under small data regimes.

      <title>Region Attention Transformer for Medical Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated impressive results in medical image restoration, attributed to the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism in the spatial dimension. However, the majority of existing Transformers conduct attention within fixed and coarsely partitioned regions (\text{e.g.} the entire image or fixed patches), resulting in interference from irrelevant regions and fragmentation of continuous image content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Region Attention Transformer (RAT) that utilizes a region-based multi-head self-attention mechanism (R-MSA). The R-MSA dynamically partitions the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions using the robust Segment Anything Model (SAM) and then performs self-attention within these regions. This region partitioning is more flexible and interpretable, ensuring that only pixels from similar semantic regions complement each other, thereby eliminating interference from irrelevant regions. Moreover, we introduce a focal region loss to guide our model to adaptively focus on recovering high-difficulty regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAT in various medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, and pathological image super-resolution. Code is available at \href{https://github.com/Yaziwel/Region-Attention-Transformer-for-Medical-Image-Restoration.git}{https://github.com/RAT}.</description>

      <title>SPIQA: A Dataset for Multimodal Question Answering on Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. To address this limitation, we introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task involving multiple images that cover a wide variety of plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Let Me DeCode You: Decoder Conditioning with Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks for 3D segmentation tasks can be challenging, often requiring efficient and effective strategies to improve model performance. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, DeCode, that utilizes label-derived features for model conditioning to support the decoder in the reconstruction process dynamically, aiming to enhance the efficiency of the training process. DeCode focuses on improving 3D segmentation performance through the incorporation of conditioning embedding with learned numerical representation of 3D-label shape features. Specifically, we develop an approach, where conditioning is applied during the training phase to guide the network toward robust segmentation. When labels are not available during inference, our model infers the necessary conditioning embedding directly from the input data, thanks to a feed-forward network learned during the training phase. This approach is tested using synthetic data and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of teeth. For CBCT, three datasets are used: one publicly available and two in-house. Our results show that DeCode significantly outperforms traditional, unconditioned models in terms of generalization to unseen data, achieving higher accuracy at a reduced computational cost. This work represents the first of its kind to explore conditioning strategies in 3D data segmentation, offering a novel and more efficient method for leveraging annotated data. Our code, pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/SanoScience/DeCode .</description>

      <title>Adaptive Prediction Ensemble: Improving Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving often struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, sometimes performing worse than simple rule-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric GANs for Image-to-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.06931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing models for unsupervised image translation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn the mapping from the source domain to the target domain using a cycle-consistency loss. However, these methods always adopt a symmetric network architecture to learn both forward and backward cycles. Because of the task complexity and cycle input difference between the source and target domains, the inequality in bidirectional forward-backward cycle translations is significant and the amount of information between two domains is different. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of existing symmetric GANs in asymmetric translation tasks, and propose an AsymmetricGAN model with both translation and reconstruction generators of unequal sizes and different parameter-sharing strategy to adapt to the asymmetric need in both unsupervised and supervised image translation tasks. Moreover, the training stage of existing methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images, thus we explore different optimization losses for better training of AsymmetricGAN, making image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised generative tasks with 8 datasets show that AsymmetricGAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance compared with existing GANs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the asymmetric GAN structure on both unsupervised and supervised image translation tasks.</description>

      <title>CLIP-PAE: Projection-Augmentation Embedding to Extract Relevant Features for a Disentangled, Interpretable, and Controllable Text-Guided Face Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03919v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently introduced Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) bridges images and text by embedding them into a joint latent space. This opens the door to ample literature that aims to manipulate an input image by providing a textual explanation. However, due to the discrepancy between image and text embeddings in the joint space, using text embeddings as the optimization target often introduces undesired artifacts in the resulting images. Disentanglement, interpretability, and controllability are also hard to guarantee for manipulation. To alleviate these problems, we propose to define corpus subspaces spanned by relevant prompts to capture specific image characteristics. We introduce CLIP Projection-Augmentation Embedding (PAE) as an optimization target to improve the performance of text-guided image manipulation. Our method is a simple and general paradigm that can be easily computed and adapted, and smoothly incorporated into any CLIP-based image manipulation algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct several theoretical and empirical studies. As a case study, we utilize the method for text-guided semantic face editing. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that PAE facilitates a more disentangled, interpretable, and controllable image manipulation with state-of-the-art quality and accuracy.

      <title>Look Around and Learn: Self-Training Object Detection by Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an object detector is deployed in a novel setting it often experiences a drop in performance. This paper studies how an embodied agent can automatically fine-tune a pre-existing object detector while exploring and acquiring images in a new environment without relying on human intervention, i.e., a fully self-supervised approach. In our setting, an agent initially learns to explore the environment using a pre-trained off-the-shelf detector to locate objects and associate pseudo-labels. By assuming that pseudo-labels for the same object must be consistent across different views, we learn the exploration policy Look Around to mine hard samples, and we devise a novel mechanism called Disagreement Reconciliation for producing refined pseudo-labels from the consensus among observations. We implement a unified benchmark of the current state-of-the-art and compare our approach with pre-existing exploration policies and perception mechanisms. Our method is shown to outperform existing approaches, improving the object detector by 6.2% in a simulated scenario, a 3.59% advancement over other state-of-the-art methods, and by 9.97% in the real robotic test without relying on ground-truth. Code for the proposed approach and baselines are available at https://iit-pavis.github.io/Look_Around_And_Learn/.</description>

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging task in high-level process analysis, typically performed on video or kinematic data obtained from various sensors. This work presents two contributions related to action segmentation on kinematic data. Firstly, we introduce two versions of Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Recurrent Networks (MS-TCRNet), specifically designed for kinematic data. The architectures consist of a prediction generator with intra-stage regularization and Bidirectional LSTM or GRU-based refinement stages. Secondly, we propose two new data augmentation techniques, World Frame Rotation and Hand Inversion, which utilize the strong geometric structure of kinematic data to improve algorithm performance and robustness. We evaluate our models on three datasets of surgical suturing tasks: the Variable Tissue Simulation (VTS) Dataset and the newly introduced Bowel Repair Simulation (BRS) Dataset, both of which are open surgery simulation datasets collected by us, as well as the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS), a well-known benchmark in robotic surgery. Our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Improvements in Earth observation by satellites allow for imagery of ever higher temporal and spatial resolution. Leveraging this data for agricultural monitoring is key for addressing environmental and economic challenges. Current methods for crop segmentation using temporal data either rely on annotated data or are heavily engineered to compensate the lack of supervision. In this paper, we present and compare datasets and methods for both supervised and unsupervised pixel-wise segmentation of satellite image time series (SITS). We also introduce an approach to add invariance to spectral deformations and temporal shifts to classical prototype-based methods such as K-means and Nearest Centroid Classifier (NCC). We study different levels of supervision and show this simple and highly interpretable method achieves the best performance in the low data regime and significantly improves the state of the art for unsupervised classification of agricultural time series on four recent SITS datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation has drawn growing attention. To produce talking head videos with desired facial expressions, previous methods rely on extra reference videos to provide expression information, which may be difficult to find and hence limits their usage. In this work, we propose TalkCLIP, a framework that can generate talking heads where the expressions are specified by natural language, hence allowing for specifying expressions more conveniently. To model the mapping from text to expressions, we first construct a text-video paired talking head dataset where each video has diverse text descriptions that depict both coarse-grained emotions and fine-grained facial movements. Leveraging the proposed dataset, we introduce a CLIP-based style encoder that projects natural language-based descriptions to the representations of expressions. TalkCLIP can even infer expressions for descriptions unseen during training. TalkCLIP can also use text to modulate expression intensity and edit expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TalkCLIP achieves the advanced capability of generating photo-realistic talking heads with vivid facial expressions guided by text descriptions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the task of 3D visual grounding in large-scale dynamic scenes based on natural linguistic descriptions and online captured multi-modal visual data, including 2D images and 3D LiDAR point clouds. We present a novel method, dubbed WildRefer, for this task by fully utilizing the rich appearance information in images, the position and geometric clues in point cloud as well as the semantic knowledge of language descriptions. Besides, we propose two novel datasets, i.e., STRefer and LifeRefer, which focus on large-scale human-centric daily-life scenarios accompanied with abundant 3D object and natural language annotations. Our datasets are significant for the research of 3D visual grounding in the wild and has huge potential to boost the development of autonomous driving and service robots. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmarks.

      <description>arXiv:2305.16037v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GenerateCT, the first approach to generating 3D medical imaging conditioned on free-form medical text prompts, incorporates a text encoder and three key components: a novel causal vision transformer for encoding 3D CT volumes, a text-image transformer for aligning CT and text tokens, and a text-conditional super-resolution diffusion model. Without directly comparable methods in 3D medical imaging, we benchmarked GenerateCT against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superiority across all key metrics. Importantly, we evaluated GenerateCT's clinical applications in a multi-abnormality classification task. First, we established a baseline by training a multi-abnormality classifier on our real dataset. To further assess the model's generalization to external data and performance with unseen prompts in a zero-shot scenario, we employed an external set to train the classifier, setting an additional benchmark. We conducted two experiments in which we doubled the training datasets by synthesizing an equal number of volumes for each set using GenerateCT. The first experiment demonstrated an 11% improvement in the AP score when training the classifier jointly on real and generated volumes. The second experiment showed a 7% improvement when training on both real and generated volumes based on unseen prompts. Moreover, GenerateCT enables the scaling of synthetic training datasets to arbitrary sizes. As an example, we generated 100,000 3D CTs, fivefold the number in our real set, and trained the classifier exclusively on these synthetic CTs. Impressively, this classifier surpassed the performance of the one trained on all available real data by a margin of 8%. Last, domain experts evaluated the generated volumes, confirming a high degree of alignment with the text prompt.

      <title>D2S: Representing sparse descriptors and 3D coordinates for camera relocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art visual localization methods mostly rely on complex procedures to match local descriptors and 3D point clouds. However, these procedures can incur significant costs in terms of inference, storage, and updates over time. In this study, we propose a direct learning-based approach that utilizes a simple network named D2S to represent complex local descriptors and their scene coordinates. Our method is characterized by its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. It solely leverages a single RGB image for localization during the testing phase and only requires a lightweight model to encode a complex sparse scene. The proposed D2S employs a combination of a simple loss function and graph attention to selectively focus on robust descriptors while disregarding areas such as clouds, trees, and several dynamic objects. This selective attention enables D2S to effectively perform a binary-semantic classification for sparse descriptors. Additionally, we propose a simple outdoor dataset to evaluate the capabilities of visual localization methods in scene-specific generalization and self-updating from unlabeled observations. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in scene coordinate regression in indoor and outdoor environments. It demonstrates the ability to generalize beyond training data, including scenarios involving transitions from day to night and adapting to domain shifts, even in the absence of the labeled data sources.

      <title>MetaWeather: Few-Shot Weather-Degraded Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world weather conditions are intricate and often occur concurrently. However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions. To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.</description>

      <title>On-the-Fly Guidance Training for Medical Image Registration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15216v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel On-the-Fly Guidance (OFG) training framework for enhancing existing learning-based image registration models, addressing the limitations of weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods. Weakly-supervised methods struggle due to the scarcity of labeled data, and unsupervised methods directly depend on image similarity metrics for accuracy. Our method proposes a supervised fashion for training registration models, without the need for any labeled data. OFG generates pseudo-ground truth during training by refining deformation predictions with a differentiable optimizer, enabling direct supervised learning. OFG optimizes deformation predictions efficiently, improving the performance of registration models without sacrificing inference speed. Our method is tested across several benchmark datasets and leading models, it significantly enhanced performance, providing a plug-and-play solution for training learning-based registration models.

      <title>ABC Easy as 123: A Blind Counter for Exemplar-Free Multi-Class Class-agnostic Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class-agnostic counting methods enumerate objects of an arbitrary class, providing tremendous utility in many fields. Prior works have limited usefulness as they require either a set of examples of the type to be counted or that the query image contains only a single type of object. A significant factor in these shortcomings is the lack of a dataset to properly address counting in settings with more than one kind of object present. To address these issues, we propose the first Multi-class, Class-Agnostic Counting dataset (MCAC) and A Blind Counter (ABC123), a method that can count multiple types of objects simultaneously without using examples of type during training or inference. ABC123 introduces a new paradigm where instead of requiring exemplars to guide the enumeration, examples are found after the counting stage to help a user understand the generated outputs. We show that ABC123 outperforms contemporary methods on MCAC without needing human in-the-loop annotations. We also show that this performance transfers to FSC-147, the standard class-agnostic counting dataset. MCAC is available at MCAC.active.vision and ABC123 is available at ABC123.active.vision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled 3D generation from a single image. However, current methods often produce suboptimal results for novel views, with blurred textures and deviations from the reference image, limiting their practical applications. In this paper, we introduce HiFi-123, a method designed for high-fidelity and multi-view consistent 3D generation. Our contributions are twofold: First, we propose a Reference-Guided Novel View Enhancement (RGNV) technique that significantly improves the fidelity of diffusion-based zero-shot novel view synthesis methods. Second, capitalizing on the RGNV, we present a novel Reference-Guided State Distillation (RGSD) loss. When incorporated into the optimization-based image-to-3D pipeline, our method significantly improves 3D generation quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over existing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Video results are available on the project page.</description>

      <title>Detecting Visual Cues in the Intensive Care Unit and Association with Patient Clinical Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive Care Units (ICU) provide close supervision and continuous care to patients with life-threatening conditions. However, continuous patient assessment in the ICU is still limited due to time constraints and the workload on healthcare providers. Existing patient assessments in the ICU such as pain or mobility assessment are mostly sporadic and administered manually, thus introducing the potential for human errors. Developing Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can augment human assessments in the ICU can be beneficial for providing more objective and granular monitoring capabilities. For example, capturing the variations in a patient's facial cues related to pain or agitation can help in adjusting pain-related medications or detecting agitation-inducing conditions such as delirium. Additionally, subtle changes in visual cues during or prior to adverse clinical events could potentially aid in continuous patient monitoring when combined with high-resolution physiological signals and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. In this paper, we examined the association between visual cues and patient condition including acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain. We leveraged our AU-ICU dataset with 107,064 frames collected in the ICU annotated with facial action units (AUs) labels by trained annotators. We developed a new "masked loss computation" technique that addresses the data imbalance problem by maximizing data resource utilization. We trained the model using our AU-ICU dataset in conjunction with three external datasets to detect 18 AUs. The SWIN Transformer model achieved 0.57 mean F1-score and 0.89 mean accuracy on the test set. Additionally, we performed AU inference on 634,054 frames to evaluate the association between facial AUs and clinically important patient conditions such as acuity status, acute brain dysfunction, and pain.</description>

      <title>FrePolad: Frequency-Rectified Point Latent Diffusion for Point Cloud Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose FrePolad: frequency-rectified point latent diffusion, a point cloud generation pipeline integrating a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for the latent distribution. FrePolad simultaneously achieves high quality, diversity, and flexibility in point cloud cardinality for generation tasks while maintaining high computational efficiency. The improvement in generation quality and diversity is achieved through (1) a novel frequency rectification via spherical harmonics designed to retain high-frequency content while learning the point cloud distribution; and (2) a latent DDPM to learn the regularized yet complex latent distribution. In addition, FrePolad supports variable point cloud cardinality by formulating the sampling of points as conditional distributions over a latent shape distribution. Finally, the low-dimensional latent space encoded by the VAE contributes to FrePolad's fast and scalable sampling. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate FrePolad's state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality, diversity, and computational efficiency.

      <title>InstaStyle: Inversion Noise of a Stylized Image is Secretly a Style Adviser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stylized text-to-image generation focuses on creating images from textual descriptions while adhering to a style specified by a few reference images. However, subtle style variations within different reference images can hinder the model from accurately learning the target style. In this paper, we propose InstaStyle, a novel approach that excels in generating high-fidelity stylized images with only a single reference image. Our approach is based on the finding that the inversion noise from a stylized reference image inherently carries the style signal, as evidenced by their non-zero signal-to-noise ratio. We employ DDIM inversion to extract this noise from the reference image and leverage a diffusion model to generate new stylized images from the "style" noise. Additionally, the inherent ambiguity and bias of textual prompts impede the precise conveying of style. To address this, we introduce a learnable style token via prompt refinement, which enhances the accuracy of the style description for the reference image. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that InstaStyle achieves superior performance compared to current benchmarks. Furthermore, our approach also showcases its capability in the creative task of style combination with mixed inversion noise.</description>

      <title>Alternate Diverse Teaching for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation studies have shown promise in training models with limited labeled data. However, current dominant teacher-student based approaches can suffer from the confirmation bias. To address this challenge, we propose AD-MT, an alternate diverse teaching approach in a teacher-student framework. It involves a single student model and two non-trainable teacher models that are momentum-updated periodically and randomly in an alternate fashion. To mitigate the confirmation bias from the diverse supervision, the core of AD-MT lies in two proposed modules: the Random Periodic Alternate (RPA) Updating Module and the Conflict-Combating Module (CCM). The RPA schedules the alternating diverse updating process with complementary data batches, distinct data augmentation, and random switching periods to encourage diverse reasoning from different teaching perspectives. The CCM employs an entropy-based ensembling strategy to encourage the model to learn from both the consistent and conflicting predictions between the teachers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our AD-MT on the 2D and 3D medical segmentation benchmarks across various semi-supervised settings.</description>

      <title>DiG-IN: Diffusion Guidance for Investigating Networks -- Uncovering Classifier Differences Neuron Visualisations and Visual Counterfactual Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning has led to huge progress in complex image classification tasks like ImageNet, unexpected failure modes, e.g. via spurious features, call into question how reliably these classifiers work in the wild. Furthermore, for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic, and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons and spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers. Moreover, our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile.</description>

      <title>Motion-Guided Latent Diffusion for Temporally Consistent Real-world Video Super-resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world low-resolution (LR) videos have diverse and complex degradations, imposing great challenges on video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms to reproduce their high-resolution (HR) counterparts with high quality. Recently, the diffusion models have shown compelling performance in generating realistic details for image restoration tasks. However, the diffusion process has randomness, making it hard to control the contents of restored images. This issue becomes more serious when applying diffusion models to VSR tasks because temporal consistency is crucial to the perceptual quality of videos. In this paper, we propose an effective real-world VSR algorithm by leveraging the strength of pre-trained latent diffusion models. To ensure the content consistency among adjacent frames, we exploit the temporal dynamics in LR videos to guide the diffusion process by optimizing the latent sampling path with a motion-guided loss, ensuring that the generated HR video maintains a coherent and continuous visual flow. To further mitigate the discontinuity of generated details, we insert temporal module to the decoder and fine-tune it with an innovative sequence-oriented loss. The proposed motion-guided latent diffusion (MGLD) based VSR algorithm achieves significantly better perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed model design and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Revisit Human-Scene Interaction via Space Occupancy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-scene Interaction (HSI) generation is a challenging task and crucial for various downstream tasks. However, one of the major obstacles is its limited data scale. High-quality data with simultaneously captured human and 3D environments is hard to acquire, resulting in limited data diversity and complexity. In this work, we argue that interaction with a scene is essentially interacting with the space occupancy of the scene from an abstract physical perspective, leading us to a unified novel view of Human-Occupancy Interaction. By treating pure motion sequences as records of humans interacting with invisible scene occupancy, we can aggregate motion-only data into a large-scale paired human-occupancy interaction database: Motion Occupancy Base (MOB). Thus, the need for costly paired motion-scene datasets with high-quality scene scans can be substantially alleviated. With this new unified view of Human-Occupancy interaction, a single motion controller is proposed to reach the target state given the surrounding occupancy. Once trained on MOB with complex occupancy layout, which is stringent to human movements, the controller could handle cramped scenes and generalize well to general scenes with limited complexity like regular living rooms. With no GT 3D scenes for training, our method can generate realistic and stable HSI motions in diverse scenarios, including both static and dynamic scenes.

      <title>Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

      <title>Learning Contrastive Feature Representations for Facial Action Unit Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial action unit (AU) detection has long encountered the challenge of detecting subtle feature differences when AUs activate. Existing methods often rely on encoding pixel-level information of AUs, which not only encodes additional redundant information but also leads to increased model complexity and limited generalizability. Additionally, the accuracy of AU detection is negatively impacted by the class imbalance issue of each AU type, and the presence of noisy and false AU labels. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework aimed for AU detection that incorporates both self-supervised and supervised signals, thereby enhancing the learning of discriminative features for accurate AU detection. To tackle the class imbalance issue, we employ a negative sample re-weighting strategy that adjusts the step size of updating parameters for minority and majority class samples. Moreover, to address the challenges posed by noisy and false AU labels, we employ a sampling technique that encompasses three distinct types of positive sample pairs. This enables us to inject self-supervised signals into the supervised signal, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of noisy labels. Our experimental assessments, conducted on four widely-utilized benchmark datasets (BP4D, DISFA, GFT and Aff-Wild2), underscore the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods of AU detection.

      <title>Comparing supervised learning dynamics: Deep neural networks match human data efficiency but show a generalisation lag</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has seen many behavioral comparisons between humans and deep neural networks (DNNs) in the domain of image classification. Often, comparison studies focus on the end-result of the learning process by measuring and comparing the similarities in the representations of object categories once they have been formed. However, the process of how these representations emerge -- that is, the behavioral changes and intermediate stages observed during the acquisition -- is less often directly and empirically compared. Here we report a detailed investigation of the learning dynamics in human observers and various classic and state-of-the-art DNNs. We develop a constrained supervised learning environment to align learning-relevant conditions such as starting point, input modality, available input data and the feedback provided. Across the whole learning process we evaluate and compare how well learned representations can be generalized to previously unseen test data. Comparisons across the entire learning process indicate that DNNs demonstrate a level of data efficiency comparable to human learners, challenging some prevailing assumptions in the field. However, our results also reveal representational differences: while DNNs' learning is characterized by a pronounced generalisation lag, humans appear to immediately acquire generalizable representations without a preliminary phase of learning training set-specific information that is only later transferred to novel data.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents ShapeLLM, the first 3D Multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) designed for embodied interaction, exploring a universal 3D object understanding with 3D point clouds and languages. ShapeLLM is built upon an improved 3D encoder by extending ReCon to ReCon++ that benefits from multi-view image distillation for enhanced geometry understanding. By utilizing ReCon++ as the 3D point cloud input encoder for LLMs, ShapeLLM is trained on constructed instruction-following data and tested on our newly human-curated benchmark, 3D MM-Vet. ReCon++ and ShapeLLM achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D geometry understanding and language-unified 3D interaction tasks, such as embodied visual grounding.

      <title>Depth Information Assisted Collaborative Mutual Promotion Network for Single Image Dehazing</title>

Abstract: Recovering a clear image from a single hazy image is an open inverse problem. Although significant research progress has been made, most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream dehazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism, there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this, we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and dehazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks, an alternative implementation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand, the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand, by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image, the dehazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation, we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the dehazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than that of the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning traditionally relies on increasingly larger datasets. Yet, such datasets pose major storage challenges and usually contain non-influential samples, which could be ignored during training without negatively impacting the training quality. In response, the idea of distilling a dataset into a condensed set of synthetic samples, i.e., a distilled dataset, emerged. One key aspect is the selected architecture, usually ConvNet, for linking the original and synthetic datasets. However, the final accuracy is lower if the employed model architecture differs from that used during distillation. Another challenge is the generation of high-resolution images (128x128 and higher). To address both challenges, this paper proposes Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M) that combine diffusion in latent space with dataset distillation. Our novel diffusion process is tailored for this task and significantly improves the gradient flow for distillation. By adjusting the number of diffusion steps, LD3M also offers a convenient way of controlling the trade-off between distillation speed and dataset quality. Overall, LD3M consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 4.8 p.p. and 4.2 p.p. for 1 and 10 images per class, respectively, and on several ImageNet subsets and high resolutions (128x128 and 256x256).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Computer Vision in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for Examining Visitation and Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the importance of closely monitoring patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), many aspects are still assessed in a limited manner due to the time constraints imposed on healthcare providers. For example, although excessive visitations during rest hours can potentially exacerbate the risk of circadian rhythm disruption and delirium, it is not captured in the ICU. Likewise, while mobility can be an important indicator of recovery or deterioration in ICU patients, it is only captured sporadically or not captured at all. In the past few years, the computer vision field has found application in many domains by reducing the human burden. Using computer vision systems in the ICU can also potentially enable non-existing assessments or enhance the frequency and accuracy of existing assessments while reducing the staff workload. In this study, we leverage a state-of-the-art noninvasive computer vision system based on depth imaging to characterize ICU visitations and patients' mobility. We then examine the relationship between visitation and several patient outcomes, such as pain, acuity, and delirium. We found an association between deteriorating patient acuity and the incidence of delirium with increased visitations. In contrast, self-reported pain, reported using the Defense and Veteran Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), was correlated with decreased visitations. Our findings highlight the feasibility and potential of using noninvasive autonomous systems to monitor ICU patients.</description>

      <title>Introducing Routing Functions to Vision-Language Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Low-Rank Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA or Adapter, project a model's hidden states to a lower dimension, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to new data through this low-rank bottleneck. However, PEFT tasks involving multiple modalities, like vision-language (VL) tasks, require not only adaptation to new data but also learning the relationship between different modalities. Targeting at VL PEFT tasks, we propose a family of operations, called routing functions, to enhance VL alignment in the low-rank bottlenecks. These feature routing functions adopt linear operations and do not introduce new trainable parameters. In-depth analyses are conducted to study their behavior. In various VL PEFT settings, the routing functions significantly improve performance of the original PEFT methods, achieving over 20\% improvement on VQAv2 ($\text{RoBERTa}_{\text{large}}$+ViT-L/16) and 30\% on COCO Captioning (GPT2-medium+ViT-L/16). Also when fine-tuning a pre-trained multimodal model such as CLIP-BART, we observe smaller but consistent improvements across a range of VL PEFT tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/tingyu215/Routing_VLPEFT.</description>

      <title>Glyph-ByT5: A Customized Text Encoder for Accurate Visual Text Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual text rendering poses a fundamental challenge for contemporary text-to-image generation models, with the core problem lying in text encoder deficiencies. To achieve accurate text rendering, we identify two crucial requirements for text encoders: character awareness and alignment with glyphs. Our solution involves crafting a series of customized text encoder, Glyph-ByT5, by fine-tuning the character-aware ByT5 encoder using a meticulously curated paired glyph-text dataset. We present an effective method for integrating Glyph-ByT5 with SDXL, resulting in the creation of the Glyph-SDXL model for design image generation. This significantly enhances text rendering accuracy, improving it from less than $20\%$ to nearly $90\%$ on our design image benchmark. Noteworthy is Glyph-SDXL's newfound ability for text paragraph rendering, achieving high spelling accuracy for tens to hundreds of characters with automated multi-line layouts. Finally, through fine-tuning Glyph-SDXL with a small set of high-quality, photorealistic images featuring visual text, we showcase a substantial improvement in scene text rendering capabilities in open-domain real images. These compelling outcomes aim to encourage further exploration in designing customized text encoders for diverse and challenging tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neural volumetric pose feature, termed PoseMap, designed to enhance camera localization by encapsulating the information between images and the associated camera poses. Our framework leverages an Absolute Pose Regression (APR) architecture, together with an augmented NeRF module. This integration not only facilitates the generation of novel views to enrich the training dataset but also enables the learning of effective pose features. Additionally, we extend our architecture for self-supervised online alignment, allowing our method to be used and fine-tuned for unlabelled images within a unified framework. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 14.28% and 20.51% performance gain on average in indoor and outdoor benchmark scenes, outperforming existing APR methods with state-of-the-art accuracy.</description>

      <title>BaCon: Boosting Imbalanced Semi-supervised Learning via Balanced Feature-Level Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) reduces the need for extensive annotations in deep learning, but the more realistic challenge of imbalanced data distribution in SSL remains largely unexplored. In Class Imbalanced Semi-supervised Learning (CISSL), the bias introduced by unreliable pseudo-labels can be exacerbated by imbalanced data distributions. Most existing methods address this issue at instance-level through reweighting or resampling, but the performance is heavily limited by their reliance on biased backbone representation. Some other methods do perform feature-level adjustments like feature blending but might introduce unfavorable noise. In this paper, we discuss the bonus of a more balanced feature distribution for the CISSL problem, and further propose a Balanced Feature-Level Contrastive Learning method (BaCon). Our method directly regularizes the distribution of instances' representations in a well-designed contrastive manner. Specifically, class-wise feature centers are computed as the positive anchors, while negative anchors are selected by a straightforward yet effective mechanism. A distribution-related temperature adjustment is leveraged to control the class-wise contrastive degrees dynamically. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, STL10-LT, and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. For example, BaCon surpasses instance-level method FixMatch-based ABC on CIFAR10-LT with a 1.21% accuracy improvement, and outperforms state-of-the-art feature-level method CoSSL on CIFAR100-LT with a 0.63% accuracy improvement. When encountering more extreme imbalance degree, BaCon also shows better robustness than other methods.</description>

      <title>Find n' Propagate: Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection in Urban Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we tackle the limitations of current LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems, which are hindered by a restricted class vocabulary and the high costs associated with annotating new object classes. Our exploration of open-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel instances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor data. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines, categorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their input data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal \textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator, which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes. The source code is made available at https://github.com/djamahl99/findnpropagate.</description>

      <title>OTSeg: Multi-prompt Sinkhorn Attention for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent success of CLIP has demonstrated promising results in zero-shot semantic segmentation by transferring muiltimodal knowledge to pixel-level classification. However, leveraging pre-trained CLIP knowledge to closely align text embeddings with pixel embeddings still has limitations in existing approaches. To address this issue, we propose OTSeg, a novel multimodal attention mechanism aimed at enhancing the potential of multiple text prompts for matching associated pixel embeddings. We first propose Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn (MPS) based on the Optimal Transport (OT) algorithm, which leads multiple text prompts to selectively focus on various semantic features within image pixels. Moreover, inspired by the success of Sinkformers in unimodal settings, we introduce the extension of MPS, called Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn Attention (MPSA) , which effectively replaces cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer framework in multimodal settings. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that OTSeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant gains on Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation (ZS3) tasks across three benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>HAC: Hash-grid Assisted Context for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising framework for novel view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the point cloud of Gaussians (or anchors in our paper) presents challenges for compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context (HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully designed context model. To facilitate entropy coding, we utilize Gaussian distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while simultaneously improving fidelity, and achieving over $11\times$ size reduction over SOTA 3DGS compression approach Scaffold-GS.

      <description>arXiv:2403.18241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D shape generation aims to produce innovative 3D content adhering to specific conditions and constraints. Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.

      <title>Latent Watermark: Inject and Detect Watermarks in Latent Diffusion Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking is a tool for actively identifying and attributing the images generated by latent diffusion models. Existing methods face the dilemma of image quality and watermark robustness. Watermarks with superior image quality usually have inferior robustness against attacks such as blurring and JPEG compression, while watermarks with superior robustness usually significantly damage image quality. This dilemma stems from the traditional paradigm where watermarks are injected and detected in pixel space, relying on pixel perturbation for watermark detection and resilience against attacks. In this paper, we highlight that an effective solution to the problem is to both inject and detect watermarks in the latent diffusion space, and propose Latent Watermark with a progressive training strategy. It weakens the direct connection between quality and robustness and thus alleviates their contradiction. We conduct evaluations on two datasets and against 10 watermark attacks. 6 metrics measure the image quality and watermark robustness. Results show that compared to the recently proposed methods such as StegaStamp, StableSignature, RoSteALS, and TreeRing, LW not only surpasses them in terms of robustness but also offers superior image quality. Our code will be available at https://github.com/RichardSunnyMeng/LatentWatermark.</description>

      <title>LAKE-RED: Camouflaged Images Generation by Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00292v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Camouflaged vision perception is an important vision task with numerous practical applications. Due to the expensive collection and labeling costs, this community struggles with a major bottleneck that the species category of its datasets is limited to a small number of object species. However, the existing camouflaged generation methods require specifying the background manually, thus failing to extend the camouflaged sample diversity in a low-cost manner. In this paper, we propose a Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion (LAKE-RED) for camouflaged image generation. To our knowledge, our contributions mainly include: (1) For the first time, we propose a camouflaged generation paradigm that does not need to receive any background inputs. (2) Our LAKE-RED is the first knowledge retrieval-augmented method with interpretability for camouflaged generation, in which we propose an idea that knowledge retrieval and reasoning enhancement are separated explicitly, to alleviate the task-specific challenges. Moreover, our method is not restricted to specific foreground targets or backgrounds, offering a potential for extending camouflaged vision perception to more diverse domains. (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing approaches, generating more realistic camouflage images.</description>

      <title>SceneGraphLoc: Cross-Modal Coarse Visual Localization on 3D Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel problem, i.e., the localization of an input image within a multi-modal reference map represented by a database of 3D scene graphs. These graphs comprise multiple modalities, including object-level point clouds, images, attributes, and relationships between objects, offering a lightweight and efficient alternative to conventional methods that rely on extensive image databases. Given the available modalities, the proposed method SceneGraphLoc learns a fixed-sized embedding for each node (i.e., representing an object instance) in the scene graph, enabling effective matching with the objects visible in the input query image. This strategy significantly outperforms other cross-modal methods, even without incorporating images into the map embeddings. When images are leveraged, SceneGraphLoc achieves performance close to that of state-of-the-art techniques depending on large image databases, while requiring three orders-of-magnitude less storage and operating orders-of-magnitude faster. The code will be made public.</description>

      <title>Facial Affective Behavior Analysis with Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Facial affective behavior analysis (FABA) is crucial for understanding human mental states from images. However, traditional approaches primarily deploy models to discriminate among discrete emotion categories, and lack the fine granularity and reasoning capability for complex facial behaviors. The advent of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been proven successful in general visual understanding tasks. However, directly harnessing MLLMs for FABA is challenging due to the scarcity of datasets and benchmarks, neglecting facial prior knowledge, and low training efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce (i) an instruction-following dataset for two FABA tasks, e.g., emotion and action unit recognition, (ii) a benchmark FABA-Bench with a new metric considering both recognition and generation ability, and (iii) a new MLLM "EmoLA" as a strong baseline to the community. Our initiative on the dataset and benchmarks reveal the nature and rationale of facial affective behaviors, i.e., fine-grained facial movement, interpretability, and reasoning. Moreover, to build an effective and efficient FABA MLLM, we introduce a facial prior expert module with face structure knowledge and a low-rank adaptation module into pre-trained MLLM. We conduct extensive experiments on FABA-Bench and four commonly-used FABA datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed facial prior expert can boost the performance and EmoLA achieves the best results on our FABA-Bench. On commonly-used FABA datasets, EmoLA is competitive rivaling task-specific state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>CLIPping the Limits: Finding the Sweet Spot for Relevant Images in Automated Driving Systems Perception Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perception systems, especially cameras, are the eyes of automated driving systems. Ensuring that they function reliably and robustly is therefore an important building block in the automation of vehicles. There are various approaches to test the perception of automated driving systems. Ultimately, however, it always comes down to the investigation of the behavior of perception systems under specific input data. Camera images are a crucial part of the input data. Image data sets are therefore collected for the testing of automated driving systems, but it is non-trivial to find specific images in these data sets. Thanks to recent developments in neural networks, there are now methods for sorting the images in a data set according to their similarity to a prompt in natural language. In order to further automate the provision of search results, we make a contribution by automating the threshold definition in these sorted results and returning only the images relevant to the prompt as a result. Our focus is on preventing false positives and false negatives equally. It is also important that our method is robust and in the case that our assumptions are not fulfilled, we provide a fallback solution.</description>

      <title>OmniSat: Self-Supervised Modality Fusion for Earth Observation</title>

Abstract: The field of Earth Observations (EO) offers a wealth of data from diverse sensors, presenting a great opportunity for advancing self-supervised multimodal learning. However, current multimodal EO datasets and models focus on a single data type, either mono-date images or time series, which limits their expressivity. We introduce OmniSat, a novel architecture that exploits the spatial alignment between multiple EO modalities to learn expressive multimodal representations without labels. To demonstrate the advantages of combining modalities of different natures, we augment two existing datasets with new modalities. As demonstrated on three downstream tasks: forestry, land cover classification, and crop mapping. OmniSat can learn rich representations in an unsupervised manner, leading to improved performance in the semi- and fully-supervised settings, even when only one modality is available for inference. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/gastruc/OmniSat.</description>

      <title>OneActor: Consistent Character Generation via Cluster-Conditioned Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image generation. Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed as OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These techniques are later verified to significantly enhance the generation quality. Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid increasing inference time. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first to prove that the semantic space of the diffusion model has the same interpolation property as the latent space does. This property can serve as another promising tool for fine generation control.</description>

      <title>Establishing a Baseline for Gaze-driven Authentication Performance in VR: A Breadth-First Investigation on a Very Large Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper performs the crucial work of establishing a baseline for gaze-driven authentication performance to begin answering fundamental research questions using a very large dataset of gaze recordings from 9202 people with a level of eye tracking (ET) signal quality equivalent to modern consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) platforms. The size of the employed dataset is at least an order-of-magnitude larger than any other dataset from previous related work. Binocular estimates of the optical and visual axes of the eyes and a minimum duration for enrollment and verification are required for our model to achieve a false rejection rate (FRR) of below 3% at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1 in 50,000. In terms of identification accuracy which decreases with gallery size, we estimate that our model would fall below chance-level accuracy for gallery sizes of 148,000 or more. Our major findings indicate that gaze authentication can be as accurate as required by the FIDO standard when driven by a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture and a sufficiently large training dataset.</description>

      <title>The Brain Tumor Segmentation in Pediatrics (BraTS-PEDs) Challenge: Focus on Pediatrics (CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pediatric tumors of the central nervous system are the most common cause of cancer-related death in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade gliomas in children is less than 20%. Due to their rarity, the diagnosis of these entities is often delayed, their treatment is mainly based on historic treatment concepts, and clinical trials require multi-institutional collaborations. Here we present the CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge, focused on pediatric brain tumors with data acquired across multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. The CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge brings together clinicians and AI/imaging scientists to lead to faster development of automated segmentation techniques that could benefit clinical trials, and ultimately the care of children with brain tumors.</description>

      <title>ODMixer: Fine-grained Spatial-temporal MLP for Metro Origin-Destination Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we analyze traffic variations from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer. Our code is available at https://github.com/KLatitude/ODMixer.</description>

      <title>FAD-SAR: A Novel Fishing Activity Detection System via Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Based on Deep Learning Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities seriously affect various aspects of human life. However, traditional methods for detecting and monitoring IUU fishing activities at sea have limitations. Although synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can complement existing vessel detection systems, extracting useful information from SAR images using traditional methods remains a challenge, especially in IUU fishing. This paper proposes a deep learning based fishing activity detection system, which is implemented on the xView3 dataset using six classical object detection models: SSD, RetinaNet, FSAF, FCOS, Faster R-CNN, and Cascade R-CNN. In addition, this work employs different enhancement techniques to improve the performance of the Faster R-CNN model. The experimental results demonstrate that training the Faster R-CNN model using the Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) strategy increases the Avg-F1 value from 0.212 to 0.216.</description>

      <title>Soft Prompt Generation for Domain Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot ability on downstream tasks with manually designed prompt. To further adapt VLMs to downstream tasks, soft prompt is proposed to replace manually designed prompt, which undergoes fine-tuning based on specific domain data. Prior prompt learning methods primarily learn a fixed prompt or residuled prompt from training samples. However, the learned prompts lack diversity and ignore information about unseen domains. In this paper, we reframe the prompt learning framework from a generative perspective and propose a simple yet efficient method for the Domain Generalization (DG) task, namely Soft Prompt Generation (SPG). Specifically, SPG consists of a two-stage training phase and an inference phase. During the training phase, we introduce soft prompt label for each domain, aiming to incorporate the generative model domain knowledge. During the inference phase, the generator of the generative model is employed to obtain instance-specific soft prompts for the unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on five domain generalization benchmarks of three DG tasks demonstrate that SPG achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/renytek13/Soft-Prompt-Generation-with-CGAN.</description>

      <title>WateRF: Robust Watermarks in Radiance Fields for Protection of Copyrights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02066v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations. However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D occupancy, an advanced perception technology for driving scenarios, represents the entire scene without distinguishing between foreground and background by quantifying the physical space into a grid map. The widely adopted projection-first deformable attention, efficient in transforming image features into 3D representations, encounters challenges in aggregating multi-view features due to sensor deployment constraints. To address this issue, we propose our learning-first view attention mechanism for effective multi-view feature aggregation. Moreover, we showcase the scalability of our view attention across diverse multi-view 3D tasks, including map construction and 3D object detection. Leveraging the proposed view attention as well as an additional multi-frame streaming temporal attention, we introduce ViewFormer, a vision-centric transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal feature aggregation. To further explore occupancy-level flow representation, we present FlowOcc3D, a benchmark built on top of existing high-quality datasets. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on this benchmark reveal the potential to represent fine-grained dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. The codes are available at \url{https://github.com/ViewFormerOcc/ViewFormer-Occ}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary objective of methods in continual learning is to learn tasks in a sequential manner over time from a stream of data, while mitigating the detrimental phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we focus on learning an optimal representation between previous class prototypes and newly encountered ones. We propose a prototypical network with a Bayesian learning-driven contrastive loss (BLCL) tailored specifically for class-incremental learning scenarios. Therefore, we introduce a contrastive loss that incorporates new classes into the latent representation by reducing the intra-class distance and increasing the inter-class distance. Our approach dynamically adapts the balance between the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions with a Bayesian learning technique. Empirical evaluations conducted on both the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 dataset for image classification and images of a GNSS-based dataset for interference classification validate the efficacy of our method, showcasing its superiority over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Task-Driven Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems via Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In imaging inverse problems, one seeks to recover an image from missing/corrupted measurements. Because such problems are ill-posed, there is great motivation to quantify the uncertainty induced by the measurement-and-recovery process. Motivated by applications where the recovered image is used for a downstream task, such as soft-output classification, we propose a task-centered approach to uncertainty quantification. In particular, we use conformal prediction to construct an interval that is guaranteed to contain the task output from the true image up to a user-specified probability, and we use the width of that interval to quantify the uncertainty contributed by measurement-and-recovery. For posterior-sampling-based image recovery, we construct locally adaptive prediction intervals. Furthermore, we propose to collect measurements over multiple rounds, stopping as soon as the task uncertainty falls below an acceptable level. We demonstrate our methodology on accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): https://github.com/jwen307/TaskUQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As space missions aim to explore increasingly hazardous terrain, accurate and timely position estimates are required to ensure safe navigation. Vision-based navigation achieves this goal through correlating impact craters visible through onboard imagery with a known database to estimate a craft's pose. However, existing literature has not sufficiently evaluated crater-detection algorithm (CDA) performance from imagery containing off-nadir view angles. In this work, we evaluate the performance of Mask R-CNN for crater detection, comparing models pretrained on simulated data containing off-nadir view angles and to pretraining on real-lunar images. We demonstrate pretraining on real-lunar images is superior despite the lack of images containing off-nadir view angles, achieving detection performance of 63.1 F1-score and ellipse-regression performance of 0.701 intersection over union. This work provides the first quantitative analysis of performance of CDAs on images containing off-nadir view angles. Towards the development of increasingly robust CDAs, we additionally provide the first annotated CDA dataset with off-nadir view angles from the Chang'e 5 Landing Camera.</description>

      <title>Instant 3D Human Avatar Generation using Image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AvatarPopUp, a method for fast, high quality 3D human avatar generation from different input modalities, such as images and text prompts and with control over the generated pose and shape. The common theme is the use of diffusion-based image generation networks that are specialized for each particular task, followed by a 3D lifting network. We purposefully decouple the generation from the 3D modeling which allow us to leverage powerful image synthesis priors, trained on billions of text-image pairs. We fine-tune latent diffusion networks with additional image conditioning for image generation and back-view prediction, and to support qualitatively different multiple 3D hypotheses. Our partial fine-tuning approach allows to adapt the networks for each task without inducing catastrophic forgetting. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method produces accurate, high-quality 3D avatars with diverse appearance that respect the multimodal text, image, and body control signals. Our approach can produce a 3D model in as few as 2 seconds, a four orders of magnitude speedup wrt the vast majority of existing methods, most of which solve only a subset of our tasks, and with fewer controls. AvatarPopUp enables applications that require the controlled 3D generation of human avatars at scale. The project website can be found at https://www.nikoskolot.com/avatarpopup/.</description>

Abstract: Image-text interleaved data, consisting of multiple images and texts arranged in a natural document format, aligns with the presentation paradigm of internet data and closely resembles human reading habits. Recent studies have shown that such data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scale and diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the development of multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a 10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient data engine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain 8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts (e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales while maintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including both English and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is more flexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure text corpus and image-text pairs. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we validate the quality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed dataset. We hope this could provide a solid data foundation for future multimodal model research. Code and data are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/OmniCorpus.</description>

      <title>Glyph-ByT5-v2: A Strong Aesthetic Baseline for Accurate Multilingual Visual Text Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Glyph-ByT5 has achieved highly accurate visual text rendering performance in graphic design images. However, it still focuses solely on English and performs relatively poorly in terms of visual appeal. In this work, we address these two fundamental limitations by presenting Glyph-ByT5-v2 and Glyph-SDXL-v2, which not only support accurate visual text rendering for 10 different languages but also achieve much better aesthetic quality. To achieve this, we make the following contributions: (i) creating a high-quality multilingual glyph-text and graphic design dataset consisting of more than 1 million glyph-text pairs and 10 million graphic design image-text pairs covering nine other languages, (ii) building a multilingual visual paragraph benchmark consisting of 1,000 prompts, with 100 for each language, to assess multilingual visual spelling accuracy, and (iii) leveraging the latest step-aware preference learning approach to enhance the visual aesthetic quality. With the combination of these techniques, we deliver a powerful customized multilingual text encoder, Glyph-ByT5-v2, and a strong aesthetic graphic generation model, Glyph-SDXL-v2, that can support accurate spelling in 10 different languages. We perceive our work as a significant advancement, considering that the latest DALL-E3 and Ideogram 1.0 still struggle with the multilingual visual text rendering task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sign language translation from video to spoken text presents unique challenges owing to the distinct grammar, expression nuances, and high variation of visual appearance across different speakers and contexts. The intermediate gloss annotations of videos aim to guide the translation process. In our work, we focus on {\em Gloss2Text} translation stage and propose several advances by leveraging pre-trained large language models (LLMs), data augmentation, and novel label-smoothing loss function exploiting gloss translation ambiguities improving significantly the performance of state-of-the-art approaches. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the PHOENIX Weather 2014T dataset, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art performance in {\em Gloss2Text} translation, indicating its efficacy in addressing sign language translation and suggesting promising avenues for future research and development.</description>

      <title>LPViT: Low-Power Semi-structured Pruning for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision transformers have emerged as a promising alternative to convolutional neural networks for various image analysis tasks, offering comparable or superior performance. However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve up to 3.93x and 1.79x speedups on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and also observe an inference power reduction by 1.4x on real-world GPUs.</description>

      <title>Open Panoramic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panoramic images, capturing a 360{\deg} field of view (FoV), encompass omnidirectional spatial information crucial for scene understanding. However, it is not only costly to obtain training-sufficient dense-annotated panoramas but also application-restricted when training models in a close-vocabulary setting. To tackle this problem, in this work, we define a new task termed Open Panoramic Segmentation (OPS), where models are trained with FoV-restricted pinhole images in the source domain in an open-vocabulary setting while evaluated with FoV-open panoramic images in the target domain, enabling the zero-shot open panoramic semantic segmentation ability of models. Moreover, we propose a model named OOOPS with a Deformable Adapter Network (DAN), which significantly improves zero-shot panoramic semantic segmentation performance. To further enhance the distortion-aware modeling ability from the pinhole source domain, we propose a novel data augmentation method called Random Equirectangular Projection (RERP) which is specifically designed to address object deformations in advance. Surpassing other state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation approaches, a remarkable performance boost on three panoramic datasets, WildPASS, Stanford2D3D, and Matterport3D, proves the effectiveness of our proposed OOOPS model with RERP on the OPS task, especially +2.2% on outdoor WildPASS and +2.4% mIoU on indoor Stanford2D3D.

      <title>Data Overfitting for On-Device Super-Resolution with Dynamic Algorithm and Compiler Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are frequently employed in a variety of computer vision applications. Nowadays, an emerging trend in the current video distribution system is to take advantage of DNN's overfitting properties to perform video resolution upscaling. By splitting videos into chunks and applying a super-resolution (SR) model to overfit each chunk, this scheme of SR models plus video chunks is able to replace traditional video transmission to enhance video quality and transmission efficiency. However, many models and chunks are needed to guarantee high performance, which leads to tremendous overhead on model switching and memory footprints at the user end. To resolve such problems, we propose a Dynamic Deep neural network assisted by a Content-Aware data processing pipeline to reduce the model number down to one (Dy-DCA), which helps promote performance while conserving computational resources. Additionally, to achieve real acceleration on the user end, we designed a framework that optimizes dynamic features (e.g., dynamic shapes, sizes, and control flow) in Dy-DCA to enable a series of compilation optimizations, including fused code generation, static execution planning, etc. By employing such techniques, our method achieves better PSNR and real-time performance (33 FPS) on an off-the-shelf mobile phone. Meanwhile, assisted by our compilation optimization, we achieve a 1.7$\times$ speedup while saving up to 1.61$\times$ memory consumption.

      <title>SfM on-the-fly: Get better 3D from What You Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last twenty years, Structure from Motion (SfM) has been a constant research hotspot in the fields of photogrammetry, computer vision, robotics etc., whereas real-time performance is just a recent topic of growing interest. This work builds upon the original on-the-fly SfM (Zhan et al., 2024) and presents an updated version with three new advancements to get better 3D from what you capture: (i) real-time image matching is further boosted by employing the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs, thus more true positive overlapping image candidates are faster identified; (ii) a self-adaptive weighting strategy is proposed for robust hierarchical local bundle adjustment to improve the SfM results; (iii) multiple agents are included for supporting collaborative SfM and seamlessly merge multiple 3D reconstructions into a complete 3D scene when commonly registered images appear. Various comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SfM method (named on-the-fly SfMv2) can generate more complete and robust 3D reconstructions in a high time-efficient way.

      <title>Detect Closer Surfaces that can be Seen: New Modeling and Evaluation in Cross-domain 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of domain adaptation technologies has not yet reached an ideal level in the current 3D object detection field for autonomous driving, which is mainly due to significant differences in the size of vehicles, as well as the environments they operate in when applied across domains. These factors together hinder the effective transfer and application of knowledge learned from specific datasets. Since the existing evaluation metrics are initially designed for evaluation on a single domain by calculating the 2D or 3D overlap between the prediction and ground-truth bounding boxes, they often suffer from the overfitting problem caused by the size differences among datasets. This raises a fundamental question related to the evaluation of the 3D object detection models' cross-domain performance: Do we really need models to maintain excellent performance in their original 3D bounding boxes after being applied across domains? From a practical application perspective, one of our main focuses is actually on preventing collisions between vehicles and other obstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the size of vehicles is much more difficult. In other words, as long as a model can accurately identify the closest surfaces to the ego vehicle, it is sufficient to effectively avoid obstacles. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure 3D object detection models' ability of detecting the closer surfaces to the sensor on the ego vehicle, which can be used to evaluate their cross-domain performance more comprehensively and reasonably. Furthermore, we propose a refinement head, named EdgeHead, to guide models to focus more on the learnable closer surfaces, which can greatly improve the cross-domain performance of existing models not only under our new metrics, but even also under the original BEV/3D metrics.</description>

Abstract: Modeling, understanding, and reconstructing the real world are crucial in XR/VR. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) methods have shown remarkable success in modeling and understanding 3D scenes. Similarly, various 4D representations have demonstrated the ability to capture the dynamics of the 4D world. However, there is a dearth of research focusing on segmentation within 4D representations. In this paper, we propose Segment Any 4D Gaussians (SA4D), one of the first frameworks to segment anything in the 4D digital world based on 4D Gaussians. In SA4D, an efficient temporal identity feature field is introduced to handle Gaussian drifting, with the potential to learn precise identity features from noisy and sparse input. Additionally, a 4D segmentation refinement process is proposed to remove artifacts. Our SA4D achieves precise, high-quality segmentation within seconds in 4D Gaussians and shows the ability to remove, recolor, compose, and render high-quality anything masks. More demos are available at: https://jsxzs.github.io/sa4d/.</description>

      <title>LaSe-E2V: Towards Language-guided Semantic-Aware Event-to-Video Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras harness advantages such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR), compared to standard cameras. Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V, that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces SideSeeing, a novel initiative that provides tools and datasets for assessing the built environment. We present a framework for street-level data acquisition, loading, and analysis. Using the framework, we collected a novel dataset that integrates synchronized video footaged captured from chest-mounted mobile devices with sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and GPS). Each data sample represents a path traversed by a user filming sidewalks near hospitals in Brazil and the USA. The dataset encompasses three hours of content covering 12 kilometers around nine hospitals, and includes 325,000 video frames with corresponding sensor data. Additionally, we present a novel 68-element taxonomy specifically created for sidewalk scene identification. SideSeeing is a step towards a suite of tools that urban experts can use to perform in-depth sidewalk accessibility evaluations. SideSeeing data and tools are publicly available at https://sites.usp.br/sideseeing/.</description>

      <title>Mobius: A High Efficient Spatial-Temporal Parallel Training Paradigm for Text-to-Video Generation Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</description>

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception, interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations. Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2) embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation, covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the research community and inspire continued innovation.

      <title>A Survey of Attacks on Large Vision-Language Models: Resources, Advances, and Future Trends</title>

Abstract: With the significant development of large models in recent years, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), LVLMs present great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the multi-resource real-world applications and the complexity of multi-modal processing. However, the vulnerability of LVLMs is relatively underexplored, posing potential security risks in daily usage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the various forms of existing LVLM attacks. Specifically, we first introduce the background of attacks targeting LVLMs, including the attack preliminary, attack challenges, and attack resources. Then, we systematically review the development of LVLM attack methods, such as adversarial attacks that manipulate model outputs, jailbreak attacks that exploit model vulnerabilities for unauthorized actions, prompt injection attacks that engineer the prompt type and pattern, and data poisoning that affects model training. Finally, we discuss promising research directions in the future. We believe that our survey provides insights into the current landscape of LVLM vulnerabilities, inspiring more researchers to explore and mitigate potential safety issues in LVLM developments. The latest papers on LVLM attacks are continuously collected in https://github.com/liudaizong/Awesome-LVLM-Attack.</description>

      <title>Unified Embedding Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) is attracting increasing attention due to its ability to segment and track arbitrary objects. However, the recent Open-Vocabulary VIS attempts obtained unsatisfactory results, especially in terms of generalization ability of novel categories. We discover that the domain gap between the VLM features (e.g., CLIP) and the instance queries and the underutilization of temporal consistency are two central causes. To mitigate these issues, we design and train a novel Open-Vocabulary VIS baseline called OVFormer. OVFormer utilizes a lightweight module for unified embedding alignment between query embeddings and CLIP image embeddings to remedy the domain gap. Unlike previous image-based training methods, we conduct video-based model training and deploy a semi-online inference scheme to fully mine the temporal consistency in the video. Without bells and whistles, OVFormer achieves 21.9 mAP with a ResNet-50 backbone on LV-VIS, exceeding the previous state-of-the-art performance by 7.7. Extensive experiments on some Close-Vocabulary VIS datasets also demonstrate the strong zero-shot generalization ability of OVFormer (+ 7.6 mAP on YouTube-VIS 2019, + 3.9 mAP on OVIS). Code is available at https://github.com/fanghaook/OVFormer.</description>

      <title>Towards Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning for Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alleviating noisy pseudo labels remains a key challenge in Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL). Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.</description>

      <title>Decompose and Compare Consistency: Measuring VLMs' Answer Reliability via Task-Decomposition Consistency Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite tremendous advancements, current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are still far from perfect. They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose \textbf{De}compose and \textbf{C}ompare \textbf{C}onsistency (\texttt{DeCC}) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, \texttt{DeCC} measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show \texttt{DeCC}'s reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>EchoMimic: Lifelike Audio-Driven Portrait Animations through Editable Landmark Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area of portrait image animation, propelled by audio input, has witnessed notable progress in the generation of lifelike and dynamic portraits. Conventional methods are limited to utilizing either audios or facial key points to drive images into videos, while they can yield satisfactory results, certain issues exist. For instance, methods driven solely by audios can be unstable at times due to the relatively weaker audio signal, while methods driven exclusively by facial key points, although more stable in driving, can result in unnatural outcomes due to the excessive control of key point information. In addressing the previously mentioned challenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach which we named EchoMimic. EchoMimic is concurrently trained using both audios and facial landmarks. Through the implementation of a novel training strategy, EchoMimic is capable of generating portrait videos not only by audios and facial landmarks individually, but also by a combination of both audios and selected facial landmarks. EchoMimic has been comprehensively compared with alternative algorithms across various public datasets and our collected dataset, showcasing superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Additional visualization and access to the source code can be located on the EchoMimic project page.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Histopathology Whole Slide Image Retrieval via Distance Consistency Rehearsal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) has gained attention in recent years, offering the capability to return histopathology images that are content-wise similar to the query one from an established database. However, in clinical practice, the continuously expanding size of WSI databases limits the practical application of the current CBHIR methods. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on continuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the balance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To preserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir sampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the feature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency rehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency for previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR system. We evaluated the proposed method on four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep feature extractor for iris recognition at arbitrary resolutions. Resolution degradation reduces the recognition performance of deep learning models trained by high-resolution images. Using various-resolution images for training can improve the model's robustness while sacrificing recognition performance for high-resolution images. To achieve higher recognition performance at various resolutions, we propose a method of resolution-adaptive feature extraction with automatically switching networks. Our framework includes resolution expert modules specialized for different resolution degradations, including down-sampling and out-of-focus blurring. The framework automatically switches them depending on the degradation condition of an input image. Lower-resolution experts are trained by knowledge-distillation from the high-resolution expert in such a manner that both experts can extract common identity features. We applied our framework to three conventional neural network models. The experimental results show that our method enhances the recognition performance at low-resolution in the conventional methods and also maintains their performance at high-resolution.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of motion generation, the creation of long-duration, high-quality motion sequences remains a significant challenge. This paper presents our groundbreaking work on "Infinite Motion", a novel approach that leverages long text to extended motion generation, effectively bridging the gap between short and long-duration motion synthesis. Our core insight is the strategic extension and reassembly of existing high-quality text-motion datasets, which has led to the creation of a novel benchmark dataset to facilitate the training of models for extended motion sequences. A key innovation of our model is its ability to accept arbitrary lengths of text as input, enabling the generation of motion sequences tailored to specific narratives or scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate the timestamp design for text which allows precise editing of local segments within the generated sequences, offering unparalleled control and flexibility in motion synthesis. We further demonstrate the versatility and practical utility of "Infinite Motion" through three specific applications: natural language interactive editing, motion sequence editing within long sequences and splicing of independent motion sequences. Each application highlights the adaptability of our approach and broadens the spectrum of possibilities for research and development in motion generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model in generating long sequence motions compared to existing methods.Project page: https://shuochengzhai.github.io/Infinite-motion.github.io/</description>

      <title>Neural Poisson Solver: A Universal and Continuous Framework for Natural Signal Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has become a popular method for representing visual signals (e.g., 2D images and 3D scenes), demonstrating promising results in various downstream applications. Given its potential as a medium for visual signals, exploring the development of a neural blending method that utilizes INRs is a natural progression. Neural blending involves merging two INRs to create a new INR that encapsulates information from both original representations. A direct approach involves applying traditional image editing methods to the INR rendering process. However, this method often results in blending distortions, artifacts, and color shifts, primarily due to the discretization of the underlying pixel grid and the introduction of boundary conditions for solving variational problems. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Neural Poisson Solver, a plug-and-play and universally applicable framework across different signal dimensions for blending visual signals represented by INRs. Our Neural Poisson Solver offers a variational problem-solving approach based on the continuous Poisson equation, demonstrating exceptional performance across various domains. Specifically, we propose a gradient-guided neural solver to represent the solution process of the variational problem, refining the target signal to achieve natural blending results. We also develop a Poisson equation-based loss and optimization scheme to train our solver, ensuring it effectively blends the input INR scenes while preserving their inherent structure and semantic content. The lack of dependence on additional prior knowledge makes our method easily adaptable to various task categories, highlighting its versatility. Comprehensive experimental results validate the robustness of our approach across multiple dimensions and blending tasks.</description>

Abstract: Currently, image-text-driven multi-modal deep learning models have demonstrated their outstanding potential in many fields. In practice, tasks centered around facial images have broad application prospects. This paper presents \textbf{FaceCaption-15M}, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset of facial images accompanied by their natural language descriptions (facial image-to-text). This dataset aims to facilitate a study on face-centered tasks. FaceCaption-15M comprises over 15 million pairs of facial images and their corresponding natural language descriptions of facial features, making it the largest facial image-caption dataset to date. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of image quality, text naturalness, text complexity, and text-image relevance to demonstrate the superiority of FaceCaption-15M. To validate the effectiveness of FaceCaption-15M, we first trained a facial language-image pre-training model (FLIP, similar to CLIP) to align facial image with its corresponding captions in feature space. Subsequently, using both image and text encoders and fine-tuning only the linear layer, our FLIP-based models achieved state-of-the-art results on two challenging face-centered tasks. The purpose is to promote research in the field of face-related tasks through the availability of the proposed FaceCaption-15M dataset. All data, codes, and models are publicly available. https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenFace-CQUPT/FaceCaption-15M</description>

      <title>Anatomy-aware and acquisition-agnostic joint registration with SynthMorph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affine image registration is a cornerstone of medical image analysis. While classical algorithms can achieve excellent accuracy, they solve a time-consuming optimization for every image pair. Deep-learning (DL) methods learn a function that maps an image pair to an output transform. Evaluating the function is fast, but capturing large transforms can be challenging, and networks tend to struggle if a test-image characteristic shifts from the training domain, such as resolution. Most affine methods are agnostic to the anatomy the user wishes to align, meaning the registration will be inaccurate if algorithms consider all structures in the image. We address these shortcomings with SynthMorph, a fast, symmetric, diffeomorphic, and easy-to-use DL tool for joint affine-deformable registration of any brain image without preprocessing. First, we leverage a strategy that trains networks with widely varying images synthesized from label maps, yielding robust performance for image types unseen at training. Second, we optimize the spatial overlap of select anatomical labels. This enables networks to distinguish anatomy of interest from irrelevant structures, removing the need for preprocessing that excludes content that may impinge on anatomy-specific registration. Third, we combine the affine model with a deformable hypernetwork that lets users choose the optimal deformation-field regularity for their specific data, at registration time, in a fraction of the time required by classical methods. We analyze how competing architectures learn affine transforms and compare state-of-the-art registration tools across an extremely diverse set of neuroimaging data, aiming to truly capture the behavior of methods in the real world. SynthMorph demonstrates high accuracy and is available at https://w3id.org/synthmorph, as a single complete end-to-end solution for registration of brain MRI.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Safety Concerns in Automated Driving Perception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of deep learning and impressive performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) for perception have resulted in an increased demand for their use in automated driving (AD) systems. The safety of such systems is of utmost importance and thus requires to consider the unique properties of DNNs.
  In order to achieve safety of AD systems with DNN-based perception components in a systematic and comprehensive approach, so-called safety concerns have been introduced as a suitable structuring element. On the one hand, the concept of safety concerns is -- by design -- well aligned to existing standards relevant for safety of AD systems such as ISO 21448 (SOTIF). On the other hand, it has already inspired several academic publications and upcoming standards on AI safety such as ISO PAS 8800.
  While the concept of safety concerns has been previously introduced, this paper extends and refines it, leveraging feedback from various domain and safety experts in the field. In particular, this paper introduces an additional categorization for a better understanding as well as enabling cross-functional teams to jointly address the concerns.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Group Bias in Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning is emerging as a privacy-preserving model training approach in distributed edge applications. As such, most edge deployments are heterogeneous in nature i.e., their sensing capabilities and environments vary across deployments. This edge heterogeneity violates the independence and identical distribution (IID) property of local data across clients and produces biased global models i.e. models that contribute to unfair decision-making and discrimination against a particular community or a group. Existing bias mitigation techniques only focus on bias generated from label heterogeneity in non-IID data without accounting for domain variations due to feature heterogeneity and do not address global group-fairness property.
  Our work proposes a group-fair FL framework that minimizes group-bias while preserving privacy and without resource utilization overhead. Our main idea is to leverage average conditional probabilities to compute a cross-domain group \textit{importance weights} derived from heterogeneous training data to optimize the performance of the worst-performing group using a modified multiplicative weights update method. Additionally, we propose regularization techniques to minimize the difference between the worst and best-performing groups while making sure through our thresholding mechanism to strike a balance between bias reduction and group performance degradation. Our evaluation of human emotion recognition and image classification benchmarks assesses the fair decision-making of our framework in real-world heterogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Shortcut Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning models can extract a rich assortment of features from data. Which features a model uses depends not only on \emph{predictivity} -- how reliably a feature indicates training-set labels -- but also on \emph{availability} -- how easily the feature can be extracted from inputs. The literature on shortcut learning has noted examples in which models privilege one feature over another, for example texture over shape and image backgrounds over foreground objects. Here, we test hypotheses about which input properties are more available to a model, and systematically study how predictivity and availability interact to shape models' feature use. We construct a minimal, explicit generative framework for synthesizing classification datasets with two latent features that vary in predictivity and in factors we hypothesize to relate to availability, and we quantify a model's shortcut bias -- its over-reliance on the shortcut (more available, less predictive) feature at the expense of the core (less available, more predictive) feature. We find that linear models are relatively unbiased, but introducing a single hidden layer with ReLU or Tanh units yields a bias. Our empirical findings are consistent with a theoretical account based on Neural Tangent Kernels. Finally, we study how models used in practice trade off predictivity and availability in naturalistic datasets, discovering availability manipulations which increase models' degree of shortcut bias. Taken together, these findings suggest that the propensity to learn shortcut features is a fundamental characteristic of deep nonlinear architectures warranting systematic study given its role in shaping how models solve tasks.</description>

      <title>Any-point Trajectory Modeling for Policy Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration is a powerful method for teaching robots new skills, and having more demonstration data often improves policy learning. However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology.

      <title>Applications of artificial intelligence in the analysis of histopathology images of gliomas: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the diagnosis of gliomas has become increasingly complex. Analysis of glioma histopathology images using artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to support diagnosis and outcome prediction. To give an overview of the current state of research, this review examines 83 publicly available research studies that have proposed AI-based methods for whole-slide histopathology images of human gliomas, covering the diagnostic tasks of subtyping (23/83), grading (27/83), molecular marker prediction (20/83), and survival prediction (29/83). All studies were reviewed with regard to methodological aspects as well as clinical applicability. It was found that the focus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (52/83) are based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other datasets in isolation (16/83) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (15/83). Current approaches mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (63/83) for analyzing tissue at 20x magnification (35/83). A new field of research is the integration of clinical data, omics data, or magnetic resonance imaging (29/83). So far, AI-based methods have achieved promising results, but are not yet used in real clinical settings. Future work should focus on the independent validation of methods on larger, multi-site datasets with high-quality and up-to-date clinical and molecular pathology annotations to demonstrate routine applicability.</description>

      <title>A Spatio-temporal Aligned SUNet Model for Low-light Video Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distortions caused by low-light conditions are not only visually unpleasant but also degrade the performance of computer vision tasks. The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Information about CLinical Artificial Intelligence Checklist for Generative Modeling Research (MI-CLAIM-GEN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, including large language models (LLMs), vision language models (VLMs), and diffusion models, have accelerated the field of natural language and image processing in medicine and marked a significant paradigm shift in how biomedical models can be developed and deployed. While these models are highly adaptable to new tasks, scaling and evaluating their usage presents new challenges not addressed in previous frameworks. In particular, the ability of these models to produce useful outputs with little to no specialized training data ("zero-" or "few-shot" approaches), as well as the open-ended nature of their outputs, necessitate the development of new guidelines for robust reporting of clinical generative model research. In response to gaps in standards and best practices for the development of clinical AI tools identified by US Executive Order 141103 and several emerging national networks for clinical AI evaluation, we begin to formalize some of these guidelines by building on the original MI-CLAIM checklist. The new checklist, MI-CLAIM-GEN (Table 1), aims to address differences in training, evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility of new generative models compared to non-generative ("predictive") AI models. This MI-CLAIM-GEN checklist also seeks to clarify cohort selection reporting with unstructured clinical data and adds additional items on alignment with ethical standards for clinical AI research.</description>

      <title>StainFuser: Controlling Diffusion for Faster Neural Style Transfer in Multi-Gigapixel Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stain normalization algorithms aim to transform the color and intensity characteristics of a source multi-gigapixel histology image to match those of a target image, mitigating inconsistencies in the appearance of stains used to highlight cellular components in the images. We propose a new approach, StainFuser, which treats this problem as a style transfer task using a novel Conditional Latent Diffusion architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted color components. With this method, we curate SPI-2M the largest stain normalization dataset to date of over 2 million histology images with neural style transfer for high-quality transformations. Trained on this data, StainFuser outperforms current state-of-the-art deep learning and handcrafted methods in terms of the quality of normalized images and in terms of downstream model performance on the CoNIC dataset.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Deep Causal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing models that are capable of answering questions of the form "How would x change if y had been z?'" is fundamental to advancing medical image analysis. Training causal generative models that address such counterfactual questions, though, currently requires that all relevant variables have been observed and that the corresponding labels are available in the training data. However, clinical data may not have complete records for all patients and state of the art causal generative models are unable to take full advantage of this. We thus develop, for the first time, a semi-supervised deep causal generative model that exploits the causal relationships between variables to maximise the use of all available data. We explore this in the setting where each sample is either fully labelled or fully unlabelled, as well as the more clinically realistic case of having different labels missing for each sample. We leverage techniques from causal inference to infer missing values and subsequently generate realistic counterfactuals, even for samples with incomplete labels.</description>

      <title>GraspXL: Generating Grasping Motions for Diverse Objects at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human hands possess the dexterity to interact with diverse objects such as grasping specific parts of the objects and/or approaching them from desired directions. More importantly, humans can grasp objects of any shape without object-specific skills. Recent works synthesize grasping motions following single objectives such as a desired approach heading direction or a grasping area. Moreover, they usually rely on expensive 3D hand-object data during training and inference, which limits their capability to synthesize grasping motions for unseen objects at scale. In this paper, we unify the generation of hand-object grasping motions across multiple motion objectives, diverse object shapes and dexterous hand morphologies in a policy learning framework GraspXL. The objectives are composed of the graspable area, heading direction during approach, wrist rotation, and hand position. Without requiring any 3D hand-object interaction data, our policy trained with 58 objects can robustly synthesize diverse grasping motions for more than 500k unseen objects with a success rate of 82.2%. At the same time, the policy adheres to objectives, which enables the generation of diverse grasps per object. Moreover, we show that our framework can be deployed to different dexterous hands and work with reconstructed or generated objects. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our method to show the efficacy of our approach. Our model, code, and the large-scale generated motions are available at https://eth-ait.github.io/graspxl/.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Advancing Medical Image Segmentation with Mini-Net: A Lightweight Solution Tailored for Efficient Segmentation of Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures and abnormalities in medical images is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis and analysis. While deep learning techniques excel at this task, their computational demands pose challenges. Additionally, some cutting-edge segmentation methods, though effective for general object segmentation, may not be optimised for medical images. To address these issues, we propose Mini-Net, a lightweight segmentation network specifically designed for medical images. With fewer than 38,000 parameters, Mini-Net efficiently captures both high- and low-frequency features, enabling real-time applications in various medical imaging scenarios. We evaluate Mini-Net on various datasets, including DRIVE, STARE, ISIC-2016, ISIC-2018, and MoNuSeg, demonstrating its robustness and good performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Improving Alignment and Robustness with Circuit Breakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04313v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputs with "circuit breakers." Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breaking directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image "hijacks" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Single-Slice Segmentation with 3D-to-2D Unpaired Scan Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2D single-slice abdominal computed tomography (CT) enables the assessment of body habitus and organ health with low radiation exposure. However, single-slice data necessitates the use of 2D networks for segmentation, but these networks often struggle to capture contextual information effectively. Consequently, even when trained on identical datasets, 3D networks typically achieve superior segmentation results. In this work, we propose a novel 3D-to-2D distillation framework, leveraging pre-trained 3D models to enhance 2D single-slice segmentation. Specifically, we extract the prediction distribution centroid from the 3D representations, to guide the 2D student by learning intra- and inter-class correlation. Unlike traditional knowledge distillation methods that require the same data input, our approach employs unpaired 3D CT scans with any contrast to guide the 2D student model. Experiments conducted on 707 subjects from the single-slice Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) dataset demonstrate that state-of-the-art 2D multi-organ segmentation methods can benefit from the 3D teacher model, achieving enhanced performance in single-slice multi-organ segmentation. Notably, our approach demonstrates considerable efficacy in low-data regimes, outperforming the model trained with all available training subjects even when utilizing only 200 training subjects. Thus, this work underscores the potential to alleviate manual annotation burdens.</description>

      <title>ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</description>

      <title>X-ray2CTPA: Generating 3D CTPA scans from 2D X-ray conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chest X-rays or chest radiography (CXR), commonly used for medical diagnostics, typically enables limited imaging compared to computed tomography (CT) scans, which offer more detailed and accurate three-dimensional data, particularly contrast-enhanced scans like CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA). However, CT scans entail higher costs, greater radiation exposure, and are less accessible than CXRs. In this work we explore cross-modal translation from a 2D low contrast-resolution X-ray input to a 3D high contrast and spatial-resolution CTPA scan. Driven by recent advances in generative AI, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach to this task. We evaluate the models performance using both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from radiologists, ensuring diagnostic relevance of the generated images. Furthermore, we employ the synthesized 3D images in a classification framework and show improved AUC in a PE categorization task, using the initial CXR input. The proposed method is generalizable and capable of performing additional cross-modality translations in medical imaging. It may pave the way for more accessible and cost-effective advanced diagnostic tools. The code for this project is available: https://github.com/NoaCahan/X-ray2CTPA .</description>

      <title>RoboUniView: Visual-Language Model with Unified View Representation for Robotic Manipulaiton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for robotic manipulation represents a novel paradigm, aiming to enhance the model's ability to generalize to new objects and instructions. However, due to variations in camera specifications and mounting positions, existing methods exhibit significant performance disparities across different robotic platforms. To address this challenge, we propose RoboUniView in this paper, an innovative approach that decouples visual feature extraction from action learning. We first learn a unified view representation from multi-perspective views by pre-training on readily accessible data, and then derive actions from this unified view representation to control robotic manipulation. This unified view representation more accurately mirrors the physical world and is not constrained by the robotic platform's camera parameters. Thanks to this methodology, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the demanding CALVIN benchmark, enhancing the success rate in the $D \to D$ setting from 93.0% to 96.2%, and in the $ABC \to D$ setting from 92.2% to 94.2%. Moreover, our model exhibits outstanding adaptability and flexibility: it maintains high performance under unseen camera parameters, can utilize multiple datasets with varying camera parameters, and is capable of joint cross-task learning across datasets. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/liufanfanlff/RoboUniview</description>

      <title>Structured Generations: Using Hierarchical Clusters to guide Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Diffuse-TreeVAE, a deep generative model that integrates hierarchical clustering into the framework of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). The proposed approach generates new images by sampling from a root embedding of a learned latent tree VAE-based structure, it then propagates through hierarchical paths, and utilizes a second-stage DDPM to refine and generate distinct, high-quality images for each data cluster. The result is a model that not only improves image clarity but also ensures that the generated samples are representative of their respective clusters, addressing the limitations of previous VAE-based methods and advancing the state of clustering-based generative modeling.</description>

Abstract: Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro are powering countless image-text applications and scoring high on many vision-understanding benchmarks. We propose BlindTest, a suite of 7 visual tasks absurdly easy to humans such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting the number of circles in a Olympic-like logo. Surprisingly, four state-of-the-art VLMs are, on average, only 56.20% accurate on our benchmark, with \newsonnet being the best (73.77% accuracy). On BlindTest, VLMs struggle with tasks that requires precise spatial information and counting (from 0 to 10), sometimes providing an impression of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry and making educated guesses.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PredBench, a benchmark tailored for the holistic evaluation of spatio-temporal prediction networks. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a lack of a standardized framework for a detailed and comparative analysis of various prediction network architectures. PredBench addresses this gap by conducting large-scale experiments, upholding standardized and appropriate experimental settings, and implementing multi-dimensional evaluations. This benchmark integrates 12 widely adopted methods with 15 diverse datasets across multiple application domains, offering extensive evaluation of contemporary spatio-temporal prediction networks. Through meticulous calibration of prediction settings across various applications, PredBench ensures evaluations relevant to their intended use and enables fair comparisons. Moreover, its multi-dimensional evaluation framework broadens the analysis with a comprehensive set of metrics, providing deep insights into the capabilities of models. The findings from our research offer strategic directions for future developments in the field. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/OpenEarthLab/PredBench.</description>
