      <title>CATArena: Evaluation of LLM Agents through Iterative Tournament Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have evolved from basic text generation to autonomously completing complex tasks through interaction with external tools. However, current benchmarks mainly assess end-to-end performance in fixed scenarios, restricting evaluation to specific skills and suffering from score saturation and growing dependence on expert annotation as agent capabilities improve. In this work, we emphasize the importance of learning ability, including both self-improvement and peer-learning, as a core driver for agent evolution toward human-level intelligence. We propose an iterative, competitive peer-learning framework, which allows agents to refine and optimize their strategies through repeated interactions and feedback, thereby systematically evaluating their learning capabilities. To address the score saturation issue in current benchmarks, we introduce CATArena, a tournament-style evaluation platform featuring four diverse board and card games with open-ended scoring. By providing tasks without explicit upper score limits, CATArena enables continuous and dynamic evaluation of rapidly advancing agent capabilities. Experimental results and analyses involving both minimal and commercial code agents demonstrate that CATArena provides reliable, stable, and scalable benchmarking for core agent abilities, particularly learning ability and strategy coding.</description>

      <title>Inverse Knowledge Search over Verifiable Reasoning: Synthesizing a Scientific Encyclopedia from a Long Chains-of-Thought Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most scientific materials compress reasoning, presenting conclusions while omitting the derivational chains that justify them. This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.</description>

      <title>The Denario project: Deep knowledge AI agents for scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.</description>

      <title>Cognition Envelopes for Bounded AI Reasoning in Autonomous UAS Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on Foundational Models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to increase autonomy through enhanced perception, inference, and planning. However, these models also introduce new types of errors, such as hallucinations, overgeneralizations, and context misalignments, resulting in incorrect and flawed decisions. To address this, we introduce the concept of Cognition Envelopes, designed to establish reasoning boundaries that constrain AI-generated decisions while complementing the use of meta-cognition and traditional safety envelopes. As with safety envelopes, Cognition Envelopes require practical guidelines and systematic processes for their definition, validation, and assurance.</description>

      <title>Causal Masking on Spatial Data: An Information-Theoretic Case for Learning Spatial Datasets with Unimodal Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models are traditionally designed around causal masking. In domains with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which naturally supports both representations. We train language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models trained on spatial board states - \textit{even with causal masking} - consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.</description>

      <title>e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Data Flywheel: Applying MAPE Control Loops to AI Agent Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise AI agents must continuously adapt to maintain accuracy, reduce latency, and remain aligned with user needs. We present a practical implementation of a data flywheel in NVInfo AI, NVIDIA's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Knowledge Assistant serving over 30,000 employees. By operationalizing a MAPE-driven data flywheel, we built a closed-loop system that systematically addresses failures in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and enables continuous learning. Over a 3-month post-deployment period, we monitored feedback and collected 495 negative samples. Analysis revealed two major failure modes: routing errors (5.25\%) and query rephrasal errors (3.2\%). Using NVIDIA NeMo microservices, we implemented targeted improvements through fine-tuning. For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size, and 70\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\% gain in accuracy and a 40\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel, transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback, navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production. This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale.</description>

      <title>CombiGraph-Vis: A Curated Multimodal Olympiad Benchmark for Discrete Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code, data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Glia: A Human-Inspired AI for Automated Systems Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can an AI autonomously design mechanisms for computer systems on par with the creativity and reasoning of human experts? We present Glia, an AI architecture for networked systems design that uses large language models (LLMs) in a human-inspired, multi-agent workflow. Each agent specializes in reasoning, experimentation, and analysis, collaborating through an evaluation framework that grounds abstract reasoning in empirical feedback. Unlike prior ML-for-systems methods that optimize black-box policies, Glia generates interpretable designs and exposes its reasoning process. When applied to a distributed GPU cluster for LLM inference, it produces new algorithms for request routing, scheduling, and auto-scaling that perform at human-expert levels in significantly less time, while yielding novel insights into workload behavior. Our results suggest that by combining reasoning LLMs with structured experimentation, an AI can produce creative and understandable designs for complex systems problems.</description>

      <title>From product to system network challenges in system of systems lifecycle management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, products are no longer isolated artifacts, but nodes in networked systems. This means that traditional, linearly conceived life cycle models are reaching their limits: Interoperability across disciplines, variant and configuration management, traceability, and governance across organizational boundaries are becoming key factors. This collective contribution classifies the state of the art and proposes a practical frame of reference for SoS lifecycle management, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) as the semantic backbone, product lifecycle management (PLM) as the governance and configuration level, CAD-CAE as model-derived domains, and digital thread and digital twin as continuous feedback. Based on current literature and industry experience, mobility, healthcare, and the public sector, we identify four principles: (1) referenced architecture and data models, (2) end-to-end configuration sovereignty instead of tool silos, (3) curated models with clear review gates, and (4) measurable value contributions along time, quality, cost, and sustainability. A three-step roadmap shows the transition from product- to network- centric development: piloting with reference architecture, scaling across variant and supply chain spaces, organizational anchoring (roles, training, compliance). The results are increased change robustness, shorter throughput times, improved reuse, and informed sustainability decisions. This article is aimed at decision-makers and practitioners who want to make complexity manageable and design SoS value streams to be scalable.</description>

      <title>Fints: Efficient Inference-Time Personalization for LLMs with Fine-Grained Instance-Tailored Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the demand for effective personalization techniques that can adapt model behavior to individual user preferences. Despite the non-parametric methods utilizing the in-context learning ability of LLMs, recent parametric adaptation methods, including personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning and reward modeling emerge. However, these methods face limitations in handling dynamic user patterns and high data sparsity scenarios, due to low adaptability and data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained and instance-tailored steering framework that dynamically generates sample-level interference vectors from user data and injects them into the model's forward pass for personalized adaptation. Our approach introduces two key technical innovations: a fine-grained steering component that captures nuanced signals by hooking activations from attention and MLP layers, and an input-aware aggregation module that synthesizes these signals into contextually relevant enhancements. The method demonstrates high flexibility and data efficiency, excelling in fast-changing distribution and high data sparsity scenarios. In addition, the proposed method is orthogonal to existing methods and operates as a plug-in component compatible with different personalization techniques. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios--including short-to-long text generation, and web function calling--validate the effectiveness and compatibility of our approach. Results show that our method significantly enhances personalization performance in fast-shifting environments while maintaining robustness across varying interaction modes and context lengths.

      <title>GUI-Rise: Structured Reasoning and History Summarization for GUI Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced GUI navigation agents, current approaches face limitations in cross-domain generalization and effective history utilization. We present a reasoning-enhanced framework that systematically integrates structured reasoning, action prediction, and history summarization. The structured reasoning component generates coherent Chain-of-Thought analyses combining progress estimation and decision reasoning, which inform both immediate action predictions and compact history summaries for future steps. Based on this framework, we train a GUI agent, \textbf{GUI-Rise}, through supervised fine-tuning on pseudo-labeled trajectories and reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework employs specialized rewards, including a history-aware objective, directly linking summary quality to subsequent action performance. Comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art results under identical training data conditions, with particularly strong performance in out-of-domain scenarios. These findings validate our framework's ability to maintain robust reasoning and generalization across diverse GUI navigation tasks.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Long-Horizon Unordered Tasks: From Boolean to Coupled Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) inform reinforcement learning agents about the reward structure of the environment. This is particularly advantageous for complex non-Markovian tasks because agents with access to RMs can learn more efficiently from fewer samples. However, learning with RMs is ill-suited for long-horizon problems in which a set of subtasks can be executed in any order. In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3) Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda. Furthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages coupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM). Our experiments show that CoRM scales better than state-of-the-art RM algorithms for long-horizon problems with unordered subtasks.</description>

      <title>Discriminative Rule Learning for Outcome-Guided Process Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event logs extracted from information systems offer a rich foundation for understanding and improving business processes. In many real-world applications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable process executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant behavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations, delays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and visualizing critical process patterns.</description>

      <title>An In-depth Study of LLM Contributions to the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide interesting ideas contributing to mathematical discovery. This claim was motivated by reports that LLM-based genetic algorithms produced heuristics offering new insights into the online bin packing problem under uniform and Weibull distributions. In this work, we reassess this claim through a detailed analysis of the heuristics produced by LLMs, examining both their behavior and interpretability. Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied. Our findings instead emphasize the need for rigorous validation and contextualization when assessing the scientific value of LLM-generated outputs.</description>

      <title>ToolScope: An Agentic Framework for Vision-Guided and Long-Horizon Tool Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities by autonomously integrating with external tools for collaborative reasoning. However, due to the inherently complex and diverse nature of multimodal information, enabling multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to flexibly and efficiently utilize external tools during reasoning remains an underexplored challenge. In this work, we introduce ToolScope, an agentic framework designed to unify global planning with local multimodal perception, adopting a specialized Perceive tool to mitigates visual context degradation in long-horizon VQA task. ToolScope comprises three primary components: the Global Navigator, the Agentic Executor, and the Response Synthesizer. The Global Navigator functions as a "telescope", offering high-level strategic guidance. The Agentic Executor operates iteratively to augment MLLM with local perception through the integration of external tools-Search, Code, and Perceive. Finally, the Response Synthesizer consolidates and organizes the reasoning process into a coherent, user-friendly output. We evaluate ToolScope on four VQA benchmarks across diverse domains, including VQA 2.0, ScienceQA, MAT-Search and MathVista. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, achieving an average performance improvement of up to +6.69% across all datasets.</description>

      <title>Realistic pedestrian-driver interaction modelling using multi-agent RL with human perceptual-motor constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling pedestrian-driver interactions is critical for understanding human road user behaviour and developing safe autonomous vehicle systems. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or 'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints, two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for simulating realistic road user interactions.</description>

      <title>Dialogue as Discovery: Navigating Human Intent Through Principled Inquiry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental bottleneck in human-AI collaboration is the "intention expression gap," the difficulty for humans to effectively convey complex, high-dimensional thoughts to AI. This challenge often traps users in inefficient trial-and-error loops and is exacerbated by the diverse expertise levels of users. We reframe this problem from passive instruction following to a Socratic collaboration paradigm, proposing an agent that actively probes for information to resolve its uncertainty about user intent. we name the proposed agent Nous, trained to acquire proficiency in this inquiry policy. The core mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to varying user expertise. Moreover, its design is domain-agnostic, and we show evidence of generalization beyond diagram generation. Experimental results prove that our work offers a principled, scalable, and adaptive paradigm for resolving uncertainty about user intent in complex human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>DeepCompress: A Dual Reward Strategy for Dynamically Exploring and Compressing Reasoning Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities but suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like ``overthinking'' simple problems and ``underthinking'' complex ones. While existing methods that use supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) or reinforcement learning~(RL) with token-length rewards can improve efficiency, they often do so at the cost of accuracy. This paper introduces \textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency.</description>

      <title>GeoFM: Enhancing Geometric Reasoning of MLLMs via Synthetic Data Generation through Formal Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention in both academia and industry for their capabilities in handling multi-modal tasks. However, these models face challenges in mathematical geometric reasoning due to the scarcity of high-quality geometric data. To address this issue, synthetic geometric data has become an essential strategy. Current methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create geometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data that lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate significantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses formal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space, generating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals while ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show that our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model trained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\% on geometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\% on GeoQA. Additionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by 5.7\% on MathVista and by 2.7\% on GeoQA.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of Learned Reasoning 1: TempoBench, A Benchmark for Interpretable Deconstruction of Reasoning System Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE) tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score 65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity increases. Our code is available at our \href{https://github.com/nik-hz/tempobench}{GitHub repository}.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge Integration for Agentic Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving mathematical reasoning problems requires not only accurate access to relevant knowledge but also careful, multi-step thinking. However, current retrieval-augmented models often rely on a single perspective, follow inflexible search strategies, and struggle to effectively combine information from multiple sources. We introduce SIGMA (Search-Augmented On-Demand Knowledge Integration for AGentic Mathematical reAsoning), a unified framework that orchestrates specialized agents to independently reason, perform targeted searches, and synthesize findings through a moderator mechanism. Each agent generates hypothetical passages to optimize retrieval for its analytic perspective, ensuring knowledge integration is both context-sensitive and computation-efficient. When evaluated on challenging benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME, and PhD-level science QA GPQA, SIGMA consistently outperforms both open- and closed-source systems, achieving an absolute performance improvement of 7.4%. Our results demonstrate that multi-agent, on-demand knowledge integration significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for complex, knowledge-intensive problem-solving. We will release the code upon publication.</description>

      <title>InnovatorBench: Evaluating Agents' Ability to Conduct Innovative LLM Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27598v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents could accelerate scientific discovery by automating hypothesis formation, experiment design, coding, execution, and analysis, yet existing benchmarks probe narrow skills in simplified settings. To address this gap, we introduce InnovatorBench, a benchmark-platform pair for realistic, end-to-end assessment of agents performing Large Language Model (LLM) research. It comprises 20 tasks spanning Data Construction, Filtering, Augmentation, Loss Design, Reward Design, and Scaffold Construction, which require runnable artifacts and assessment of correctness, performance, output quality, and uncertainty. To support agent operation, we develop ResearchGym, a research environment offering rich action spaces, distributed and long-horizon execution, asynchronous monitoring, and snapshot saving. We also implement a lightweight ReAct agent that couples explicit reasoning with executable planning using frontier models such as Claude-4, GPT-5, GLM-4.5, and Kimi-K2. Our experiments demonstrate that while frontier models show promise in code-driven research tasks, they struggle with fragile algorithm-related tasks and long-horizon decision making, such as impatience, poor resource management, and overreliance on template-based reasoning. Furthermore, agents require over 11 hours to achieve their best performance on InnovatorBench, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty and showing the potential of InnovatorBench to be the next generation of code-based research benchmark.</description>

      <title>VeriMoA: A Mixture-of-Agents Framework for Spec-to-HDL Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) design can help developers meet increasing computational demands. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, but face challenges due to limited parametric knowledge and domain-specific constraints. While prompt engineering and fine-tuning have limitations in knowledge coverage and training costs, multi-agent architectures offer a training-free paradigm to enhance reasoning through collaborative generation. However, current multi-agent approaches suffer from two critical deficiencies: susceptibility to noise propagation and constrained reasoning space exploration. We propose VeriMoA, a training-free mixture-of-agents (MoA) framework with two synergistic innovations. First, a quality-guided caching mechanism to maintain all intermediate HDL outputs and enables quality-based ranking and selection across the entire generation process, encouraging knowledge accumulation over layers of reasoning. Second, a multi-path generation strategy that leverages C++ and Python as intermediate representations, decomposing specification-to-HDL translation into two-stage processes that exploit LLM fluency in high-resource languages while promoting solution diversity. Comprehensive experiments on VerilogEval 2.0 and RTLLM 2.0 benchmarks demonstrate that VeriMoA achieves 15--30% improvements in Pass@1 across diverse LLM backbones, especially enabling smaller models to match larger models and fine-tuned alternatives without requiring costly training.</description>

      <title>Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Validity Is What You Need</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While AI agents have long been discussed and studied in computer science, today's Agentic AI systems are something new. We consider other definitions of Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models. Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more interpretable models that handle core logic. When it comes to Agentic AI, validity is what you need. LLMs are one option that might achieve it.</description>

      <title>Interaction as Intelligence Part II: Asynchronous Human-Agent Rollout for Long-Horizon Task Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27630v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have recently shown strong potential in domains such as automated coding, deep research, and graphical user interface manipulation. However, training them to succeed on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering. Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks.</description>

      <title>MolChord: Structure-Sequence Alignment for Protein-Guided Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), which maps target proteins to candidate molecular ligands, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Effectively aligning protein structural representations with molecular representations, and ensuring alignment between generated drugs and their pharmacological properties, remains a critical challenge. To address these challenges, we propose MolChord, which integrates two key techniques: (1) to align protein and molecule structures with their textual descriptions and sequential representations (e.g., FASTA for proteins and SMILES for molecules), we leverage NatureLM, an autoregressive model unifying text, small molecules, and proteins, as the molecule generator, alongside a diffusion-based structure encoder; and (2) to guide molecules toward desired properties, we curate a property-aware dataset by integrating preference data and refine the alignment process using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on CrossDocked2020 demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on key evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a practical tool for SBDD.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural architecture search space using ResNet as a framework, with search objectives including parameters for convolution, pooling, fully connected layers, and connectivity of the residual network. In addition to recognition accuracy, this paper uses the loss value on the validation set as a secondary objective for optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the search space of this paper together with the optimisation approach can find competitive network architectures on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural architecture search method based on Transformer architecture, searching cross multihead attention computation ways for different number of encoder and decoder combinations. In order to search for neural network structures with better translation results, we considered perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation metric.</description>

      <title>Detecting Prefix Bias in LLM-based Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13487v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.</description>

      <title>VeriStruct: AI-assisted Automated Verification of Data-Structure Modules in Verus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VeriStruct, a novel framework that extends AI-assisted automated verification from single functions to more complex data structure modules in Verus. VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors. In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic AI-assisted formal verification.</description>

      <title>EARS-UDE: Evaluating Auditory Response in Sensory Overload with Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory sensory overload affects 50-70% of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), yet existing approaches, such as mechanistic models (Hodgkin Huxley type, Wilson Cowan, excitation inhibition balance), clinical tools (EEG/MEG, Sensory Profile scales), and ML methods (Neural ODEs, predictive coding), either assume fixed parameters or lack interpretability, missing autism heterogeneity. We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Accelerator Beamline Control: a simulation-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle accelerators play a pivotal role in advancing scientific research, yet optimizing beamline configurations to maximize particle transmission remains a labor-intensive task requiring expert intervention. In this work, we introduce RLABC (Reinforcement Learning for Accelerator Beamline Control), a Python-based library that reframes beamline optimization as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Leveraging the Elegant simulation framework, RLABC automates the creation of an RL environment from standard lattice and element input files, enabling sequential tuning of magnets to minimize particle losses. We define a comprehensive state representation capturing beam statistics, actions for adjusting magnet parameters, and a reward function focused on transmission efficiency. Employing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, we demonstrate RLABC's efficacy on two beamlines, achieving transmission rates of 94% and 91%, comparable to expert manual optimizations. This approach bridges accelerator physics and machine learning, offering a versatile tool for physicists and RL researchers alike to streamline beamline tuning.</description>

      <title>Impact of clinical decision support systems (cdss) on clinical outcomes and healthcare delivery in low- and middle-income countries: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are used to improve clinical and service outcomes, yet evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is dispersed. This protocol outlines methods to quantify the impact of CDSS on patient and healthcare delivery outcomes in LMICs. We will include comparative quantitative designs (randomized trials, controlled before-after, interrupted time series, comparative cohorts) evaluating CDSS in World Bank-defined LMICs. Standalone qualitative studies are excluded; mixed-methods studies are eligible only if they report comparative quantitative outcomes, for which we will extract the quantitative component. Searches (from inception to 30 September 2024) will cover MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Global Health, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, LILACS, African Index Medicus, and IndMED, plus grey sources. Screening and extraction will be performed in duplicate. Risk of bias will be assessed with RoB 2 (randomized trials) and ROBINS-I (non-randomized). Random-effects meta-analysis will be performed where outcomes are conceptually or statistically comparable; otherwise, a structured narrative synthesis will be presented. Heterogeneity will be explored using relative and absolute metrics and a priori subgroups or meta-regression (condition area, care level, CDSS type, readiness proxies, study design).</description>

      <title>Systematic Absence of Low-Confidence Nighttime Fire Detections in VIIRS Active Fire Product: Evidence of Undocumented Algorithmic Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire product is widely used for global fire monitoring, yet its confidence classification scheme exhibits an undocumented systematic pattern. Through analysis of 21,540,921 fire detections spanning one year (January 2023 - January 2024), I demonstrate a complete absence of low-confidence classifications during nighttime observations. Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence (chi-squared = 1,474,795, p &lt; 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites. Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation (1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon. Brightness temperature analysis reveals nighttime fires below approximately 295K are likely excluded entirely rather than flagged as low-confidence, while daytime fires show normal confidence distributions. This undocumented behavior affects 27.9% of all VIIRS fire detections and has significant implications for fire risk assessment, day-night detection comparisons, confidence-weighted analyses, and any research treating confidence levels as uncertainty metrics. I recommend explicit documentation of this algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and reprocessing strategies for affected analyses.</description>

      <title>GACA-DiT: Diffusion-based Dance-to-Music Generation with Genre-Adaptive Rhythm and Context-Aware Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dance-to-music (D2M) generation aims to automatically compose music that is rhythmically and temporally aligned with dance movements. Existing methods typically rely on coarse rhythm embeddings, such as global motion features or binarized joint-based rhythm values, which discard fine-grained motion cues and result in weak rhythmic alignment. Moreover, temporal mismatches introduced by feature downsampling further hinder precise synchronization between dance and music. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{GACA-DiT}, a diffusion transformer-based framework with two novel modules for rhythmically consistent and temporally aligned music generation. First, a \textbf{genre-adaptive rhythm extraction} module combines multi-scale temporal wavelet analysis and spatial phase histograms with adaptive joint weighting to capture fine-grained, genre-specific rhythm patterns. Second, a \textbf{context-aware temporal alignment} module resolves temporal mismatches using learnable context queries to align music latents with relevant dance rhythm features. Extensive experiments on the AIST++ and TikTok datasets demonstrate that GACA-DiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective metrics and human evaluation.

      <title>See the Speaker: Crafting High-Resolution Talking Faces from Speech with Prior Guidance and Region Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike existing methods that rely on source images as appearance references and use source speech to generate motion, this work proposes a novel approach that directly extracts information from the speech, addressing key challenges in speech-to-talking face. Specifically, we first employ a speech-to-face portrait generation stage, utilizing a speech-conditioned diffusion model combined with statistical facial prior and a sample-adaptive weighting module to achieve high-quality portrait generation. In the subsequent speech-driven talking face generation stage, we embed expressive dynamics such as lip movement, facial expressions, and eye movements into the latent space of the diffusion model and further optimize lip synchronization using a region-enhancement module. To generate high-resolution outputs, we integrate a pre-trained Transformer-based discrete codebook with an image rendering network, enhancing video frame details in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on the HDTF, VoxCeleb, and AVSpeech datasets. Notably, this is the first method capable of generating high-resolution, high-quality talking face videos exclusively from a single speech input.</description>

      <title>Cross-Corpus Validation of Speech Emotion Recognition in Urdu using Domain-Knowledge Acoustic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a key affective computing technology that enables emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence. While SER is challenging in general, it is particularly difficult for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This study investigates Urdu SER in a cross-corpus setting, an area that has remained largely unexplored. We employ a cross-corpus evaluation framework across three different Urdu emotional speech datasets to test model generalization. Two standard domain-knowledge based acoustic feature sets, eGeMAPS and ComParE, are used to represent speech signals as feature vectors which are then passed to Logistic Regression and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers. Classification performance is assessed using unweighted average recall (UAR) whilst considering class-label imbalance. Results show that Self-corpus validation often overestimates performance, with UAR exceeding cross-corpus evaluation by up to 13%, underscoring that cross-corpus evaluation offers a more realistic measure of model robustness. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of cross-corpus validation for Urdu SER and its implications contribute to advancing affective computing research for underrepresented language communities.</description>

      <title>LeMat-Synth: a multi-modal toolbox to curate broad synthesis procedure databases from scientific literature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of synthesis procedures remains a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, with procedural knowledge scattered across decades of scientific literature in unstructured formats that are challenging for systematic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal toolbox that employs large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to automatically extract and organize synthesis procedures and performance data from materials science publications, covering text and figures. We curated 81k open-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing synthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes, structured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The extraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis procedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable LLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source software library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora and synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible infrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable information. This lays the groundwork for predictive modeling of synthesis procedures as well as modeling synthesis--structure--property relationships.</description>

Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications. Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images. Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma range (5 -&gt; 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11 to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>VISAT: Benchmarking Adversarial and Distribution Shift Robustness in Traffic Sign Recognition with Visual Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VISAT, a novel open dataset and benchmarking suite for evaluating model robustness in the task of traffic sign recognition with the presence of visual attributes. Built upon the Mapillary Traffic Sign Dataset (MTSD), our dataset introduces two benchmarks that respectively emphasize robustness against adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. For our adversarial attack benchmark, we employ the state-of-the-art Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) method to generate adversarial inputs and evaluate their impact on popular models. Additionally, we investigate the effect of adversarial attacks on attribute-specific multi-task learning (MTL) networks, revealing spurious correlations among MTL tasks. The MTL networks leverage visual attributes (color, shape, symbol, and text) that we have created for each traffic sign in our dataset. For our distribution shift benchmark, we utilize ImageNet-C's realistic data corruption and natural variation techniques to perform evaluations on the robustness of both base and MTL models. Moreover, we further explore spurious correlations among MTL tasks through synthetic alterations of traffic sign colors using color quantization techniques. Our experiments focus on two major backbones, ResNet-152 and ViT-B/32, and compare the performance between base and MTL models. The VISAT dataset and benchmarking framework contribute to the understanding of model robustness for traffic sign recognition, shedding light on the challenges posed by adversarial attacks and distribution shifts. We believe this work will facilitate advancements in developing more robust models for real-world applications in autonomous driving and cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Generation of Minimally Preprocessed Brain MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406 subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected. Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment, the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images. All model weights and corresponding inference code are publicly available at https://github.com/piksl-research/medforj .</description>

      <title>Category-Aware Semantic Caching for Heterogeneous LLM Workloads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM serving systems process heterogeneous query workloads where different categories exhibit different characteristics. Code queries cluster densely in embedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content staleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query repetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation), producing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories achieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve 5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote search costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of production traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem: fixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid paraphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This paper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds, TTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture separating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss cost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories economically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage across the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend this framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting thresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in theoretical projections.</description>

      <title>SpotIt: Evaluating Text-to-SQL Evaluation with Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community-driven Text-to-SQL evaluation platforms play a pivotal role in tracking the state of the art of Text-to-SQL performance. The reliability of the evaluation process is critical for driving progress in the field. Current evaluation methods are largely test-based, which involves comparing the execution results of a generated SQL query and a human-labeled ground-truth on a static test database. Such an evaluation is optimistic, as two queries can coincidentally produce the same output on the test database while actually being different. In this work, we propose a new alternative evaluation pipeline, called SpotIt, where a formal bounded equivalence verification engine actively searches for a database that differentiates the generated and ground-truth SQL queries. We develop techniques to extend existing verifiers to support a richer SQL subset relevant to Text-to-SQL. A performance evaluation of ten Text-to-SQL methods on the high-profile BIRD dataset suggests that test-based methods can often overlook differences between the generated query and the ground-truth. Further analysis of the verification results reveals a more complex picture of the current Text-to-SQL evaluation.</description>

      <title>Accurate Target Privacy Preserving Federated Learning Balancing Fairness and Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF}) that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness. Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 % discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at https://github.com/szpsunkk/FedPF.</description>

      <title>CAS-Spec: Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding for On-the-Fly Lossless Inference Acceleration of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models (LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods. We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.</description>

      <title>Broken-Token: Filtering Obfuscated Prompts by Counting Characters-Per-Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreak attacks where malicious prompts are disguised using ciphers and character-level encodings to bypass safety guardrails. While these guardrails often fail to interpret the encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text, such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.</description>

      <title>Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers, scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.</description>

      <title>BI-DCGAN: A Theoretically Grounded Bayesian Framework for Efficient and Diverse GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency. BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs, while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models remain too resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Grokipedia and Wikipedia? A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26899v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 1,800 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia, drawn from the 2,000 most-edited Wikipedia pages. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and greater structural variability. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Robot Collaboration in Unstructured Environments with Grounded Generative Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps -- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However, current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.

      <title>Scale-Aware Curriculum Learning for Ddata-Efficient Lung Nodule Detection with YOLOv11</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis, yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning (SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1) adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and 2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited annotation resources.</description>

      <title>RepV: Safety-Separable Latent Spaces for Scalable Neurosymbolic Plan Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space. This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification.

      <title>Mind the Gaps: Auditing and Reducing Group Inequity in Large-Scale Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data applications.</description>

      <title>LLM-based Multi-class Attack Analysis and Mitigation Framework in IoT/IIoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things has expanded rapidly, transforming communication and operations across industries but also increasing the attack surface and security breaches. Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in securing IoT, enabling attack detection, attack behavior analysis, and mitigation suggestion. Despite advancements, evaluations remain purely qualitative, and the lack of a standardized, objective benchmark for quantitatively measuring AI-based attack analysis and mitigation hinders consistent assessment of model effectiveness. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework combining Machine Learning (ML) for multi-class attack detection with Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack behavior analysis and mitigation suggestion. After benchmarking several ML and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers on the Edge-IIoTset and CICIoT2023 datasets, we applied structured role-play prompt engineering with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to guide ChatGPT-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 in producing detailed, context-aware responses. We introduce novel evaluation metrics for quantitative assessment to guide us and an ensemble of judge LLMs, namely ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta Llama 4, TII Falcon H1 34B Instruct, xAI Grok 3, and Claude 4 Sonnet, to independently evaluate the responses. Results show that Random Forest has the best detection model, and ChatGPT-o3 outperformed DeepSeek-R1 in attack analysis and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Can machines think efficiently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources. Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial intelligence against its total resource cost.</description>

      <title>Using Salient Object Detection to Identify Manipulative Cookie Banners that Circumvent GDPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study how often cookie banners that comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contain aesthetic manipulation, a design tactic to draw users' attention to the button that permits personal data sharing. As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent, and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.</description>

      <title>Frame Semantic Patterns for Identifying Underreporting of Notifiable Events in Healthcare: The Case of Gender-Based Violence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a methodology for the identification of notifiable events in the domain of healthcare. The methodology harnesses semantic frames to define fine-grained patterns and search them in unstructured data, namely, open-text fields in e-medical records. We apply the methodology to the problem of underreporting of gender-based violence (GBV) in e-medical records produced during patients' visits to primary care units. A total of eight patterns are defined and searched on a corpus of 21 million sentences in Brazilian Portuguese extracted from e-SUS APS. The results are manually evaluated by linguists and the precision of each pattern measured. Our findings reveal that the methodology effectively identifies reports of violence with a precision of 0.726, confirming its robustness. Designed as a transparent, efficient, low-carbon, and language-agnostic pipeline, the approach can be easily adapted to other health surveillance contexts, contributing to the broader, ethical, and explainable use of NLP in public health systems.</description>

Abstract: Clinical documentation increasingly uses automatic speech recognition and summarization, yet converting conversations into actionable medical orders for Electronic Health Records remains unexplored. A solution to this problem can significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we describe the MEDIQA-OE task, dataset, final leaderboard ranking, and participants' solutions.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Iterative Adversarial Attacks with Limited Computation Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost. Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable performance with only 30% of the original budget.</description>

      <title>LLMs are Overconfident: Evaluating Confidence Interval Calibration with FermiEval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at numerical estimation but struggle to correctly quantify uncertainty. We study how well LLMs construct confidence intervals around their own answers and find that they are systematically overconfident. To evaluate this behavior, we introduce FermiEval, a benchmark of Fermi-style estimation questions with a rigorous scoring rule for confidence interval coverage and sharpness. Across several modern models, nominal 99\% intervals cover the true answer only 65\% of the time on average. With a conformal prediction based approach that adjusts the intervals, we obtain accurate 99\% observed coverage, and the Winkler interval score decreases by 54\%. We also propose direct log-probability elicitation and quantile adjustment methods, which further reduce overconfidence at high confidence levels. Finally, we develop a perception-tunnel theory explaining why LLMs exhibit overconfidence: when reasoning under uncertainty, they act as if sampling from a truncated region of their inferred distribution, neglecting its tails.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AIoT-Based Smart Education System integrates Artificial Intelligence and IoT to address persistent challenges in contemporary classrooms: attendance fraud, lack of personalization, student disengagement, and inefficient resource use. The unified platform combines four core modules: (1) a dual-factor authentication system leveraging RFID-based ID scans and WiFi verification for secure, fraud-resistant attendance; (2) an AI-powered assistant that provides real-time, context-aware support and dynamic quiz generation based on instructor-supplied materials; (3) automated test generators to streamline adaptive assessment and reduce administrative overhead; and (4) the EcoSmart Campus module, which autonomously regulates classroom lighting, air quality, and temperature using IoT sensors and actuators. Simulated evaluations demonstrate the system's effectiveness in delivering robust real-time monitoring, fostering inclusive engagement, preventing fraudulent practices, and supporting operational scalability. Collectively, the AIoT-Based Smart Education System offers a secure, adaptive, and efficient learning environment, providing a scalable blueprint for future educational innovation and improved student outcomes through the synergistic application of artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Fair Evaluation of Variance-Aware Bandit Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework, implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2) insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform their classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: While world models are increasingly positioned as a pathway to overcoming data scarcity in domains such as robotics, open training infrastructure for world modeling remains nascent. We introduce Jasmine, a performant JAX-based world modeling codebase that scales from single hosts to hundreds of accelerators with minimal code changes. Jasmine achieves an order-of-magnitude faster reproduction of the CoinRun case study compared to prior open implementations, enabled by performance optimizations across data loading, training and checkpointing. The codebase guarantees fully reproducible training and supports diverse sharding configurations. By pairing Jasmine with curated large-scale datasets, we establish infrastructure for rigorous benchmarking pipelines across model families and architectural ablations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Spatial Reasoning-Based Visual Grounding in Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information, combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries. Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large pre-trained language models become increasingly critical to natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, their substantial computational and memory requirements have raised significant economic and environmental concerns. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Elastic Language Model (ELM), a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method optimized for compact language models. ELM extends existing NAS approaches by introducing a flexible search space with efficient transformer blocks and dynamic modules for dimension and head number adjustment. These innovations enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the search process, which facilitates more thorough and effective exploration of model architectures. We also introduce novel knowledge distillation losses that preserve the unique characteristics of each block, in order to improve the discrimination between architectural choices during the search process. Experiments on masked language modeling and causal language modeling tasks demonstrate that models discovered by ELM significantly outperform existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Sexism reinforces gender inequality and social exclusion by perpetuating stereotypes, bias, and discriminatory norms. Noting how online platforms enable various forms of sexism to thrive, there is a growing need for effective sexism detection and mitigation strategies. While computational approaches to sexism detection are widespread in high-resource languages, progress remains limited in low-resource languages where limited linguistic resources and cultural differences affect how sexism is expressed and perceived. This study introduces the first Hausa sexism detection dataset, developed through community engagement, qualitative coding, and data augmentation. For cultural nuances and linguistic representation, we conducted a two-stage user study (n=66) involving native speakers to explore how sexism is defined and articulated in everyday discourse. We further experiment with both traditional machine learning classifiers and pre-trained multilingual language models and evaluating the effectiveness few-shot learning in detecting sexism in Hausa. Our findings highlight challenges in capturing cultural nuance, particularly with clarification-seeking and idiomatic expressions, and reveal a tendency for many false positives in such cases.</description>

      <title>Detecting Data Contamination in LLMs via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Contamination Detection via Context (CoDeC), a practical and accurate method to detect and quantify training data contamination in large language models. CoDeC distinguishes between data memorized during training and data outside the training distribution by measuring how in-context learning affects model performance. We find that in-context examples typically boost confidence for unseen datasets but may reduce it when the dataset was part of training, due to disrupted memorization patterns. Experiments show that CoDeC produces interpretable contamination scores that clearly separate seen and unseen datasets, and reveals strong evidence of memorization in open-weight models with undisclosed training corpora. The method is simple, automated, and both model- and dataset-agnostic, making it easy to integrate with benchmark evaluations.</description>

      <title>Consistency Training Helps Stop Sycophancy and Jailbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.</description>

      <title>Towards a Measure of Algorithm Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on algorithm similarity.</description>

      <title>Adapting Large Language Models to Emerging Cybersecurity using Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Security applications are increasingly relying on large language models (LLMs) for cyber threat detection; however, their opaque reasoning often limits trust, particularly in decisions that require domain-specific cybersecurity knowledge. Because security threats evolve rapidly, LLMs must not only recall historical incidents but also adapt to emerging vulnerabilities and attack patterns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in general LLM applications, but its potential for cybersecurity remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a RAG-based framework designed to contextualize cybersecurity data and enhance LLM accuracy in knowledge retention and temporal reasoning. Using external datasets and the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model, we evaluate baseline RAG, an optimized hybrid retrieval approach, and conduct a comparative analysis across multiple performance metrics. Our findings highlight the promise of hybrid retrieval in strengthening the adaptability and reliability of LLMs for cybersecurity tasks.</description>

      <title>QiNN-QJ: A Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However, most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.</description>

      <title>Expressive Range Characterization of Open Text-to-Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio models are a type of generative model that produces audio output in response to a given textual prompt. Although level generators and the properties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability) dominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that emotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative and multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and multimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose. However, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what degree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output for a generative system to target.
  Within the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a quantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level generators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed prompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several standardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50) dataset. The resulting audio is analyzed along key acoustic dimensions (e.g., pitch, loudness, and timbre). More broadly, this paper offers a framework for ERA-based exploratory evaluation of generative audio models.</description>

      <title>AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.</description>

      <title>ZEBRA: Towards Zero-Shot Cross-Subject Generalization for Universal Brain Visual Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.</description>

      <title>Exploring Landscapes for Better Minima along Valleys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning. However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E" for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses) in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario, large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy (generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of 2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>MARIA: A Framework for Marginal Risk Assessment without Ground Truth in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before deploying an AI system to replace an existing process, it must be compared with the incumbent to ensure improvement without added risk. Traditional evaluation relies on ground truth for both systems, but this is often unavailable due to delayed or unknowable outcomes, high costs, or incomplete data, especially for long-standing systems deemed safe by convention. The more practical solution is not to compute absolute risk but the difference between systems. We therefore propose a marginal risk assessment framework, that avoids dependence on ground truth or absolute risk. It emphasizes three kinds of relative evaluation methodology, including predictability, capability and interaction dominance. By shifting focus from absolute to relative evaluation, our approach equips software teams with actionable guidance: identifying where AI enhances outcomes, where it introduces new risks, and how to adopt such systems responsibly.</description>

      <title>Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</description>

      <title>H2-Cache: A Novel Hierarchical Dual-Stage Cache for High-Performance Acceleration of Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of high-fidelity diffusion models.

      <title>Adaptive Defense against Harmful Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Bayesian Data Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i) the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii) limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining. Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/Bayesian-Data-Scheduler.</description>

      <title>FMint-SDE: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Accelerating Numerical Simulation of SDEs via Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Traditional numerical integrators often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while existing neural network-based approaches typically require training a separate model for each case. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modal foundation model for large-scale simulations of differential equations: FMint-SDE (Foundation Model based on Initialization for stochastic differential equations). Based on a decoder-only transformer with in-context learning, FMint-SDE leverages numerical and textual modalities to learn a universal error-correction scheme. It is trained using prompted sequences of coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers, enabling broad generalization across diverse systems. We evaluate our models on a suite of challenging SDE benchmarks spanning applications in molecular dynamics, mechanical systems, finance, and biology. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to classical solvers, underscoring the potential of FMint-SDE as a general-purpose simulation tool for dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples. Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper, we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy. At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Model Inversion: Efficient Inversion of Vision Transformers for Data-Free Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints. However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge transfer.

      <title>Unvalidated Trust: Cross-Stage Vulnerabilities in Large Language Model Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into automated, multi-stage pipelines, risk patterns that arise from unvalidated trust between processing stages become a practical concern. This paper presents a mechanism-centered taxonomy of 41 recurring risk patterns in commercial LLMs. The analysis shows that inputs are often interpreted non-neutrally and can trigger implementation-shaped responses or unintended state changes even without explicit commands. We argue that these behaviors constitute architectural failure modes and that string-level filtering alone is insufficient. To mitigate such cross-stage vulnerabilities, we recommend zero-trust architectural principles, including provenance enforcement, context sealing, and plan revalidation, and we introduce "Countermind" as a conceptual blueprint for implementing these defenses.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Online POMDP Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner (VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component, leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online solver.</description>

      <title>MemeArena: Automating Context-Aware Unbiased Evaluation of Harmfulness Understanding for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of memes on social media necessitates the capabilities of multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) to effectively understand multimodal harmfulness. Existing evaluation approaches predominantly focus on mLLMs' detection accuracy for binary classification tasks, which often fail to reflect the in-depth interpretive nuance of harmfulness across diverse contexts. In this paper, we propose MemeArena, an agent-based arena-style evaluation framework that provides a context-aware and unbiased assessment for mLLMs' understanding of multimodal harmfulness. Specifically, MemeArena simulates diverse interpretive contexts to formulate evaluation tasks that elicit perspective-specific analyses from mLLMs. By integrating varied viewpoints and reaching consensus among evaluators, it enables fair and unbiased comparisons of mLLMs' abilities to interpret multimodal harmfulness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces the evaluation biases of judge agents, with judgment results closely aligning with human preferences, offering valuable insights into reliable and comprehensive mLLM evaluations in multimodal harmfulness understanding. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Lbotirx/MemeArena.</description>

      <title>Feature-Function Curvature Analysis: A Geometric Framework for Explaining Differentiable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction. Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel, practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Feature Fusion for Spatial Morphology Analysis of Traditional Villages via Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83 (independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and generative logic.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Continual Self-Supervised Learning on Multi-Window Chest Computed Tomography for Domain-Shift Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging, mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship between previously learned knowledge and new information across different training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images. Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Soft Task-Aware Routing of Experts for Equivariant Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings. Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.</description>

      <title>DRAMA: Unifying Data Retrieval and Analysis for Open-Domain Analytic Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100 instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama.</description>

      <title>Vintage Code, Modern Judges: Meta-Validation in Low Data Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application modernization in legacy languages such as COBOL, PL/I, and REXX faces an acute shortage of resources, both in expert availability and in high-quality human evaluation data. While Large Language Models as a Judge (LaaJ) offer a scalable alternative to expert review, their reliability must be validated before being trusted in high-stakes workflows. Without principled validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's utility in real-world evaluation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond a Million Tokens: Benchmarking and Enhancing Long-Term Memory in LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations, accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities. From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and 2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each memory component.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Unseen Sentences from Speech-related Biosignals for Open-vocabulary Neural Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-to-speech (BTS) systems represent a groundbreaking approach to human communication by enabling the direct transformation of neural activity into linguistic expressions. While recent non-invasive BTS studies have largely focused on decoding predefined words or sentences, achieving open-vocabulary neural communication comparable to natural human interaction requires decoding unconstrained speech. Additionally, effectively integrating diverse signals derived from speech is crucial for developing personalized and adaptive neural communication and rehabilitation solutions for patients. This study investigates the potential of speech synthesis for previously unseen sentences across various speech modes by leveraging phoneme-level information extracted from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) signals, both independently and in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) signals. Furthermore, we examine the properties affecting phoneme decoding accuracy during sentence reconstruction and offer neurophysiological insights to further enhance EEG decoding for more effective neural communication solutions. Our findings underscore the feasibility of biosignal-based sentence-level speech synthesis for reconstructing unseen sentences, highlighting a significant step toward developing open-vocabulary neural communication systems adapted to diverse patient needs and conditions. Additionally, this study provides meaningful insights into the development of communication and rehabilitation solutions utilizing EEG-based decoding technologies.</description>

      <title>Not All Instances Are Equally Valuable: Towards Influence-Weighted Dataset Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets, achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work, we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy gains of up to 7.8%.</description>

Abstract: Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) underperform on low resource, non-Latin scripts due to tokenizer fragmentation and weak cross-lingual coupling. We present LLINK (Latent Language Injection for Non-English Knowledge), a compute efficient language-as-modality method that conditions an instruction-tuned decoder without changing the tokenizer or retraining the decoder. First, we align sentence embeddings from a frozen multilingual encoder to the decoder's latent embedding space at a reserved position via a lightweight contrastive projector. Second, the vector is expanded into K soft slots and trained with minimal adapters so the frozen decoder consumes the signal. LLINK substantially improves bilingual retrieval and achieves 81.3% preference over the base model and 63.6% over direct fine-tuning in LLM-judged Q&amp;A evaluations. We further find that improvements can be attributed to reduced tokenization inflation and a stronger cross lingual alignment, despite the model having residual weaknesses in numeric fidelity. Treating low resource languages as a modality offers a practical path to stronger cross-lingual alignment in lightweight LLMs.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Linear Attention</title>

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal, streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any $n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the efficiency of modern recurrent architectures.

      <title>MedCalc-Eval and MedCalc-Env: Advancing Medical Calculation Capabilities of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) enter the medical domain, most benchmarks evaluate them on question answering or descriptive reasoning, overlooking quantitative reasoning critical to clinical decision-making. Existing datasets like MedCalc-Bench cover few calculation tasks and fail to reflect real-world computational scenarios.
  We introduce MedCalc-Eval, the largest benchmark for assessing LLMs' medical calculation abilities, comprising 700+ tasks across two types: equation-based (e.g., Cockcroft-Gault, BMI, BSA) and rule-based scoring systems (e.g., Apgar, Glasgow Coma Scale). These tasks span diverse specialties including internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and cardiology, offering a broader and more challenging evaluation setting.
  To improve performance, we further develop MedCalc-Env, a reinforcement learning environment built on the InternBootcamp framework, enabling multi-step clinical reasoning and planning. Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-32B model within this environment achieves state-of-the-art results on MedCalc-Eval, with notable gains in numerical sensitivity, formula selection, and reasoning robustness. Remaining challenges include unit conversion, multi-condition logic, and contextual understanding.

      <title>Why Do Multilingual Reasoning Gaps Emerge in Reasoning Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet they still suffer from a multilingual reasoning gap, performing better in high-resource languages than in low-resource ones. While recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/deokhk/RLM_analysis.</description>

      <title>FOCUS: Efficient Keyframe Selection for Long Video Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however, inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20 minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.</description>

      <title>HiF-DTA: Hierarchical Feature Learning Network for Drug-Target Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly 3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level, substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural, and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Help You at Work? A Sandbox for Evaluating LLM Agents in Enterprise Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise systems are crucial for enhancing productivity and decision-making among employees and customers. Integrating LLM based systems into enterprise systems enables intelligent automation, personalized experiences, and efficient information retrieval, driving operational efficiency and strategic growth. However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in enterprise-focused AI systems.</description>

      <title>Un-Attributability: Computing Novelty From Retrieval &amp; Semantic Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA) methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference, we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2 and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm</description>

      <title>CASR-Net: An Image Processing-focused Deep Learning-based Coronary Artery Segmentation and Refinement Network for X-ray Coronary Angiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by 0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Visual Communication and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage, the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study, demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.</description>

      <title>Measuring Chain-of-Thought Monitorability Through Faithfulness and Verbosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning. Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks: The Future of Brain-Inspired Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent the latest generation of neural computation, offering a brain-inspired alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals, SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the 20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable training. This study concludes that SNNs, with further refinement, are poised to propel the next phase of neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Balancing Knowledge Updates: Toward Unified Modular Editing in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient approach for updating factual knowledge in large language models (LLMs). It typically locates knowledge storage modules and then modifies their parameters. However, most existing methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing. This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an optimal range across diverse settings.</description>

      <title>FedMuon: Accelerating Federated Learning with Matrix Orthogonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting, Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2) moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Atlas-Alignment: Making Interpretability Transferable Across Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and controllable at minimal marginal cost.</description>

      <title>Who Does Your Algorithm Fail? Investigating Age and Ethnic Bias in the MAMA-MIA Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.</description>

      <title>Learning Soft Robotic Dynamics with Active Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable, reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in compliant robots.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Semantic Collapse in Partially Relevant Video Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently, embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>CoMViT: An Efficient Vision Backbone for Supervised Classification in Medical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size. These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.</description>

      <title>VCORE: Variance-Controlled Optimization-based Reweighting for Chain-of-Thought Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long chain-of-thought (CoT) trajectories has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the standard cross-entropy loss treats all tokens equally, ignoring their heterogeneous contributions across a reasoning trajectory. This uniform treatment leads to misallocated supervision and weak generalization, especially in complex, long-form reasoning tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{V}ariance-\textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{O}ptimization-based \textbf{RE}weighting (VCORE), a principled framework that reformulates CoT supervision as a constrained optimization problem. By adopting an optimization-theoretic perspective, VCORE enables a principled and adaptive allocation of supervision across tokens, thereby aligning the training objective more closely with the goal of robust reasoning generalization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that VCORE consistently outperforms existing token reweighting methods. Across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, VCORE achieves substantial performance gains on mathematical and coding benchmarks, using models from the Qwen3 series (4B, 8B, 32B) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct. Moreover, we show that VCORE serves as a more effective initialization for subsequent reinforcement learning, establishing a stronger foundation for advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The Code will be released at https://github.com/coder-gx/VCORE.</description>

      <title>Thought Branches: Interpreting LLM Reasoning Requires Resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.</description>

      <title>FedAdamW: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer with Convergence and Generalization Guarantees for Federated Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2) the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first \underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW}, for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting. \texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$ without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$ is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of \texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test accuracy. The code is available in https://github.com/junkangLiu0/FedAdamW.</description>

      <title>InertialAR: Autoregressive 3D Molecule Generation with Inertial Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations, and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover, it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all 5 metrics.</description>

      <title>DP-FedPGN: Finding Global Flat Minima for Differentially Private Federated Learning via Penalizing Gradient Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2510.27508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate lung tumor segmentation is vital for improving diagnosis and treatment planning, and effectively combining anatomical and functional information from PET and CT remains a major challenge. In this study, we propose vMambaX, a lightweight multimodal framework integrating PET and CT scan images through a Context-Gated Cross-Modal Perception Module (CGM). Built on the Visual Mamba architecture, vMambaX adaptively enhances inter-modality feature interaction, emphasizing informative regions while suppressing noise. Evaluated on the PCLT20K dataset, the model outperforms baseline models while maintaining lower computational complexity. These results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive cross-modal gating for multimodal tumor segmentation and demonstrate the potential of vMambaX as an efficient and scalable framework for advanced lung cancer analysis.

      <description>arXiv:2510.27522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance, consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the broader time series literature.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2, an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights, and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these, we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3) OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.</description>

      <title>DialectalArabicMMLU: Benchmarking Dialectal Capabilities in Arabic and Multilingual Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DialectalArabicMMLU, a new benchmark for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) across Arabic dialects. While recently developed Arabic and multilingual benchmarks have advanced LLM evaluation for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectal varieties remain underrepresented despite their prevalence in everyday communication. DialectalArabicMMLU extends the MMLU-Redux framework through manual translation and adaptation of 3K multiple-choice question-answer pairs into five major dialects (Syrian, Egyptian, Emirati, Saudi, and Moroccan), yielding a total of 15K QA pairs across 32 academic and professional domains (22K QA pairs when also including English and MSA). The benchmark enables systematic assessment of LLM reasoning and comprehension beyond MSA, supporting both task-based and linguistic analysis. We evaluate 19 open-weight Arabic and multilingual LLMs (1B-13B parameters) and report substantial performance variation across dialects, revealing persistent gaps in dialectal generalization. DialectalArabicMMLU provides the first unified, human-curated resource for measuring dialectal understanding in Arabic, thus promoting more inclusive evaluation and future model development.</description>

      <title>EBT-Policy: Energy Unlocks Emergent Physical Reasoning Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's 100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation, EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior under distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Sybil-Resistant Service Discovery for Agent Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.</description>

      <title>Toward Accurate Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation: Language-to-Action with Foundation Models via Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework that leverages pre-trained foundation models for robotic manipulation without domain-specific training. The framework integrates off-the-shelf models, combining multimodal perception from foundation models with a general-purpose reasoning model capable of robust task sequencing. Scene graphs, dynamically maintained within the framework, provide spatial awareness and enable consistent reasoning about the environment. The framework is evaluated through a series of tabletop robotic manipulation experiments, and the results highlight its potential for building robotic manipulation systems directly on top of off-the-shelf foundation models.</description>

      <title>CodeAlignBench: Assessing Code Generation Models on Developer-Preferred Code Adjustments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code, evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings: adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and limitations across languages and generation goals.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Video Retrieval: Generalizing Video Embedding via Synthesized Multimodal Pyramid Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.</description>

      <title>Spatial-SSRL: Enhancing Spatial Understanding via Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision, specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure: shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting, regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Biorisk Evaluations on Open-Weight Bio-Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27629v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \eval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \eval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.</description>

      <title>Sketch-to-Layout: Sketch-Guided Multimodal Layout Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored. To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet, DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k) synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.</description>

      <title>VessShape: Few-shot 2D blood vessel segmentation by leveraging shape priors from synthetic images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures, encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains, requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Greedy Layer-wise Training for Traffic Sign Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.</description>

Abstract: Feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) explain individual predictions but often miss higher-order structure: sets of features that act in concert. We propose Modules of Influence (MoI), a framework that (i) constructs a model explanation graph from per-instance attributions, (ii) applies community detection to find feature modules that jointly affect predictions, and (iii) quantifies how these modules relate to bias, redundancy, and causality patterns. Across synthetic and real datasets, MoI uncovers correlated feature groups, improves model debugging via module-level ablations, and localizes bias exposure to specific modules. We release stability and synergy metrics, a reference implementation, and evaluation protocols to benchmark module discovery in XAI.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data, small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset, we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET, CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.</description>

      <title>Continuous Autoregressive Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code: https://github.com/shaochenze/calm.

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Process-Oriented Automatic Text Summarization with Exploration of LLM-Based Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, aims to create concise and accurate summaries, thereby significantly reducing the human effort required in processing large volumes of text. ATS has drawn considerable interest in both academic and industrial circles. Many studies have been conducted in the past to survey ATS methods; however, they generally lack practicality for real-world implementations, as they often categorize previous methods from a theoretical standpoint. Moreover, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has altered conventional ATS methods. In this survey, we aim to 1) provide a comprehensive overview of ATS from a ``Process-Oriented Schema'' perspective, which is best aligned with real-world implementations; 2) comprehensively review the latest LLM-based ATS works; and 3) deliver an up-to-date survey of ATS, bridging the two-year gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to specifically investigate LLM-based ATS methods.</description>

      <title>VRoPE: Rotary Position Embedding for Video Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has shown strong performance in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), but extending it to video remains a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal structure of video frames. Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Additionally, our approach restructures positional indices to ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Extensive experiments on different models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/johncaged/VRoPE.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning via Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency and verifiability of decision-making. Achieving semantic interpretability in reinforcement learning requires (1) a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts and (2) a policy that is interpretable and verifiable. However, constructing such a feature space has traditionally relied on manual human specification, which often fails to generalize to unseen environments. Moreover, even when interpretable features are available, most reinforcement learning algorithms employ black-box models as policies, thereby hindering transparency. We introduce interpretable Tree-based Reinforcement learning via Automated Concept Extraction (iTRACE), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and train a interpretable tree-based model via RL. To address the impracticality of running VLMs in RL loops, we distill their outputs into a lightweight model. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate tree-based reinforcement learning, iTRACE loosens the reliance the need for human annotation that is traditionally required by interpretable models. In addition, it addresses key limitations of VLMs alone, such as their lack of grounding in action spaces and their inability to directly optimize policies. We evaluate iTRACE across three domains: Atari games, grid-world navigation, and driving. The results show that iTRACE outperforms other interpretable policy baselines and matches the performance of black-box policies on the same interpretable feature space.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Objective-Driven Dynamical Stochastic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fields offer a versatile approach for describing complex systems composed of interacting and dynamic components. In particular, some of these dynamical and stochastic systems may exhibit goal-directed behaviors aimed at achieving specific objectives, which we refer to as $\textit{intelligent fields}$. However, due to their inherent complexity, it remains challenging to develop a formal theoretical description of such systems and to effectively translate these descriptions into practical applications. In this paper, we propose three fundamental principles to establish a theoretical framework for understanding intelligent fields: complete configuration, locality, and purposefulness. Moreover, we explore methodologies for designing such fields from the perspective of artificial intelligence applications. This initial investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future theoretical developments and practical advances in understanding and harnessing the potential of such objective-driven dynamical stochastic fields.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning vs. Distillation: Understanding Accuracy and Capability in LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) enhances overall accuracy (pass@1) but often fails to improve capability (pass@k) of LLMs in reasoning tasks, while distillation can improve both. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR struggles to improve capability as it focuses on improving the accuracy of the easier questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions. Second, we show that RLVR does not merely increase the success probability for the easier questions, but in our small model settings, produces quality responses that were absent in its original output distribution. In addition, we show these responses are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords, underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third, from the experiment distilling teacher responses to in-distribution problems, we find that capability does not always improve with distillation. We conjecture that capability improves only when new knowledge is introduced, whereas distilling reasoning patterns only improves accuracy but not capability, sacrificing performance on the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape reasoning behavior in LLMs</description>

      <title>Building Trustworthy AI by Addressing its 16+2 Desiderata with Goal-Directed Commonsense Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current advances in AI and its applicability have highlighted the need to ensure its trustworthiness for legal, ethical, and even commercial reasons. Sub-symbolic machine learning algorithms, such as the LLMs, simulate reasoning but hallucinate and their decisions cannot be explained or audited (crucial aspects for trustworthiness). On the other hand, rule-based reasoners, such as Cyc, are able to provide the chain of reasoning steps but are complex and use a large number of reasoners. We propose a middle ground using s(CASP), a goal-directed constraint-based answer set programming reasoner that employs a small number of mechanisms to emulate reliable and explainable human-style commonsense reasoning. In this paper, we explain how s(CASP) supports the 16 desiderata for trustworthy AI introduced by Doug Lenat and Gary Marcus (2023), and two additional ones: inconsistency detection and the assumption of alternative worlds. To illustrate the feasibility and synergies of s(CASP), we present a range of diverse applications, including a conversational chatbot and a virtually embodied reasoner.</description>

      <title>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater: How and why deep learning for ARC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) presents a formidable challenge for AI systems. Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%). Our findings highlight the key ingredients of a robust reasoning system in unfamiliar domains, underscoring the central mechanisms that improve broad perceptual reasoning.</description>

      <title>NaviAgent: Bilevel Planning on Tool Navigation Graph for Large-Scale Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to act as function call agents by invoking external tools, enabling them to solve tasks beyond their static knowledge. However, existing agents typically call tools step by step at a time without a global view of task structure. As tools depend on each other, this leads to error accumulation and limited scalability, particularly when scaling to thousands of tools. To address these limitations, we propose NaviAgent, a novel bilevel architecture that decouples task planning from tool execution through graph-based modeling of the tool ecosystem. At the task-planning level, the LLM-based agent decides whether to respond directly, clarify user intent, invoke a toolchain, or execute tool outputs, ensuring broad coverage of interaction scenarios independent of inter-tool complexity. At the execution level, a continuously evolving Tool World Navigation Model (TWNM) encodes structural and behavioral relations among tools, guiding the agent to generate scalable and robust invocation sequences. By incorporating feedback from real tool interactions, NaviAgent supports closed-loop optimization of planning and execution, moving beyond tool calling toward adaptive navigation of large-scale tool ecosystems. Experiments show that NaviAgent achieves the best task success rates across models and tasks, and integrating TWMN further boosts performance by up to 17 points on complex tasks, underscoring its key role in toolchain orchestration.</description>

      <title>HiRA: A Hierarchical Reasoning Framework for Decoupled Planning and Execution in Deep Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage specialized expertise for different types of information processing. Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2507.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments. To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further propose a set of six recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.</description>

      <title>Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cognitive Convergence via Implementation: A Structured Loop Reflecting Four Theories of Mind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a structural convergence among four influential theories of mind: Kahneman's dual-system theory, Friston's predictive processing, Minsky's society of mind, and Clark's extended mind, emerging unintentionally within a practical AI architecture known as Agentic Flow. Designed to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interlocking modules: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action, organized into a repeatable cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, subsequent analysis revealed that its structure echoes computational motifs from all four theories, suggesting that theoretical convergence can emerge naturally from implementation demands rather than deliberate synthesis. Controlled evaluations confirmed this: the structured agent achieved 95.8% task success versus 62.3% for baseline LLMs, demonstrating robust constraint adherence and reproducible reasoning. We describe this convergence under a broader descriptive meta-architecture called PEACE, highlighting recurring design patterns such as predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control. Later formalized as the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), this framework generalizes the same principles as a foundation for behavioral intelligence in LLM-based agents. Rather than claiming theoretical unification, this paper proposes that intelligent architectures may evolve toward shared structural patterns shaped by practical constraints. As a position paper, it aims to frame this convergence as an interpretive reflection rather than a finalized theory, inviting further theoretical and experimental dialogue. Agentic Flow, or equivalently the Structured Cognitive Loop, thus offers a glimpse of how a unified cognitive form can arise not from abstraction, but from the necessities of real-world reasoning.</description>

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation - referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML, impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables reliable implementation with web agents to date. We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) - within the same input token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations - one token order above, but within the model's context window - outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover, yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Artificially intelligent agents in the social and behavioral sciences: A history and outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the historical development and current trends of artificially intelligent agents (agentic AI) in the social and behavioral sciences: from the first programmable computers, and social simulations soon thereafter, to today's experiments with large language models. This overview emphasizes the role of AI in the scientific process and the changes brought about, both through technological advancements and the broader evolution of science from around 1950 to the present. Some of the specific points we cover include: the challenges of presenting the first social simulation studies to a world unaware of computers, the rise of social systems science, intelligent game theoretic agents, the age of big data and the epistemic upheaval in its wake, and the current enthusiasm around applications of generative AI, and many other topics. A pervasive theme is how deeply entwined we are with the technologies we use to understand ourselves.</description>

      <title>BuildArena: A Physics-Aligned Interactive Benchmark of LLMs for Engineering Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

      <title>RELATE: A Schema-Agnostic Perceiver Encoder for Multimodal Relational Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce, healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark, where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way toward foundation models for relational graph data.</description>

      <title>Towards the Formalization of a Trustworthy AI for Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust, accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</description>

      <title>A Survey of AI Scientists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing a profound transition from a computational instrument to an autonomous originator of scientific knowledge. This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape, obscuring overarching methodological principles and developmental trends. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of this domain by introducing a unified, six-stage methodological framework that deconstructs the end-to-end scientific process into: Literature Review, Idea Generation, Experimental Preparation, Experimental Execution, Scientific Writing, and Paper Generation. Through this analytical lens, we chart the field's evolution from early Foundational Modules (2022-2023) to integrated Closed-Loop Systems (2024), and finally to the current frontier of Scalability, Impact, and Human-AI Collaboration (2025-present). By rigorously synthesizing these developments, this survey not only clarifies the current state of autonomous science but also provides a critical roadmap for overcoming remaining challenges in robustness and governance, ultimately guiding the next generation of systems toward becoming trustworthy and indispensable partners in human scientific inquiry.</description>

      <title>Normative Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Comparative Benchmark from Logical and Modal Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

      <title>Understanding the Application of Utility Theory in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents typically assumes a \textit{train-once-deploy-once} strategy, which is unrealistic as deployed agents continually encounter novel environments. To address this, we propose the Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, where agents learn and adapt incrementally across multiple \textit{scene domains}. CVLN includes two setups: Initial-instruction based CVLN for instruction-following, and Dialogue-based CVLN for dialogue-guided navigation. We also introduce two simple yet effective baselines for sequential decision-making: Perplexity Replay (PerpR), which replays difficult episodes, and Episodic Self-Replay (ESR), which stores and revisits action logits during training. Experiments show that existing continual learning methods fall short for CVLN, while PerpR and ESR achieve better performance by efficiently utilizing replay memory.</description>

      <title>MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.</description>

      <title>RepoMasterEval: Evaluating Code Completion via Real-World Repositories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks has become critical. Existing benchmarks focus more on code completion in function and class level by providing text descriptions to prompt the model. By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block. These limitations makes existing evaluation benchmarks poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools. In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world repositories. Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites. To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score. Our empirical evaluation on 10 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report variance in model performance in real-world scenarios. The deployment of RepoMasterEval also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.</description>

      <title>Towards User-Focused Research in Training Data Attribution for Human-Centered Explainable AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI systems more transparent, yet many practices emphasise mathematical rigour over practical user needs. We propose an alternative to this model-centric approach by following a design thinking process for the emerging XAI field of training data attribution (TDA), which risks repeating solutionist patterns seen in other subfields. However, because TDA is in its early stages, there is a valuable opportunity to shape its direction through user-centred practices. We engage directly with machine learning developers via a needfinding interview study (N=6) and a scenario-based interactive user study (N=31) to ground explanations in real workflows. Our exploration of the TDA design space reveals novel tasks for data-centric explanations useful to developers, such as grouping training samples behind specific model behaviours or identifying undersampled data. We invite the TDA, XAI, and HCI communities to engage with these tasks to strengthen their research's practical relevance and human impact.</description>

      <title>SparsePO: Controlling Preference Alignment of LLMs via Sparse Token Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms have proven an effective step for aligning language models to human-desired behaviors. Current variants of the Direct Preference Optimization objective have focused on a strict setting where all tokens are contributing signals of KL divergence and rewards to the loss function. However, human preference is not affected equally by each word in a sequence but is often dependent on specific words or phrases, e.g. existence of toxic terms leads to non-preferred responses. Based on this observation, we argue that not all tokens should be weighted equally during PO and propose a flexible objective termed SparsePO, that aims to automatically learn to weight the KL divergence and reward corresponding to each token during PO training. We propose two different variants of weight-masks that can either be derived from the reference model itself or learned on the fly. Notably, our method induces sparsity in the learned masks, allowing the model to learn how to best balance reward and KL divergence contributions at the token level, learning an optimal level of mask sparsity. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our approach at aligning to preference proxies, including sentiment control, helpfulness and harmlessness, and summary quality. Our method obtains +10% and +3% win rate points in summarization and dialogue scenarios, respectively, without compromising model reasoning or the relevancy and faithfulness of the summary response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture, at once, dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of this systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and 366 papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive review of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in their studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and broadest systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of results from current spatio-temporal GNN models applied to different domains. In its final part, this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability. This paper is complemented by a GitHub repository at https://github.com/FlaGer99/SLR-Spatio-Temporal-GNN.git providing additional interactive tools to further explore the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Representative Social Choice: From Learning Theory to AI Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social choice theory is the study of preference aggregation across a population, used both in mechanism design for human agents and in the democratic alignment of language models. In this study, we propose the representative social choice framework for the modeling of democratic representation in collective decisions, where the number of issues and individuals are too large for mechanisms to consider all preferences directly. These scenarios are widespread in real-world decision-making processes, such as jury trials, legislation, corporate governance, and, more recently, language model alignment. In representative social choice, the population is represented by a finite sample of individual-issue pairs based on which social choice decisions are made. We show that many of the deepest questions in representative social choice can be formulated as statistical learning problems, and prove the generalization properties of social choice mechanisms using the theory of machine learning. We further formulate axioms for representative social choice, and prove Arrow-like impossibility theorems with new combinatorial tools of analysis. Our framework introduces the representative approach to social choice, opening up research directions at the intersection of social choice, learning theory, and AI alignment.</description>

      <title>LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) architectures have become a cornerstone for scaling up and are a key component in most large language models such as GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-4, and Gemini-2.5. However, systematic research on MoE remains severely constrained by the prohibitive computational costs of training and evaluation, restricting large-scale studies accessible to most researchers. We introduce LibMoE, a unified framework for reproducible, efficient, and extensible MoE research that supports both pretraining and sparse-upcycling regimes. Beyond unified implementations, the framework provides transparent analytical tools for probing routing and expert dynamics. Leveraging this foundation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis along three dimensions: (i) routing dynamics, covering expert selection patterns, routing stability and optimality, and how routing entropy reveals task specialization and expert diversity; (ii) the effect of lightweight initialization on load balancing, demonstrating how subtle changes in router initialization shape early expert utilization; and (iii) training regime differences, revealing how sparse upcycling and full pretraining exhibit distinct routing patterns and stability profiles. By lowering the barrier to entry and standardizing evaluation, along with our comprehensive analysis, LibMoE broadens access to MoE research and establishes a reliable benchmark to guide future innovations.

      <title>Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Linearly Structured f-Divergence Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Robust Regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) is proposed to learn policies robust to dynamics shifts by adding regularization to the transition dynamics in the value function. Existing methods mostly use unstructured regularization, potentially leading to conservative policies under unrealistic transitions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, the $d$-rectangular linear RRMDP ($d$-RRMDP), which introduces latent structures into both transition kernels and regularization. We focus on offline reinforcement learning, where an agent learns policies from a precollected dataset in the nominal environment. We develop the Robust Regularized Pessimistic Value Iteration (R2PVI) algorithm that employs linear function approximation for robust policy learning in $d$-RRMDPs with $f$-divergence based regularization terms on transition kernels. We provide instance-dependent upper bounds on the suboptimality gap of R2PVI policies, demonstrating that these bounds are influenced by how well the dataset covers state-action spaces visited by the optimal robust policy under robustly admissible transitions. We establish information-theoretic lower bounds to verify that our algorithm is near-optimal. Finally, numerical experiments validate that R2PVI learns robust policies and exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs' safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap, we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments, covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety awareness. Dataset and codes are available in https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench and https://huggingface.co/datasets/safeagentbench/SafeAgentBench.</description>

      <title>Bias in Decision-Making for AI's Ethical Dilemmas: A Comparative Study of ChatGPT and Claude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10484v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study systematically evaluates how nine popular LLMs (both open-source and closed-source) respond to ethical dilemmas involving protected attributes. Across 50,400 trials spanning single and intersectional attribute combinations in four dilemma scenarios (protective vs. harmful), we assess models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering patterns. Results reveal significant biases in protected attributes in all models, with differing preferences depending on model type and dilemma context. Notably, open-source LLMs show stronger preferences for marginalized groups and greater sensitivity in harmful scenarios, while closed-source models are more selective in protective situations and tend to favor mainstream groups. We also find that ethical behavior varies across dilemma types: LLMs maintain consistent patterns in protective scenarios but respond with more diverse and cognitively demanding decisions in harmful ones. Furthermore, models display more pronounced ethical tendencies under intersectional conditions than in single-attribute settings, suggesting that complex inputs reveal deeper biases. These findings highlight the need for multi-dimensional, context-aware evaluation of LLMs' ethical behavior and offer a systematic evaluation and approach to understanding and addressing fairness in LLM decision-making.</description>

      <title>Multilingual State Space Models for Structured Question Answering in Indic Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity and complexity of Indic languages present unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in the domain of question answering (QA).To address these challenges, this paper explores the application of State Space Models (SSMs),to build efficient and contextually aware QA systems tailored for Indic languages. SSMs are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to model long-term and short-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-equipped to handle the rich morphology, complex syntax, and contextual intricacies characteristic of Indian languages. We evaluated multiple SSM architectures across diverse datasets representing various Indic languages and conducted a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that these models effectively capture linguistic subtleties, leading to significant improvements in question interpretation, context alignment, and answer generation. This work represents the first application of SSMs to question answering tasks in Indic languages, establishing a foundational benchmark for future research in this domain. We propose enhancements to existing SSM frameworks, optimizing their applicability to low-resource settings and multilingual scenarios prevalent in Indic languages.</description>

      <title>On-device Computation of Single-lead ECG Parameters for Real-time Remote Cardiac Health Assessment: A Real-world Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, continuous out-of-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) parameter measurement is vital for real-time cardiac health monitoring and telemedicine. On-device computation of single-lead ECG parameters enables timely assessment without reliance on centralized data processing, advancing personalized, ubiquitous cardiac care-yet comprehensive validation across heterogeneous real-world populations remains limited. This study validated the on-device algorithm FeatureDB (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/FeatureDB) using two datasets: HeartVoice-ECG-lite (369 participants with single-lead ECGs annotated by two physicians) and PTB-XL/PTB-XL+ (21,354 patients with 12-lead ECGs and physicians' diagnostic annotations). FeatureDB computed PR, QT, and QTc intervals, with accuracy evaluated against physician annotations via mean absolute error (MAE), correlation analysis, and Bland-Altman analysis. Diagnostic performance for first-degree atrioventricular block (AVBI, PR-based) and long QT syndrome (LQT, QTc-based) was benchmarked against commercial 12-lead systems (12SL, Uni-G) and open-source algorithm Deli, using AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results showed high concordance with expert annotations (Pearson correlations: 0.836-0.960), MAEs matching inter-observer variability, and minimal bias. AVBI AUC reached 0.787 (12SL: 0.859; Uni-G: 0.812; Deli: 0.501); LQT AUC was 0.684 (12SL: 0.716; Uni-G: 0.605; Deli: 0.569)-comparable to commercial tools and superior to open-source alternatives. FeatureDB delivers physician-level parameter accuracy and commercial-grade abnormality detection via single-lead devices, supporting scalable telemedicine, decentralized cardiac screening, and continuous monitoring in community and outpatient settings.</description>

      <title>Training a Generally Curious Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient exploration is essential for intelligent systems interacting with their environment, but existing language models often fall short in scenarios that require strategic information gathering. In this paper, we present Paprika, a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general decision-making capabilities that are not confined to particular environments. By training on synthetic interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, Paprika teaches models to explore and adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with Paprika can effectively transfer their learned decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, our approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. To improve sample efficiency, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories from tasks with high learning potential. These results suggest a promising path towards AI systems that can autonomously solve novel sequential decision-making problems that require interactions with the external world.</description>

      <title>Scalable Best-of-N Selection for Large Language Models via Self-Certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Best-of-N selection is a key technique for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through increased test-time computation. Current state-of-the-art methods often employ computationally intensive reward models for response evaluation and selection. Reward-free alternatives, like self-consistency and universal self-consistency, are limited in their ability to handle open-ended generation tasks or scale effectively. To address these limitations, we propose self-certainty, a novel and efficient metric that leverages the inherent probability distribution of LLM outputs to estimate response quality without requiring external reward models. We hypothesize that higher distributional self-certainty, aggregated across multiple samples, correlates with improved response accuracy, as it reflects greater confidence in the generated output. Through extensive experiments on various reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that self-certainty (1) scales effectively with increasing sample size N, akin to reward models but without the computational overhead; (2) complements chain-of-thought, improving reasoning performance beyond greedy decoding; and (3) generalizes to open-ended tasks where traditional self-consistency methods fall short. Our findings establish self-certainty as a practical and efficient way for improving LLM reasoning capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/backprop07/Self-Certainty</description>

      <title>Fast Adversarial Training against Sparse Attacks Requires Loss Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies fast adversarial training against sparse adversarial perturbations bounded by $l_0$ norm. We demonstrate the challenges of employing $1$-step attacks on $l_0$ bounded perturbations for fast adversarial training, including degraded performance and the occurrence of catastrophic overfitting (CO). We highlight that CO in $l_0$ adversarial training is caused by sub-optimal perturbation locations of $1$-step attack. Theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that the loss landscape of $l_0$ adversarial training is more craggy compared to its $l_\infty$, $l_2$ and $l_1$ counterparts. Moreover, we corroborate that the craggy loss landscape can aggravate CO. To address these issues, we propose Fast-LS-$l_0$ that incorporates soft labels and the trade-off loss function to smooth the adversarial loss landscape. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method can overcome the challenge of catastrophic overfitting, achieve state-of-the-art performance, and narrow down the performance gap between $1$-step and multi-step adversarial training against sparse attacks.</description>

      <title>More of the Same: Persistent Representational Harms Under Increased Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To recognize and mitigate the harms of generative AI systems, it is crucial to consider whether and how different societal groups are represented by these systems. A critical gap emerges when naively measuring or improving who is represented, as this does not consider how people are represented. In this work, we develop GAS(P), an evaluation methodology for surfacing distribution-level group representational biases in generated text, tackling the setting where groups are unprompted (i.e., groups are not specified in the input to generative systems). We apply this novel methodology to investigate gendered representations in occupations across state-of-the-art large language models. We show that, even though the gender distribution when models are prompted to generate biographies leads to a large representation of women, even representational biases persist in how different genders are represented. Our evaluation methodology reveals that there are statistically significant distribution-level differences in the word choice used to describe biographies and personas of different genders across occupations, and we show that many of these differences are associated with representational harms and stereotypes. Our empirical findings caution that naively increasing (unprompted) representation may inadvertently proliferate representational biases, and our proposed evaluation methodology enables systematic and rigorous measurement of the problem.</description>

      <title>(How) Do Language Models Track State?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that seem to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do this? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, and then refines this with an associative scan. LMs that learn the former algorithm tend to generalize better and converge faster, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pre-trained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state-tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</description>

      <title>Modelling Emotions in Face-to-Face Setting: The Interplay of Eye-Tracking, Personality, and Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate emotion recognition is pivotal for nuanced and engaging human-computer interactions, yet remains difficult to achieve, especially in dynamic, conversation-like settings. In this study, we showcase how integrating eye-tracking data, temporal dynamics, and personality traits can substantially enhance the detection of both perceived and felt emotions. Seventy-three participants viewed short, speech-containing videos from the CREMA-D dataset, while being recorded for eye-tracking signals (pupil size, fixation patterns), Big Five personality assessments, and self-reported emotional states. Our neural network models combined these diverse inputs including stimulus emotion labels for contextual cues and yielded marked performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, perceived valence predictions reached a macro F1-score of 0.76, and models incorporating personality traits and stimulus information demonstrated significant improvements in felt emotion accuracy. These results highlight the benefit of unifying physiological, individual and contextual factors to address the subjectivity and complexity of emotional expression. Beyond validating the role of user-specific data in capturing subtle internal states, our findings inform the design of future affective computing and human-agent systems, paving the way for more adaptive and cross-individual emotional intelligence in real-world interactions.</description>

Abstract: Digital image spoofing has emerged as a significant security threat in biometric authentication systems, particularly those relying on facial recognition. This study evaluates the performance of three vision based models, MobileNetV2, ResNET50, and Vision Transformer, ViT, for spoof detection in image classification, utilizing a dataset of 150,986 images divided into training , 140,002, testing, 10,984, and validation ,39,574, sets. Spoof detection is critical for enhancing the security of image recognition systems, and this research compares the models effectiveness through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Results reveal that MobileNetV2 outperforms other architectures on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.59%, precision of 91.72%, recall of 91.59%, and F1 score of 91.58%, compared to ViT 86.54%, 88.28%, 86.54%, and 86.39%, respectively. On the validation dataset, MobileNetV2, and ViT excel, with MobileNetV2 slightly ahead at 97.17% accuracy versus ViT 96.36%. MobileNetV2 demonstrates faster convergence during training and superior generalization to unseen data, despite both models showing signs of overfitting. These findings highlight MobileNetV2 balanced performance and robustness, making it the preferred choice for spoof detection applications where reliability on new data is essential. The study underscores the importance of model selection in security sensitive contexts and suggests MobileNetV2 as a practical solution for real world deployment.</description>

      <title>On the Mistaken Assumption of Interchangeable Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a paradigm of artificial intelligence where an agent uses a neural network to learn which actions to take in a given environment. DRL has recently gained traction from being able to solve complex environments like driving simulators, 3D robotic control, and multiplayer-online-battle-arena video games. Numerous implementations of the state-of-the-art algorithms responsible for training these agents, like the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms, currently exist. However, studies make the mistake of assuming implementations of the same algorithm to be consistent and thus, interchangeable. In this paper, through a differential testing lens, we present the results of studying the extent of implementation inconsistencies, their effect on the implementations' performance, as well as their impact on the conclusions of prior studies under the assumption of interchangeable implementations. The outcomes of our differential tests showed significant discrepancies between the tested algorithm implementations, indicating that they are not interchangeable. In particular, out of the five PPO implementations tested on 56 games, three implementations achieved superhuman performance for 50% of their total trials while the other two implementations only achieved superhuman performance for less than 15% of their total trials. As part of a meticulous manual analysis of the implementations' source code, we analyzed implementation discrepancies and determined that code-level inconsistencies primarily caused these discrepancies. Lastly, we replicated a study and showed that this assumption of implementation interchangeability was sufficient to flip experiment outcomes. Therefore, this calls for a shift in how implementations are being used.</description>

      <title>GenSwarm: Scalable Multi-Robot Code-Policy Generation and Deployment via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally follows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to adapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures, GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.</description>

      <title>RaanA: A Fast, Flexible, and Data-Efficient Post-Training Quantization Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training Quantization (PTQ) has become a widely used technique for improving inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, existing PTQ methods generally suffer from crucial limitations such as heavy calibration data requirements and inflexible choice of target number of bits. In this paper, we propose RaanA, a unified PTQ framework that overcomes these challenges by introducing two novel components: 1) RaBitQ-H, a variant of a randomized vector quantization method RaBitQ, designed for fast, accurate, and highly efficient quantization; and 2) AllocateBits, an algorithm that optimally allocates bit-widths across layers based on their quantization sensitivity. RaanA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art quantization methods while being extremely fast, requiring minimal calibration data, and enabling flexible bit allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RaanA's efficacy in balancing efficiency and accuracy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/RaanA .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing machine unlearning (MU) approaches exhibit significant sensitivity to hyperparameters, requiring meticulous tuning that limits practical deployment. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the instability and suboptimal performance of existing popular MU methods when deployed in different scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Dual Optimizer (DualOptim), which incorporates adaptive learning rate and decoupled momentum factors. Empirical and theoretical evidence demonstrates that DualOptim contributes to effective and stable unlearning. Through extensive experiments, we show that DualOptim can significantly boost MU efficacy and stability across diverse tasks, including image classification, image generation, and large language models, making it a versatile approach to empower existing MU algorithms.</description>

      <title>AVA: Towards Agentic Video Analytics with Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00254v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly important across diverse domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava. The AVA-100 benchmark can be accessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/iesc/Ava-100.</description>

      <title>Data Therapist: Eliciting Domain Knowledge from Subject Matter Experts Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. Motivated by growing demands to surface tacit knowledge, we present the Data Therapist, a web-based system that helps domain experts externalize such implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&amp;A with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system automatically analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and supports annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. A qualitative study with expert pairs from Accounting, Political Science, and Computer Security revealed recurring patterns in how expert reason about their data and highlighted opportunities for AI support to enhance visualization design.</description>

      <title>Fair Play for Individuals, Foul Play for Groups? Auditing Anonymization's Impact on ML Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns. Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and $t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness, evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to fourfold. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable guidelines for responsible AI development. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hharcolezi/anonymity-impact-fairness.</description>

      <title>Variational Visual Question Answering for Uncertainty-Aware Selective Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in recent years, vision language models (VLMs) remain prone to overconfidence and hallucinations on tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Visual Reasoning. Bayesian methods can potentially improve reliability by helping models selectively predict, that is, models respond only when they are sufficiently confident. Unfortunately, Bayesian methods are often assumed to be costly and ineffective for large models, and so far there exists little evidence to show otherwise, especially for multimodal applications. Here, we show the effectiveness and competitive edge of variational Bayes for selective prediction in VQA for the first time. We build on recent advances in variational methods for deep learning and propose an extension called "Variational VQA". This method improves calibration and yields significant gains for selective prediction on VQA and Visual Reasoning, particularly when the error tolerance is low ($\leq 1\%$). Often, just one posterior sample can yield more reliable answers than those obtained by models trained with AdamW. In addition, we propose a new risk-averse selector that outperforms standard sample averaging by considering the variance of predictions. Overall, we present compelling evidence that variational learning is a viable option to make large VLMs safer and more trustworthy.</description>

      <title>SageAttention3: Microscaling FP4 Attention for Inference and An Exploration of 8-Bit Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of attention is important due to its quadratic time complexity. We enhance the efficiency of attention through two key contributions: First, we leverage the new FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell GPUs to accelerate attention computation. Our implementation achieves 1038 TOPS on RTX5090, which is a 5x speedup over the fastest FlashAttention on RTX5090. Experiments show that our FP4 attention can accelerate inference of various models in a plug-and-play way. Second, we pioneer low-bit attention to training tasks. Existing low-bit attention works like FlashAttention3 and SageAttention focus only on inference. However, the efficiency of training large models is also important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied to training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both forward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention achieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower convergence in pretraining tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.</description>

      <title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including U-ViT, DiT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.</description>

      <title>R$^2$ec: Towards Large Recommender Models with Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. In this work, we propose R$^2$ec, a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capability. R$^2$ec introduces a dual-head architecture that supports both reasoning chain generation and efficient item prediction in a single model, significantly reducing inference latency. To overcome the lack of annotated reasoning data, we design RecPO, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning and recommendation jointly with a novel fused reward mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that R$^2$ec outperforms traditional, LLM-based, and reasoning-augmented recommender baselines, while further analyses validate its competitive efficiency among conventional LLM-based recommender baselines and strong adaptability to diverse recommendation scenarios.

      <title>GAIA: A Foundation Model for Operational Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GAIA (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence for Atmospheres), a hybrid self-supervised geospatial foundation model that fuses Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with self-distillation with no labels (DINO) to generate semantically rich representations from global geostationary satellite imagery. Pre-trained on 15 years of globally-merged infrared observations (2001-2015), GAIA learns disentangled representations that capture atmospheric dynamics rather than trivial diurnal patterns, as evidenced by distributed principal component structure and temporal coherence analysis. We demonstrate robust reconstruction capabilities across varying data availability (30-95% masking), achieving superior gap-filling performance on real missing data patterns. When transferred to downstream tasks, GAIA consistently outperforms an MAE-only baseline: improving atmospheric river segmentation (F1: 0.58 vs 0.52), enhancing tropical cyclone detection (storm-level recall: 81% vs 75%, early detection: 29% vs 17%), and maintaining competitive precipitation estimation performance. Analysis reveals that GAIA's hybrid objectives encourage learning of spatially coherent, object-centric features distributed across multiple principal components rather than concentrated representations focused on reconstruction. This work demonstrates that combining complementary self-supervised objectives yields more transferable representations for diverse atmospheric modeling tasks. Model weights and code are available at: https://huggingface.co/bcg-usra-nasa-gaia/GAIA-v1.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessments for Offensive Cybersecurity Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18384v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Metrics and Benchmarks of Video Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), which aims to detect anomalies that deviate from expectation, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing advancements in VAD primarily focus on model architectures and training strategies, while devoting insufficient attention to evaluation metrics and benchmarks. In this paper, we rethink VAD evaluation methods through comprehensive analyses, revealing three critical limitations in current practices: 1) existing metrics are significantly influenced by single annotation bias; 2) current metrics fail to reward early detection of anomalies; 3) available benchmarks lack the capability to evaluate scene overfitting of fully/weakly-supervised algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose three novel evaluation methods: first, we establish probabilistic AUC/AP (Prob-AUC/AP) metrics utlizing multi-round annotations to mitigate single annotation bias; second, we develop a Latency-aware Average Precision (LaAP) metric that rewards early and accurate anomaly detection; and finally, we introduce two hard normal benchmarks (UCF-HN, MSAD-HN) with videos specifically designed to evaluate scene overfitting. We report performance comparisons of ten state-of-the-art VAD approaches using our proposed evaluation methods, providing novel perspectives for future VAD model development. We release our data and code in https://github.com/Kamino666/RethinkingVAD.</description>

      <title>SC-LoRA: Balancing Efficient Fine-tuning and Knowledge Preservation via Subspace-Constrained LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal View Enhanced Large Vision Models for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series, typically represented as numerical sequences, can also be transformed into images and texts, offering multi-modal views (MMVs) of the same underlying signal. These MMVs can reveal complementary patterns and enable the use of powerful pre-trained large models, such as large vision models (LVMs), for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). However, as we identified in this work, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LVM-based forecaster poses an inductive bias towards "forecasting periods". To harness this bias, we propose DMMV, a novel decomposition-based multi-modal view framework that leverages trend-seasonal decomposition and a novel backcast-residual based adaptive decomposition to integrate MMVs for LTSF. Comparative evaluations against 14 SOTA models across diverse datasets show that DMMV outperforms single-view and existing multi-modal baselines, achieving the best mean squared error (MSE) on 6 out of 8 benchmark datasets. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/D2I-Group/dmmv.</description>

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion. Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots. However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help. However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support individuals during challenging emotional periods.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Adaptive Parallel Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PoLAR: Polar-Decomposed Low-Rank Adapter Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.</description>

      <title>UdonCare: Hierarchy Pruning for Unseen Domain Discovery in Predictive Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Healthcare providers often divide patient populations into cohorts based on shared clinical factors, such as medical history, to deliver personalized healthcare services. This idea has also been adopted in clinical prediction models, where it presents a vital challenge: capturing both global and cohort-specific patterns while enabling model generalization to unseen domains. Addressing this challenge falls under the scope of domain generalization (DG). However, conventional DG approaches often struggle in clinical settings due to the absence of explicit domain labels and the inherent gap in medical knowledge. To address this, we propose UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided method that iteratively divides patients into latent domains and decomposes domain-invariant (label) information from patient data. Our method identifies patient domains by pruning medical ontologies (e.g. ICD-9-CM hierarchy). On two public datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, UdonCare shows superiority over eight baselines across four clinical prediction tasks with substantial domain gaps, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge in guiding clinical domain generalization problems.</description>

      <title>DeepVideo-R1: Video Reinforcement Fine-Tuning via Difficulty-aware Regressive GRPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07464v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success using a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-normalized rewards. However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) has still been less studyed. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two problems that deteriorate the effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function into a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as the clipping and min functions. It directly aligns the model with advantages, providing guidance to prefer better ones. The difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy augments input prompts/videos to locate the difficulty of samples at solvable difficulty levels, enabling diverse reward signals. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Combinatorial Optimization of Design Structure Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the dependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that rely solely on mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM sequencing-a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases demonstrate that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.</description>

      <title>Graph Diffusion that can Insert and Delete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models of graphs based on discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) offer a principled approach to molecular generation by systematically removing structural noise through iterative atom and bond adjustments. However, existing formulations are fundamentally limited by their inability to adapt the graph size (that is, the number of atoms) during the diffusion process, severely restricting their effectiveness in conditional generation scenarios such as property-driven molecular design, where the targeted property often correlates with the molecular size. In this paper, we reformulate the noising and denoising processes to support monotonic insertion and deletion of nodes. The resulting model, which we call GrIDDD, dynamically grows or shrinks the chemical graph during generation. GrIDDD matches or exceeds the performance of existing graph diffusion models on molecular property targeting despite being trained on a more difficult problem. Furthermore, when applied to molecular optimization, GrIDDD exhibits competitive performance compared to specialized optimization models. This work paves the way for size-adaptive molecular generation with graph diffusion.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Prediction of Clinical Trial Enrollment with Uncertainty Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models.</description>

      <title>LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically demonstrated threat is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on evaluations by AI models or their developers. A promising defense is to monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably: they bypass the monitor 16-36% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models. These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.</description>

      <title>SafePLUG: Empowering Multimodal LLMs with Pixel-Level Insight and Temporal Grounding for Traffic Accident Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding. These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at: https://zihaosheng.github.io/SafePLUG</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When online sellers use AI learning algorithms to automatically compete on e-commerce platforms, there is concern that they will learn to coordinate on higher than competitive prices. However, this concern was primarily raised in single-dimension price competition. We investigate whether this prediction holds when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. We analyze competition in multi-agent reinforcement learning, and use a large-scale dataset from Amazon.com to provide empirical evidence. We show that when consumers have high search costs, learning algorithms can coordinate on prices lower than competitive prices, facilitating a win-win-win for consumers, sellers, and platforms. This occurs because algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices and enlarging demand on the platform. We also show that our results generalize to any learning algorithm that uses exploration of price and advertising bids. Consistent with our predictions, an empirical analysis shows that price levels exhibit a negative interaction between estimated consumer search costs and algorithm usage index. We analyze the platform's strategic response and find that reserve price adjustments will not increase platform profits, but commission adjustments will, while maintaining the beneficial outcomes for both sellers and consumers.</description>

      <title>Decoding Latent Attack Surfaces in LLMs: Prompt Injection via HTML in Web Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into web-based systems for content summarization, yet their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks remains a pressing concern. In this study, we explore how non-visible HTML elements such as &lt;meta&gt;, aria-label, and alt attributes can be exploited to embed adversarial instructions without altering the visible content of a webpage. We introduce a novel dataset comprising 280 static web pages, evenly divided between clean and adversarial injected versions, crafted using diverse HTML-based strategies. These pages are processed through a browser automation pipeline to extract both raw HTML and rendered text, closely mimicking real-world LLM deployment scenarios. We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source models, Llama 4 Scout (Meta) and Gemma 9B IT (Google), on their ability to summarize this content. Using both lexical (ROUGE-L) and semantic (SBERT cosine similarity) metrics, along with manual annotations, we assess the impact of these covert injections. Our findings reveal that over 29% of injected samples led to noticeable changes in the Llama 4 Scout summaries, while Gemma 9B IT showed a lower, yet non-trivial, success rate of 15%. These results highlight a critical and largely overlooked vulnerability in LLM driven web pipelines, where hidden adversarial content can subtly manipulate model outputs. Our work offers a reproducible framework and benchmark for evaluating HTML-based prompt injection and underscores the urgent need for robust mitigation strategies in LLM applications involving web content.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Based Smooth Policy Regularisation for Reinforcement Learning with Few Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous, uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at https://github.com/YujieZhu7/SPReD.</description>

      <title>PartnerMAS: An LLM Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Business Partner Selection on High-Dimensional Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection, involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</description>

      <title>BALR-SAM: Boundary-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of SAM for Resource-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</description>

      <title>PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization results can be found on the project page: https://haozhuo-zhang.github.io/PoseDiff-project-page/.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Reasoning Capabilities in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Invariant Feature Decoupling in Source-free Time Series Forecasting with Proxy Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models (LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities. Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.</description>

      <title>LLM Based Long Code Translation using Identifier Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</description>

      <title>SVTime: Small Time Series Forecasting Models Informed by "Physics" of Large Vision Model Forecasters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF -- and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets, SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training and inference in low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Firm Productivity: Field Experiments in Online Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on firm productivity through a series of large-scale randomized field experiments involving millions of users and products at a leading cross-border online retail platform. Over six months in 2023-2024, GenAI-based enhancements were integrated into seven consumer-facing business workflows. We find that GenAI adoption significantly increases sales, with treatment effects ranging from $0\%$ to $16.3\%$, depending on GenAI's marginal contribution relative to existing firm practices. Because inputs and prices were held constant across experimental arms, these gains map directly into total factor productivity improvements. Across the four GenAI applications with positive effects, the implied annual incremental value is approximately $\$ 5$ per consumer-an economically meaningful impact given the retailer's scale and the early stage of GenAI adoption. The primary mechanism operates through higher conversion rates, consistent with GenAI reducing frictions in the marketplace and improving consumer experience. We also document substantial heterogeneity: smaller and newer sellers, as well as less experienced consumers, exhibit disproportionately larger gains. Our findings provide novel, large-scale causal evidence on the productivity effects of GenAI in online retail, highlighting both its immediate value and broader potential.</description>

      <title>DrivAerStar: An Industrial-Grade CFD Dataset for Vehicle Aerodynamic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using STAR-CCM+${}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.</description>

      <title>CARE: Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Alignment-Calibration Trade-off: A Pareto-Superior Frontier via Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.</description>

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.</description>

      <title>{\epsilon}-Seg: Sparsely Supervised Semantic Segmentation of Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking, sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior, and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally, instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on 2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that {\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited amounts of training labels are available.</description>

      <title>SmartMixed: A Two-Phase Training Strategy for Adaptive Activation Function Learning in Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks, yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional diversity within neural architectures.</description>

      <title>E2Rank: Your Text Embedding can Also be an Effective and Efficient Listwise Reranker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework E2Rank, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, E2Rank achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.</description>

      <title>DINO-YOLO: Self-Supervised Pre-training for Data-Efficient Object Detection in Civil Engineering Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3). Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead (21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil engineering datasets (&lt;10K images) while preserving computational efficiency, providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Transformers in Medicine: Improving Vision-Language Alignment for Medical Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting.</description>

      <title>'Studies for': A Human-AI Co-Creative Sound Artwork Using a Real-time Multi-channel Sound Generation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of AI technologies into the artistic workflow through the creation of Studies for, a generative sound installation developed in collaboration with sound artist Evala (https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/archive/works/studies-for/). The installation employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model, to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The work is grounded in the concept of a "new form of archive," which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.
  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3) ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new, previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of "a new form of archive." We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.

      <title>MMEdge: Accelerating On-device Multimodal Inference via Pipelined Sensing and Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.</description>

      <title>TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes, and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance, outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference. We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code, providing a reproducible foundation for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CodeSight is an end-to-end system designed to anticipate deadline compliance in software development workflows. It captures development and deployment data directly from GitHub, transforming it into process mining logs for detailed analysis. From these logs, the system generates metrics and dashboards that provide actionable insights into PR activity patterns and workflow efficiency. Building on this structured representation, CodeSight employs an LSTM model that predicts remaining PR resolution times based on sequential activity traces and static features, enabling early identification of potential deadline breaches. In tests, the system demonstrates high precision and F1 scores in predicting deadline compliance, illustrating the value of integrating process mining with machine learning for proactive software project management.</description>

      <title>Aeolus: A Multi-structural Flight Delay Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and (iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning, serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Flnny/Delay-data</description>

      <title>The End of Manual Decoding: Towards Truly End-to-End Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from "hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., "generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.</description>

      <title>On the limitation of evaluating machine unlearning using only a single training seed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically. Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model training. We therefore recommend that empirical comparisons of MU algorithms should also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.</description>

      <title>Non-Convex Over-the-Air Heterogeneous Federated Learning: A Bias-Variance Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.</description>

      <title>Faithful and Fast Influence Function via Advanced Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models? Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.</description>
