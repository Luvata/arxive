      <title>To Deceive is to Teach? Forging Perceptual Robustness via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Patient-Centered, Graph-Augmented Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Passive Surveillance for Early Stroke Risk Detection in High-Risk Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke affected millions annually, yet poor symptom recognition often delayed care-seeking. To address risk recognition gap, we developed a passive surveillance system for early stroke risk detection using patient-reported symptoms among individuals with diabetes. Constructing a symptom taxonomy grounded in patients own language and a dual machine learning pipeline (heterogeneous GNN and EN/LASSO), we identified symptom patterns associated with subsequent stroke. We translated findings into a hybrid risk screening system integrating symptom relevance and temporal proximity, evaluated across 3-90 day windows through EHR-based simulations. Under conservative thresholds, intentionally designed to minimize false alerts, the screening system achieved high specificity (1.00) and prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value (1.00), with good sensitivity (0.72), an expected trade-off prioritizing precision, that was highest in 90-day window. Patient-reported language alone supported high-precision, low-burden early stroke risk detection, that could offer a valuable time window for clinical evaluation and intervention for high-risk individuals.</description>

      <title>Improving Spatial Allocation for Energy System Coupling with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In energy system analysis, coupling models with mismatched spatial resolutions is a significant challenge. A common solution is assigning weights to high-resolution geographic units for aggregation, but traditional models are limited by using only a single geospatial attribute. This paper presents an innovative method employing a self-supervised Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to address this issue. This method models high-resolution geographic units as graph nodes, integrating various geographical features to generate physically meaningful weights for each grid point. These weights enhance the conventional Voronoi-based allocation method, allowing it to go beyond simply geographic proximity by incorporating essential geographic information.In addition, the self-supervised learning paradigm overcomes the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that applying weights generated by this method to cluster-based Voronoi Diagrams significantly enhances scalability, accuracy, and physical plausibility, while increasing precision compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Zatom-1: A Multimodal Flow Foundation Model for 3D Molecules and Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Causal Direction from Convergence Time: Faster Training in the True Causal Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Causal Computational Asymmetry (CCA), a principle for causal direction identification based on optimization dynamics in which one neural network is trained to predict $Y$ from $X$ and another to predict $X$ from $Y$, and the direction that converges faster is inferred to be causal. Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \varepsilon$ with $\varepsilon \perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Deep Sequence Modeling with Quantum Dynamics: Language as a Wave Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $\Omega(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Weight Modification Enhances Learning Scalability and Convergence Efficiency without Gradient Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing the substantial computational cost of backpropagation (BP), non-BP methods have emerged as attractive alternatives for efficient learning on emerging neuromorphic systems. However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Code World Models for Parameter Control in Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p&lt;0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LLM Inference using Context-Aware Model Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) &gt;= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -&gt; 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.</description>

      <title>WaveSSM: Multiscale State-Space Models for Non-stationary Signal Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful foundation for long-range sequence modeling, with the HiPPO framework showing that continuous-time projection operators can be used to derive stable, memory-efficient dynamical systems that encode the past history of the input signal. However, existing projection-based SSMs often rely on polynomial bases with global temporal support, whose inductive biases are poorly matched to signals exhibiting localized or transient structure. In this work, we introduce \emph{WaveSSM}, a collection of SSMs constructed over wavelet frames. Our key observation is that wavelet frames yield a localized support on the temporal dimension, useful for tasks requiring precise localization. Empirically, we show that on equal conditions, \textit{WaveSSM} outperforms orthogonal counterparts as S4 on real-world datasets with transient dynamics, including physiological signals on the PTB-XL dataset and raw audio on Speech Commands.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Supervision of a Thermal-Hydraulic Process Towards a Physics-Based Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time supervision of production processes is a common challenge across several industries. It targets process component monitoring and its predictive maintenance in order to ensure safety, uninterrupted production and maintain high efficiency level. The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system. The numerical results show good accuracy in terms of parameter variation localization and the update of their values.</description>

      <title>AutoQRA: Joint Optimization of Mixed-Precision Quantization and Low-rank Adapters for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.</description>

      <title>CQSA: Byzantine-robust Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.</description>

      <title>Prior Knowledge-enhanced Spatio-temporal Epidemic Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at one provincial CDC in China to facilitate downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Support Tokens, Stability Margins, and a New Foundation for Robust LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.</description>

      <title>Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network for Large-Scale Traffic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting has emerged as an indispensable mission for daily life, which is required to utilize the spatiotemporal relationship between each location within a time period under a graph structure to predict future flow. However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state). Further analysis demonstrates the efficacy of newly introduced modules either.</description>

      <title>X-REFINE: XAI-based RElevance input-Filtering and archItecture fiNe-tuning for channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-native architectures are vital for 6G wireless communications. The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models employed in critical applications, such as channel estimation, limit their practical deployment. While perturbation-based XAI solutions offer input filtering, they often neglect internal structural optimization. We propose X-REFINE, an XAI-based framework for joint input-filtering and architecture fine-tuning. By utilizing a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule, X-REFINE backpropagates predictions to derive high-resolution relevance scores for both subcarriers and hidden neurons. This enables a holistic optimization that identifies the most faithful model components. Simulation results demonstrate that X-REFINE achieves a superior interpretability-performance-complexity trade-off, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning Ensembles and Large Language Models for Heart Disease Prediction Using Voting Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.</description>

      <title>BrepCoder: A Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Multi-task B-rep Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have actively addressed complex challenges within the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) domain.However, most existing approaches rely on task-specifi c models requiring structural modifi cations for new tasks, and they predominantly focus on point clouds or images rather than the industry-standard Boundary Representation (B-rep) format. To address these limitations, we propose BrepCoder, a unifi ed Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs diverse CAD tasks from B-rep inputs. By leveraging the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we convert CAD modeling sequences into Python-like code and align them with B-rep. We then adopt a two-stage training strategy: First, pre-training on reverse engineering to learn geometric features and design logic. Second, eff ectively extending the model to various downstream tasks such as completion, error correction, and CAD-QA. Consequently, by interpreting B-rep as structural code, BrepCoder achieves superior generalization across diverse tasks, demonstrating its potential as a general-purpose CAD agent.</description>

      <title>Early Risk Stratification of Dosing Errors in Clinical Trials Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.</description>

      <title>OmniZip: Learning a Unified and Lightweight Lossless Compressor for Multi-Modal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \textbf{OmniZip}, \textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\%, 57\%, 62\% and 42\%, 53\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively. It also supports near real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices, reaching about 1MB/s on MacBook CPUs and iPhone NPUs. Our code is released at https://github.com/adminasmi/OmniZip-CVPR2026.</description>

      <title>Reliable XAI Explanations in Sudden Cardiac Death Prediction for Chagas Cardiomyopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.</description>

      <title>Manifold of Failure: Behavioral Attraction Basins in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Global River Forecasting with a Topology-Informed AI Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.</description>

      <title>When Should a Model Change Its Mind? An Energy-Based Theory and Regularizer for Concept Drift in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.</description>

      <title>UpSkill: Mutual Information Skill Learning for Structured Response Diversity in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) on mathematics and programming tasks, but standard approaches that optimize single-attempt accuracy can inadvertently suppress response diversity across repeated attempts, narrowing exploration and overlooking underrepresented strategies. We introduce UpSkill, a training time method that adapts Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) to LLMs for optimizing pass@k correctness. We propose a novel reward that we implement within Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO): a token-level mutual information (MI) reward that encourages trajectory specificity to z. Experiments on GSM8K with three open-weight models, Llama 3.1-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, and R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, show that UpSkill improves multi-attempt metrics on the stronger base models, yielding mean gains of ~3% in pass@k for both Qwen and Llama without degrading pass@1. Additionally, we find both empirical and theoretical evidence that improvements in pass@k are closely tied to the mutual information objective.</description>

      <title>Learning Rewards, Not Labels: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Machinery Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.</description>

      <title>AviaSafe: A Physics-Informed Data-Driven Model for Aviation Safety-Critical Cloud Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current AI weather forecasting models predict conventional atmospheric variables but cannot distinguish between cloud microphysical species critical for aviation safety. We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk.</description>

      <title>Training Agents to Self-Report Misbehavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.</description>

      <title>A 1/R Law for Kurtosis Contrast in Balanced Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|\kappa(y)|=O(\kappa_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_b\kappa_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim \kappa_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $\Omega(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.</description>

      <title>Structure and Redundancy in Large Language Models: A Spectral Study via Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.</description>

      <title>Learning geometry-dependent lead-field operators for forward ECG modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5{\deg}) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error &lt;2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Shared and Target-Enriched Topics via Background-Contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.</description>

      <title>Predicting Multi-Drug Resistance in Bacterial Isolates Through Performance Comparison and LIME-based Interpretation of Classification Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>MolFM-Lite: Multi-Modal Molecular Property Prediction with Conformer Ensemble Attention and Cross-Modal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Based Hybrid Decision Framework for Matching Systems with User Departure Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In matching markets such as kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching has been shown to improve overall market efficiency. The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Chebyshev Polynomial and Anisotropic RBF Models for Tabular Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.
  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.
  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Test-Time Guidance for Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time guidance is a widely used mechanism for steering pretrained diffusion models toward outcomes specified by a reward function. Existing approaches, however, focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. In this work, we show that common test-time guidance methods do not recover the correct posterior distribution and identify the structural approximations responsible for this failure. We then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior. We significantly outperform previous methods on a set of Bayesian inference tasks, and match state-of-the-art in black hole image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>From Bias to Balance: Fairness-Aware Paper Recommendation for Equitable Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.</description>

      <title>ECHO: Encoding Communities via High-order Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

      <title>Beyond performance-wise Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Continual Learning in Language Models via Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-aware Knowledge Distillation for LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.</description>

      <title>Sharp Convergence Rates for Masked Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Space Syntax-guided Post-training for Residential Floor Plan Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.</description>

      <title>TEFL: Prediction-Residual-Guided Rolling Forecasting for Multi-Horizon Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting Tennis Serve directions with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Learning of Dynamic Causal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.</description>

      <title>Persistent Nonnegative Matrix Factorization via Multi-Scale Graph Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.</description>

      <title>LUMOS: Democratizing SciML Workflows with L0-Regularized Learning for Unified Feature and Parameter Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate LUMOS across 13 diverse SciML workloads, including cosmology and molecular sciences, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. Experiments on 13 SciML models show that LUMOS achieves 71.45% parameter reduction and a 6.4x inference speedup on average. Furthermore, Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on up to eight GPUs confirms the scalability of</description>

      <title>RAIN-Merging: A Gradient-Free Method to Enhance Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models with Preserved Thinking Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning &amp; general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.</description>

      <title>Relatron: Automating Relational Machine Learning over Relational Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Visual Decoding from EEG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Stable Adaptive Thinking via Advantage Shaping and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing Fairness: Post-Hoc Threshold Optimization Under Hard Resource Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>S2O: Early Stopping for Sparse Attention via Online Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.</description>

      <title>IBCircuit: Towards Holistic Circuit Discovery with Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.</description>

      <title>TabDLM: Free-Form Tabular Data Generation via Joint Numerical-Language Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.</description>

      <title>pQuant: Towards Effective Low-Bit Language Models via Decoupled Linear Quantization-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>Transformers converge to invariant algorithmic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.</description>

      <title>$\phi$-DPO: Fairness Direct Preference Optimization Approach to Continual Learning in Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $\phi$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $\phi$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $\phi$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $\phi$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.</description>

      <title>DP-aware AdaLN-Zero: Taming Conditioning-Induced Heavy-Tailed Gradients in Differentially Private Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Membership Inference in Intermediate Representations via Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.</description>

      <title>Semantic Tube Prediction: Beating LLM Data Efficiency with JEPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling. Code is available at https://github.com/galilai-group/llm-jepa#stp.</description>

      <title>ContextRL: Enhancing MLLM's Knowledge Discovery Efficiency with Context-Augmented RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.</description>

      <title>Tackling Privacy Heterogeneity in Differentially Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.</description>

      <title>Compress the Easy, Explore the Hard: Difficulty-Aware Entropy Regularization for Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.</description>

      <title>LEDA: Latent Semantic Distribution Alignment for Multi-domain Graph Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Antimicrobial Resistance Trends Using Machine Learning on WHO GLASS Surveillance Data: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Approach for Policy Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

      <title>Accelerating LLM Pre-Training through Flat-Direction Dynamics Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training. The code is available at https://github.com/SHUCHENZHU/LITE.</description>

      <title>Switch-Hurdle: A MoE Encoder with AR Hurdle Decoder for Intermittent Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Geometric Perception in VLMs via Translator-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

      <title>Interpreting and Steering State-Space Models via Activation Subspace Bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient strategy for building powerful language models, avoiding the quadratic complexity of computing attention in transformers. Despite their promise, the interpretability and steerability of modern SSMs remain relatively underexplored. We take a major step in this direction by identifying activation subspace bottlenecks in the Mamba family of SSM models using tools from mechanistic interpretability. We then introduce a test-time steering intervention that simply multiplies the activations of the identified bottlenecks by a scalar. Across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, this intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27%, without requiring any task-specific tuning. Finally, we validate that the identified bottlenecks are indeed hindering performance by modifying them to yield an architecture we call Stable-Mamba, which achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch.</description>

      <title>Set-based v.s. Distribution-based Representations of Epistemic Uncertainty: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.</description>

      <title>KMLP: A Scalable Hybrid Architecture for Web-Scale Tabular Data Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges. These features exhibit anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, and non-stationarity, creating bottlenecks for models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and requiring laborious manual feature engineering. We introduce KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture integrating a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. The KAN front-end uses learnable activation functions to automatically model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, while the gMLP backbone captures high-order interactions. Experiments on public benchmarks and an industrial dataset with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over baselines like GBDTs increasing at larger scales, validating KMLP as a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data.</description>

      <title>Doubly Adaptive Channel and Spatial Attention for Semantic Image Communication by IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks face significant challenges such as limited communication bandwidth, constrained computational and energy resources, and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions. Utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has recently been proposed to enable semantic communication of images. Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement. As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent imitation learning with function approximation: Linear Markov games and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Local LLMs on Resource-Constrained Edge Devices via Distributed Prompt Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

      <title>Hypernetwork-based approach for grid-independent functional data clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.</description>

      <title>Moral Preferences of LLMs Under Directed Contextual Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Ranking Aggregation: Gossip Algorithms for Borda and Copeland Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.</description>

      <title>MEDNA-DFM: A Dual-View FiLM-MoE Model for Explainable DNA Methylation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Fair feature attribution for multi-output prediction: a Shapley-based perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach to Support Clinical Renal Replacement Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a data-driven machine learning approach to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.</description>

      <title>NoRA: Breaking the Linear Ceiling of Low-Rank Adaptation via Manifold Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bounds of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Homogeneous Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $\eta_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $\Omega(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.</description>

      <title>MSINO: Curvature-Aware Sobolev Optimization for Manifold Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Manifold Sobolev Informed Neural Optimization (MSINO), a curvature aware training framework for neural networks defined on Riemannian manifolds. The method replaces standard Euclidean derivative supervision with a covariant Sobolev loss that aligns gradients using parallel transport and improves stability via a Laplace Beltrami smoothness regularization term.
  Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.
  Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians. Applications include surface imaging, physics informed learning settings, and robotics on Lie groups such as SO(3) and SE(3). The framework unifies value and gradient based learning with curvature aware convergence guarantees for neural training on manifolds.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws of Global Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling for Predicting and Preventing Transformer Training Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training divergence in transformers wastes compute, yet practitioners discover instability only after expensive runs begin. They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher. These findings generalize to WikiText-103 language modeling, vision transformers on CIFAR-10, and pretrained language models, including GPT-2 and LLaMA-2 up to 7B, as well as emerging architectures such as MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Memory-Augmented LLM Agent via Hybrid On- and Off-Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>Learning Disease-Sensitive Latent Interaction Graphs From Noisy Cardiac Flow Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|\rho|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep state-space models (DSSMs) enable temporal predictions by learning the underlying dynamics of observed sequence data. They are often trained by maximising the evidence lower bound. However, as we show, this does not ensure the model actually learns the underlying dynamics. We therefore propose a constrained optimisation framework as a general approach for training DSSMs. Building upon this, we introduce the extended Kalman VAE (EKVAE), which combines amortised variational inference with classic Bayesian filtering/smoothing to model dynamics more accurately than RNN-based DSSMs. Our results show that the constrained optimisation framework significantly improves system identification and prediction accuracy on the example of established state-of-the-art DSSMs. The EKVAE outperforms previous models w.r.t. prediction accuracy, achieves remarkable results in identifying dynamical systems, and can furthermore successfully learn state-space representations where static and dynamic features are disentangled.</description>

      <title>RhythmBERT: A Self-Supervised Language Model Based on Latent Representations of ECG Waveforms for Heart Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural particle flow for the Bayesian update step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>PRAC: Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression and Memory-Efficient Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Learning Physical Operators using Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but struggle to generalise beyond training distributions and are often constrained to a fixed temporal discretisation. This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics.</description>

      <title>Regularized Online RLHF with Generalized Bilinear Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $\eta^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(\eta)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\eta d^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\eta r T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bound to Disagree: Generalization Bounds via Certifiable Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization bounds for deep learning models are typically vacuous, not computable or restricted to specific model classes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by providing new disagreement-based certificates for the gap between the true risk of any two predictors. We then bound the true risk of the predictor of interest via a surrogate model that enjoys tight generalization guarantees, and evaluating our disagreement bound on an unlabeled dataset. We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory. Importantly, such guarantees are achieved without modifying the target model, nor adapting the training procedure to the generalization framework.</description>

      <title>DyGnROLE: Modeling Asymmetry in Dynamic Graphs with Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Diffusion Coefficients in Mixtures with Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.</description>

      <title>Partial recovery of meter-scale surface weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Temporal Web3 Intelligence: Lessons from the FinSurvival 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.</description>

      <title>MetaOthello: A Controlled Study of Multiple World Models in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting "world models". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.</description>

      <title>Induction Meets Biology: Mechanisms of Repeat Detection in Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap on tabular data with Fourier and Implicit Categorical Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Deep Learning has demonstrated impressive results in applications on various data types, it continues to lag behind tree-based methods when applied to tabular data, often referred to as the last "unconquered castle" for neural networks. We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient Real-Time Adaptation of ROMs for Unsteady Flows Using Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.</description>

      <title>InnerQ: Hardware-aware Tuning-free Quantization of KV Cache for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.</description>

      <title>Tell Me What To Learn: Generalizing Neural Memory to be Controllable in Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.</description>

      <title>Takeuchi's Information Criteria as Generalization Measures for DNNs Close to NTK Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization measures have been studied extensively in the machine learning community to better characterize generalization gaps. However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Viscous Value Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

      <title>Conformalized Neural Networks for Federated Uncertainty Quantification under Dual Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.</description>

      <title>Inferential Mechanics Part 1: Causal Mechanistic Theories of Machine Learning in Chemical Biology with Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe. Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.</description>

      <title>A Proper Scoring Rule for Virtual Staining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.</description>

      <title>ParamMem: Augmenting Language Agents with Parametric Reflective Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Zero-One Loss via Hypersimplex Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.</description>

      <title>Mean Estimation from Coarse Data: Characterizations and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]</description>

      <title>FlashOptim: Optimizers for Memory Efficient Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.
  We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.
  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.</description>

      <title>SOTAlign: Semi-Supervised Alignment of Unimodal Vision and Language Models via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>A Dataset is Worth 1 MB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.</description>

      <title>Model Agreement via Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.
  We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural routing solvers (NRSs) that leverage deep learning to tackle vehicle routing problems have demonstrated notable potential for practical applications. By learning implicit heuristic rules from data, NRSs replace the handcrafted counterparts in classic heuristic frameworks, thereby reducing reliance on costly manual design and trial-and-error adjustments. This survey makes two main contributions: (1) The heuristic nature of NRSs is highlighted, and existing NRSs are reviewed from the perspective of heuristics. A hierarchical taxonomy based on heuristic principles is further introduced. (2) A generalization-focused evaluation pipeline is proposed to address limitations of the conventional pipeline. Comparative benchmarking of representative NRSs across both pipelines uncovers a series of previously unreported gaps in current research.</description>

      <title>Solving stiff dark matter equations via Jacobian Normalization with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff differential equations pose a major challenge for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), often causing poor convergence. We propose a simple, hyperparameter-free method to address stiffness by normalizing loss residuals with the Jacobian. We provide theoretical indications that Jacobian-based normalization can improve gradient descent and validate it on benchmark stiff ordinary differential equations. We then apply it to a realistic system: the stiff Boltzmann equations (BEs) governing weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM). Our approach achieves higher accuracy than attention mechanisms previously proposed for handling stiffness, recovering the full solution where prior methods fail. This is further demonstrated in an inverse problem with a single experimental data point - the observed DM relic density - where our inverse PINNs correctly infer the cross section that solves the BEs in both Standard and alternative cosmologies.</description>

      <title>SQaLe: A Large Text-to-SQL Corpus Grounded in Real Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in large language models have accelerated progress in text-to-SQL, methods for converting natural language queries into valid SQL queries. A key bottleneck for developing generalizable text-to-SQL models is the lack of large-scale datasets with sufficient schema and query complexity, domain coverage, and task diversity. We introduce SQaLe: a large-scale semi-synthetic text-to-SQL dataset built on 135,875 relational database schemas expanded from a collection of real-world schemas, SchemaPile. We establish a principled generation pipeline which combines schema sampling, question synthesis, and SQL construction, and produce 517,676 high-quality (question, schema, query) triples. The SQaLe dataset captures realistic schema size variability, diverse query patterns, and natural language ambiguity while maintaining execution validity. We provide an analysis of its contents and characteristics, and find that SQaLe introduces the most realistic large-scale text-to-SQL dataset to date in comparison with existing benchmarks and datasets. We discuss how SQaLe enables our vision for data scaling and model generalization in text-to-SQL research. The dataset is accessible at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-lab/SQaLe-text-to-SQL-dataset.</description>

      <title>SmartChunk Retrieval: Query-Aware Chunk Compression with Planning for Efficient Document RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has strong potential for producing accurate and factual outputs by combining language models (LMs) with evidence retrieved from large text corpora. However, current pipelines are limited by static chunking and flat retrieval: documents are split into short, predetermined, fixed-size chunks, embeddings are retrieved uniformly, and generation relies on whatever chunks are returned. This design brings challenges, as retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunk size, often introduces noise from irrelevant or misleading chunks, and scales poorly to large corpora. We present SmartChunk retrieval, a query-adaptive framework for efficient and robust long-document question answering (QA). SmartChunk uses (i) a planner that predicts the optimal chunk abstraction level for each query, and (ii) a lightweight compression module that produces high-level chunk embeddings without repeated summarization. By adapting retrieval granularity on the fly, SmartChunk balances accuracy with efficiency and avoids the drawbacks of fixed strategies. Notably, our planner can reason about chunk abstractions through a novel reinforcement learning scheme, STITCH, which boosts accuracy and generalization. To reflect real-world applications, where users face diverse document types and query styles, we evaluate SmartChunk on five QA benchmarks plus one out-of-domain dataset. Across these evaluations, SmartChunk outperforms state-of-the-art RAG baselines, while reducing cost. Further analysis demonstrates strong scalability with larger corpora and consistent gains on out-of-domain datasets, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for adaptive retrieval.</description>

      <title>SEGB: Self-Evolved Generative Bidding with Local Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, automated bidding has become a pivotal tool, enabling advertisers to efficiently capture impression opportunities in real-time. Recently, generative auto-bidding has shown significant promise, offering innovative solutions for effective ad optimization. However, existing offline-trained generative policies lack the near-term foresight required for dynamic markets and usually depend on simulators or external experts for post-training improvement. To overcome these critical limitations, we propose Self-Evolved Generative Bidding (SEGB), a framework that plans proactively and refines itself entirely offline. SEGB first synthesizes plausible short-horizon future states to guide each bid, providing the agent with crucial, dynamic foresight. Crucially, it then performs value-guided policy refinement to iteratively discover superior strategies without any external intervention. This self-contained approach uniquely enables robust policy improvement from static data alone. Experiments on the AuctionNet benchmark and a large-scale A/B test validate our approach, demonstrating that SEGB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In a large-scale online deployment, it delivered substantial business value, achieving a +10.19% increase in target cost, proving the effectiveness of our advanced planning and evolution paradigm.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Multichain Blockchain: A Multiobjective Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains are widely used for secure transaction processing, but their scalability remains limited, and existing multichain designs are typically static even as demand and capacity shift. We cast blockchain configuration as a multiagent resource-allocation problem: applications and operators declare demand, capacity, and price bounds; an optimizer groups them into ephemeral chains each epoch and sets a chain-level clearing price. The objective maximizes a governance-weighted combination of normalized utilities for applications, operators, and the system. The model is modular -- accommodating capability compatibility, application-type diversity, and epoch-to-epoch stability -- and can be solved off-chain with outcomes verifiable on-chain. We analyze fairness and incentive issues and present simulations that highlight trade-offs among throughput, decentralization, operator yield, and service stability.</description>

      <title>FM-RME: Foundation Model Empowered Radio Map Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional radio map estimation (RME) techniques fail to capture multi-dimensional and dynamic characteristics of complex spectrum environments. Recent data-driven methods achieve accurate RME in spatial domain, but ignore physical prior knowledge of radio propagation, limiting data efficiency especially in multi-dimensional scenarios. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new foundation model, characterized by self-supervised pre-training on diverse data for zero-shot generalization, enabling multi-dimensional radio map estimation (FM-RME). Specifically, FM-RME builds an effective synergy of two core components: a geometry-aware feature extraction module that encodes physical propagation symmetries, i.e., translation and rotation invariance, as inductive bias, and an attention-based neural network that learns long-range correlations across the spatial-temporal-spectral domains. A masked self-supervised multi-dimensional pre-training strategy is further developed to learn generalizable spectrum representations across diverse wireless environments. Once pre-trained, FM-RME supports zero-shot inference for multi-dimensional RME, including spatial, temporal, and spectral estimation, without scenario-specific retraining. Simulation results verify that FM-RME exhibits desired learning performance across diverse datasets and zero-shot generalization capabilities beyond existing RME methods.</description>

      <title>CrossLLM-Mamba: Multimodal State Space Fusion of LLMs for RNA Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA-associated interactions is essential for understanding cellular regulation and advancing drug discovery. While Biological Large Language Models (BioLLMs) such as ESM-2 and RiNALMo provide powerful sequence representations, existing methods rely on static fusion strategies that fail to capture the dynamic, context-dependent nature of molecular binding. We introduce CrossLLM-Mamba, a novel framework that reformulates interaction prediction as a state-space alignment problem. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba encoders, our approach enables deep ``crosstalk'' between modality-specific embeddings through hidden state propagation, modeling interactions as dynamic sequence transitions rather than static feature overlaps. The framework maintains linear computational complexity, making it scalable to high-dimensional BioLLM embeddings. We further incorporate Gaussian noise injection and Focal Loss to enhance robustness against hard-negative samples. Comprehensive experiments across three interaction categories, RNA-protein, RNA-small molecule, and RNA-RNA demonstrate that CrossLLM-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the RPI1460 benchmark, our model attains an MCC of 0.892, surpassing the previous best by 5.2\%. For binding affinity prediction, we achieve Pearson correlations exceeding 0.95 on riboswitch and repeat RNA subtypes. These results establish state-space modeling as a powerful paradigm for multi-modal biological interaction prediction.</description>

      <title>VAE-MS: An Asymmetric Variational Autoencoder for Mutational Signature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutational signature analysis has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering the underlying biological processes driving cancer development. However, the signature extraction process, typically performed using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), often lacks reliability and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, several solutions have been introduced, including the use of neural networks to achieve more accurate estimates and probabilistic methods to better capture natural variation in the data. In this work, we introduce a Variational Autoencoder for Mutational Signatures (VAE-MS), a novel model that leverages both an asymmetric architecture and probabilistic methods for the extraction of mutational signatures. VAE-MS is compared to with three state-of-the-art models for mutational signature extraction: SigProfilerExtractor, the NMF-based gold standard; MUSE-XAE, an autoencoder that employs an asymmetric design without probabilistic components; and SigneR, a Bayesian NMF model, to illustrate the strength in combining a nonlinear extraction with a probabilistic model. In the ability to reconstruct input data and generalize to unseen data, models with probabilistic components (VAE-MS, SigneR) dramatically outperformed models without (SigProfilerExtractor, MUSE-XAE). The NMF-baed models (SigneR, SigProfilerExtractor) had the most accurate reconstructions in simulated data, while VAE-MS reconstructed more accurately on real cancer data. Upon evaluating the ability to extract signatures consistently, no model exhibited a clear advantage over the others. Software for VAE-MS is available at https://github.com/CLINDA-AAU/VAE-MS.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a formulation to express and optimize stochastic neural networks as quantum circuits in gate-based quantum computing. Motivated by a classical perceptron, stochastic neurons are introduced and combined into a quantum neural network. The Kiefer-Wolfowitz algorithm in combination with simulated annealing is used for training the network weights. Several topologies and models are presented, including shallow fully connected networks, Hopfield Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoders and convolutional neural networks. We also demonstrate the combination of our optimized neural networks as an oracle for the Grover algorithm to realize a quantum generative AI model.</description>

      <title>Self-Purification Mitigates Backdoors in Multimodal Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to their autoregressive counterparts. Yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show that well-established data-poisoning pipelines can successfully implant backdoors into MDLMs, enabling attackers to manipulate model behavior via specific triggers while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs. However, defense strategies effective to these models are yet to emerge. To bridge this gap, we introduce a backdoor defense framework for MDLMs named DiSP (Diffusion Self-Purification). DiSP is driven by a key observation: selectively masking certain vision tokens at inference time can neutralize a backdoored model's trigger-induced behaviors and restore normal functionality. Building on this, we purify the poisoned dataset using the compromised model itself, then fine-tune the model on the purified data to recover it to a clean one. Given such a specific design, DiSP can remove backdoors without requiring any auxiliary models or clean reference data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates backdoor effects, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) from over 90% to typically under 5%, while maintaining model performance on benign tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Spectral Geometry of Biological Knowledge in Single-Cell Transformer Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell foundation models such as scGPT learn high-dimensional gene representations, but what biological knowledge these representations encode remains unclear. We systematically decode the geometric structure of scGPT internal representations through 63 iterations of automated hypothesis screening (183 hypotheses tested), revealing that the model organizes genes into a structured biological coordinate system rather than an opaque feature space.
  The dominant spectral axis separates genes by subcellular localization, with secreted proteins at one pole and cytosolic proteins at the other. Intermediate transformer layers transiently encode mitochondrial and ER compartments in a sequence that mirrors the cellular secretory pathway. Orthogonal axes encode protein-protein interaction networks with graded fidelity to experimentally measured interaction strength (Spearman rho = 1.000 across n = 5 STRING confidence quintiles, p = 0.017).
  In a compact six-dimensional spectral subspace, the model distinguishes transcription factors from their target genes (AUROC = 0.744, all 12 layers significant). Early layers preserve which specific genes regulate which targets, while deeper layers compress this into a coarser regulator versus regulated distinction. Repression edges are geometrically more prominent than activation edges, and B-cell master regulators BATF and BACH2 show convergence toward the B-cell identity anchor PAX5 across transformer depth. Cell-type marker genes cluster with high fidelity (AUROC = 0.851). Residual-stream geometry encodes biological structure complementary to attention patterns. These results indicate that biological transformers learn an interpretable internal model of cellular organization, with implications for regulatory network inference, drug target prioritization, and model auditing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Deep Accurate Solver for the Geodesic Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common approach to compute distances on continuous surfaces is by considering a discretized polygonal mesh approximating the surface and estimating distances on the polygon. We show that exact geodesic distances restricted to the polygon are at most second-order accurate with respect to the distances on the corresponding continuous surface. By order of accuracy we refer to the convergence rate as a function of the average distance between sampled points. Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface. We supply numerical evidence that the proposed learned update scheme provides better accuracy compared to the best possible polyhedral approximations and previous learning-based methods. The result is a third-order accurate solver with a bootstrapping-recipe for further improvement.</description>

      <title>RETLLM: Training and Data-Free MLLMs for Multimodal Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal information retrieval (MMIR) has gained attention for its flexibility in handling text, images, or mixed queries and candidates. Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) boost MMIR performance by incorporating MLLM knowledge under the contrastive finetuning framework. However, they suffer from pre-training inconsistency and require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, RetLLM, designed to query MLLMs for MMIR in a training- and data-free manner. Specifically, we formulate MMIR as a similarity score generation task and prompt MLLMs to directly predict retrieval scores in a coarse-then-fine pipeline. At the coarse stage, a top-k filtering strategy builds a small yet high-quality candidate pool for each query, enabling MLLMs to focus on semantically relevant candidates. Subsequently, the retrieval score is predicted by feeding both the query and candidate into MLLMs at the fine stage. Importantly, we propose a visual enhancement module during reasoning to help MLLMs re-pick forgotten visuals, improving retrieval. Extensive experiments on MMIR benchmarks show that RetLLM outperforms fine-tuned models. Ablation studies further verify each component. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve strong MMIR performance without any training, highlighting their inherent multimodal reasoning ability in a simple, scalable framework. We release our code at: https://github.com/alivecat05/RETLLM</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Truncation of Unbounded Data via Public Second Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data privacy is important in the AI era, and differential privacy (DP) is one of the golden solutions. However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.</description>

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.</description>

      <title>What Topological and Geometric Structure Do Biological Foundation Models Learn? Evidence from 141 Hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When biological foundation models such as scGPT and Geneformer process single-cell gene expression, what geometric and topological structure forms in their internal representations? Is that structure biologically meaningful or a training artifact, and how confident should we be in such claims? We address these questions through autonomous large-scale hypothesis screening: an AI-driven executor-brainstormer loop that proposed, tested, and refined 141 geometric and topological hypotheses across 52 iterations, covering persistent homology, manifold distances, cross-model alignment, community structure, and directed topology, all with explicit null controls and disjoint gene-pool splits.
  Three principal findings emerge. First, the models learn genuine geometric structure. Gene embedding neighborhoods exhibit non-trivial topology, with persistent homology significant in 11 of 12 transformer layers at p &lt; 0.05 in the weakest domain and 12 of 12 in the other two. A multi-level distance hierarchy shows that manifold-aware metrics outperform Euclidean distance for identifying regulatory gene pairs, and graph community partitions track known transcription factor target relationships. Second, this structure is shared across independently trained models. CCA alignment between scGPT and Geneformer yields canonical correlation of 0.80 and gene retrieval accuracy of 72 percent, yet none of 19 tested methods reliably recover gene-level correspondences. The models agree on the global shape of gene space but not on precise gene placement. Third, the structure is more localized than it first appears. Under stringent null controls applied across all null families, robust signal concentrates in immune tissue, while lung and external lung signals weaken substantially.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Hook: A Multimodal LLM Framework for Analyzing the Hooking Period of Video Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-based ads are a vital medium for brands to engage consumers, with social media platforms leveraging user data to optimize ad delivery and boost engagement. A crucial but under-explored aspect is the 'hooking period', the first three seconds that capture viewer attention and influence engagement metrics. Analyzing this brief window is challenging due to the multimodal nature of video content, which blends visual, auditory, and textual elements. Traditional methods often miss the nuanced interplay of these components, requiring advanced frameworks for thorough evaluation.
  This study presents a framework using transformer-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze the hooking period of video ads. It tests two frame sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and key frame selection, to ensure balanced and representative acoustic feature extraction, capturing the full range of design elements. The hooking video is processed by state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate descriptive analyses of the ad's initial impact, which are distilled into coherent topics using BERTopic for high-level abstraction. The framework also integrates features such as audio attributes and aggregated ad targeting information, enriching the feature set for further analysis.
  Empirical validation on large-scale real-world data from social media platforms demonstrates the efficacy of our framework, revealing correlations between hooking period features and key performance metrics like conversion per investment. The results highlight the practical applicability and predictive power of the approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing video ad strategies. This study advances video ad analysis by providing a scalable methodology for understanding and enhancing the initial moments of video advertisements.</description>

      <title>Testable Learning of General Halfspaces under Massart Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of testably learning general Massart halfspaces under the Gaussian distribution. In the testable learning setting, the aim is the design of a tester-learner pair satisfying the following properties: (1) if the tester accepts, the learner outputs a hypothesis and a certificate that it achieves near-optimal error, and (2) it is highly unlikely that the tester rejects if the data satisfies the underlying assumptions. Our main result is the first testable learning algorithm for general halfspaces with Massart noise and Gaussian marginals. The complexity of our algorithm is $d^{\mathrm{polylog}(\min\{1/\gamma, 1/\epsilon \})}$, where $\epsilon$ is the excess error and $\gamma$ is the bias of the target halfspace, which qualitatively matches the known quasi-polynomial Statistical Query lower bound for the non-testable setting. The analysis of our algorithm hinges on a novel sandwiching polynomial approximation to the sign function with multiplicative error that may be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>Causality $\neq$ Invariance: Function and Concept Vectors in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) represent concepts abstractly, i.e., independent of input format? We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance.</description>

      <title>SimpleOCR: Rendering Visualized Questions to Teach MLLMs to Read</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a critical question regarding their visual grounding mechanism remains unanswered: do these models genuinely ``read'' text embedded in images, or do they merely rely on parametric shortcuts in the text prompt? In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements. Code is available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/SimpleOCR.</description>

      <title>TopoEdit: Fast Post-Optimization Editing of Topology Optimized Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite topology optimization producing high-performance structures, late-stage localized revisions remain brittle: direct density-space edits (e.g., warping pixels, inserting holes, swapping infill) can sever load paths and sharply degrade compliance, while re-running optimization is slow and may drift toward a qualitatively different design. We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps. Across diverse case studies and large edit sweeps, TopoEdit produces intention-aligned modifications that better preserve mechanical performance and avoid catastrophic failure modes compared to direct density-space edits, while generating edited candidates in sub-second diffusion time per sample.</description>

      <title>mmWave Radar Aware Dual-Conditioned GAN for Speech Reconstruction of Signals With Low SNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar captures are band-limited and noisy, making for difficult reconstruction of intelligible full-bandwidth speech. In this work, we propose a two-stage speech reconstruction pipeline for mmWave using a Radar-Aware Dual-conditioned Generative Adversarial Network (RAD-GAN), which is capable of performing bandwidth extension on signals with low signal-to-noise ratios (-5 dB to -1 dB), captured through glass walls. We propose an mmWave-tailored Multi-Mel Discriminator (MMD) and a Residual Fusion Gate (RFG) to enhance the generator input to process multiple conditioning channels. The proposed two-stage pipeline involves pretraining the model on synthetically clipped clean speech and finetuning on fused mel spectrograms generated by the RFG. We empirically show that the proposed method, trained on a limited dataset, with no pre-trained modules, and no data augmentations, outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for this specific task. Audio examples of RAD-GAN are available online at https://rad-gan-demo-site.vercel.app/.</description>

      <title>LoBoost: Fast Model-Native Local Conformal Prediction for Gradient-Boosted Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-boosted decision trees are among the strongest off-the-shelf predictors for tabular regression, but point predictions alone do not quantify uncertainty. Conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage, yet split conformal uses a single global residual quantile and can be poorly adaptive under heteroscedasticity. Methods that improve adaptivity typically fit auxiliary nuisance models or introduce additional data splits/partitions to learn the conformal score, increasing cost and reducing data efficiency. We propose LoBoost, a model-native local conformal method that reuses the fitted ensemble's leaf structure to define multiscale calibration groups. Each input is encoded by its sequence of visited leaves; at resolution level k, we group points by matching prefixes of leaf indices across the first k trees and calibrate residual quantiles within each group. LoBoost requires no retraining, auxiliary models, or extra splitting beyond the standard train/calibration split. Experiments show competitive interval quality, improved test MSE on most datasets, and large calibration speedups.</description>

      <title>GetBatch: Distributed Multi-Object Retrieval for ML Data Loading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning training pipelines consume data in batches. A single training step may require thousands of samples drawn from shards distributed across a storage cluster. Issuing thousands of individual GET requests incurs per-request overhead that often dominates data transfer time. To solve this problem, we introduce GetBatch - a new object store API that elevates batch retrieval to a first-class storage operation, replacing independent GET operations with a single deterministic, fault-tolerant streaming execution. GetBatch achieves up to 15x throughput improvement for small objects and, in a production training workload, reduces P95 batch retrieval latency by 2x and P99 per-object tail latency by 3.7x compared to individual GET requests.</description>

      <title>veScale-FSDP: Flexible and High-Performance FSDP at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), also known as ZeRO, is widely used for training large-scale models, featuring its flexibility and minimal intrusion on model code. However, current FSDP systems struggle with structure-aware training methods (e.g., block-wise quantized training) and with non-element-wise optimizers (e.g., Shampoo and Muon) used in cutting-edge models (e.g., Gemini, Kimi K2). FSDP's fixed element- or row-wise sharding formats conflict with the block-structured computations. In addition, today's implementations fall short in communication and memory efficiency, limiting scaling to tens of thousands of GPUs. We introduce veScale-FSDP, a redesigned FSDP system that couples a flexible sharding format, RaggedShard, with a structure-aware planning algorithm to deliver both flexibility and performance at scale. veScale-FSDP natively supports efficient data placement required by FSDP, empowering block-wise quantization and non-element-wise optimizers. As a result, veScale-FSDP achieves 5~66% higher throughput and 16~30% lower memory usage than existing FSDP systems, while scaling efficiently to tens of thousands of GPUs.</description>

      <title>How Do Latent Reasoning Methods Perform Under Weak and Strong Supervision?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.</description>

      <title>A Fusion of context-aware based BanglaBERT and Two-Layer Stacked LSTM Framework for Multi-Label Cyberbullying Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing concern in todays virtual world. When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture.</description>

      <title>When to Act, Ask, or Learn: Uncertainty-Aware Policy Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy steering is an emerging way to adapt robot behaviors at deployment-time: a learned verifier analyzes low-level action samples proposed by a pre-trained policy (e.g., diffusion policy) and selects only those aligned with the task. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task. We leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the composition of the VLM and the pre-trained base policy, providing statistical assurances that the verifier selects the correct strategy. After collecting interventions during deployment, we employ residual learning to improve the capability of the pre-trained policy, enabling the system to learn continually but with minimal expensive human feedback. We demonstrate our framework through experiments in simulation and on hardware, showing that UPS can disentangle confident, ambiguous, and incapable scenarios and minimizes expensive user interventions compared to uncalibrated baselines and prior human- or robot-gated continual learning approaches.

      <title>VeRO: An Evaluation Harness for Agents to Optimize Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a simulation-free alternative to diffusion-based generative modeling, producing samples by solving an ODE whose time-dependent velocity field is learned along an interpolation between a simple source distribution (e.g., a standard normal) and a target data distribution. Flow-based methods often exhibit greater training stability and have achieved strong empirical performance in high-dimensional settings where data concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold, such as text-to-image synthesis, video generation, and molecular structure generation. Despite this success, existing theoretical analyses of flow matching assume target distributions with smooth, full-dimensional densities, leaving its effectiveness in manifold-supported settings largely unexplained. To this end, we theoretically analyze flow matching with linear interpolation when the target distribution is supported on a smooth manifold. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the learned velocity field, and then propagate this estimation error through the ODE to obtain statistical consistency of the implicit density estimator induced by the flow-matching objective. The resulting convergence rate is near minimax-optimal, depends only on the intrinsic dimension, and reflects the smoothness of both the manifold and the target distribution. Together, these results provide a principled explanation for how flow matching adapts to intrinsic data geometry and circumvents the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>From Shallow Bayesian Neural Networks to Gaussian Processes: General Convergence, Identifiability and Scalable Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study scaling limits of shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) via their connection to Gaussian processes (GPs), with an emphasis on statistical modeling, identifiability, and scalable inference. We first establish a general convergence result from BNNs to GPs by relaxing assumptions used in prior formulations, and we compare alternative parameterizations of the limiting GP model. Building on this theory, we propose a new covariance function defined as a convex mixture of components induced by four widely used activation functions, and we characterize key properties including positive definiteness and both strict and practical identifiability under different input designs. For computation, we develop a scalable maximum a posterior (MAP) training and prediction procedure using a Nystr\"om approximation, and we show how the Nystr\"om rank and anchor selection control the cost-accuracy trade-off. Experiments on controlled simulations and real-world tabular datasets demonstrate stable hyperparameter estimates and competitive predictive performance at realistic computational cost.</description>

      <title>TFPS: A Temporal Filtration-enhanced Positive Sample Set Construction Method for Implicit Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negative sampling strategy can effectively train collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation models based on implicit feedback by constructing positive and negative samples. However, existing methods primarily optimize the negative sampling process while neglecting the exploration of positive samples. Some denoising recommendation methods can be applied to denoise positive samples within negative sampling strategies, but they ignore temporal information. Existing work integrates sequential information during model aggregation but neglects time interval information, hindering accurate capture of users' current preferences. To address this problem, from a data perspective, we propose a novel temporal filtration-enhanced approach to construct a high-quality positive sample set. First, we design a time decay model based on interaction time intervals, transforming the original graph into a weighted user-item bipartite graph. Then, based on predefined filtering operations, the weighted user-item bipartite graph is layered. Finally, we design a layer-enhancement strategy to construct a high-quality positive sample set for the layered subgraphs. We provide theoretical insights into why TFPS can improve Recall@k and NDCG@k, and extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, TFPS can be integrated with various implicit CF recommenders or negative sampling methods to enhance its performance.</description>

      <title>A Synergistic Approach: Dynamics-AI Ensemble in Tropical Cyclone Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in AI-based weather forecasting by developing an AI-driven optimized ensemble forecast system using Orthogonal Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbations (O-CNOPs). The system bridges the gap between computational efficiency and dynamic consistency in tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting. Unlike conventional ensembles limited by computational costs or AI ensembles constrained by inadequate perturbation methods, O-CNOPs generate dynamically optimized perturbations that capture fast-growing errors of FuXi model while maintaining plausibility. The key innovation lies in producing orthogonal perturbations that respect FuXi nonlinear dynamics, yielding structures reflecting dominant dynamical controls and physically interpretable probabilistic forecasts. Demonstrating superior deterministic and probabilistic skills over the operational Integrated Forecasting System Ensemble Prediction System, this work establishes a new paradigm combining AI computational advantages with rigorous dynamical constraints. Success in TC track forecasting paves the way for reliable ensemble forecasts of other high-impact weather systems, marking a major step toward operational AI-based ensemble forecasting.</description>

      <title>HARU-Net: Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net for Edge-Preserving Denoising in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dental and maxillofacial imaging, but low-dose acquisition introduces strong, spatially varying noise that degrades soft-tissue visibility and obscures fine anatomical structures. Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084). This effective and clinically reliable CBCT denoising is achieved at a computational cost significantly lower than that of the SOTA methods, offering a practical advancement toward improving diagnostic quality in low-dose CBCT imaging.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Dense Retrieval with Routing Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \textit{de facto} paradigm for applying dense retrieval (DR) to new tasks involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a specific task. However, this paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) It is difficult adapt the DR to a new domain if the training dataset is limited.
  (2) Old DR models are simply replaced by newer models that are trained from scratch when the former are no longer up to date. Especially for scenarios where the model needs to be updated frequently, this paradigm is prohibitively expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dense retrieval approach, termed \textit{dynamic dense retrieval} (DDR). DDR uses \textit{prefix tuning} as a \textit{module} specialized for a specific domain. These modules can then be compositional combined with a dynamic routing strategy, enabling highly flexible domain adaptation in the retrieval part. Extensive evaluation on six zero-shot downstream tasks demonstrates that this approach can surpass DR while utilizing only 2\% of the training parameters, paving the way to achieve more flexible dense retrieval in IR. We see it as a promising future direction for applying dense retrieval to various tasks.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Practical Column Generation Approach for Identifying Carcinogenic Multi-Hit Gene Combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer is often driven by specific combinations of an estimated two to nine gene mutations, known as multi-hit combinations. Identifying these combinations is critical for understanding carcinogenesis and designing targeted therapies. We formalise this challenge as the Multi-Hit Cancer Driver Set Cover Problem (MHCDSCP), a binary classification problem that selects gene combinations to maximise coverage of tumor samples while minimising coverage of normal samples. Existing approaches typically rely on exhaustive search and supercomputing infrastructure. In this paper, we present constraint programming and mixed integer programming formulations of the MHCDSCP. Evaluated on real-world cancer genomics data, our methods achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while running on a single commodity CPU in under a minute. Furthermore, we introduce a column generation heuristic capable of solving small instances to optimality. These results suggest that solving the MHCDSCP is less computationally intensive than previously believed, thereby opening research directions for exploring modelling assumptions.</description>

      <title>CourtGuard: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Zero-Shot Policy Adaptation in LLM Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current safety mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on static, fine-tuned classifiers that suffer from adaptation rigidity, the inability to enforce new governance rules without expensive retraining. To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks. Our results demonstrate that decoupling safety logic from model weights offers a robust, interpretable, and adaptable path for meeting current and future regulatory requirements in AI governance.</description>

      <title>Search-P1: Path-Centric Reward Shaping for Stable and Efficient Agentic RAG Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge, yet traditional single-round retrieval struggles with complex multi-step reasoning. Agentic RAG addresses this by enabling LLMs to dynamically decide when and what to retrieve, but current RL-based training methods suffer from sparse outcome rewards that discard intermediate signals and low sample efficiency where failed samples contribute nothing. We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that Search-P1 achieves significant improvements over Search-R1 and other strong baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 7.7 points.</description>

      <title>Correcting Human Labels for Rater Effects in AI Evaluation: An Item Response Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.</description>

      <title>SideQuest: Model-Driven KV Cache Management for Long-Horizon Agentic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.</description>

      <title>EvolveGen: Algorithmic Level Hardware Model Checking Benchmark Generation through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in hardware model checking depends critically on high-quality benchmarks. However, the community faces a significant benchmark gap: existing suites are limited in number, often distributed only in representations such as BTOR2 without access to the originating register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and biased toward extreme difficulty where instances are either trivial or intractable. These limitations hinder rigorous evaluation of new verification techniques and encourage overfitting of solver heuristics to a narrow set of problems. To address this, we introduce EvolveGen, a framework for generating hardware model checking benchmarks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with high-level synthesis (HLS). Our approach operates at an algorithmic level of abstraction in which an RL agent learns to construct computation graphs. By compiling these graphs under different synthesis directives, we produce pairs of functionally equivalent but structurally distinct hardware designs, inducing challenging model checking instances. Solver runtime is used as the reward signal, enabling the agent to autonomously discover and generate small-but-hard instances that expose solver-specific weaknesses. Experiments show that EvolveGen efficiently creates a diverse benchmark set in standard formats (e.g., AIGER and BTOR2) and effectively reveals performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art model checkers.</description>

      <title>Advancing accelerator virtual beam diagnostics through latent evolution modeling: an integrated solution to forward, inverse, tuning, and UQ problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual beam diagnostics relies on computationally intensive beam dynamics simulations where high-dimensional charged particle beams evolve through the accelerator. We propose Latent Evolution Model (LEM), a hybrid machine learning framework with an autoencoder that projects high-dimensional phase spaces into lower-dimensional representations, coupled with transformers to learn temporal dynamics in the latent space. This approach provides a common foundational framework addressing multiple interconnected challenges in beam diagnostics. For \textit{forward modeling}, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) encodes 15 unique projections of the 6D phase space into a latent representation, while a transformer predicts downstream latent states from upstream inputs. For \textit{inverse problems}, we address two distinct challenges: (a) predicting upstream phase spaces from downstream observations by utilizing the same CVAE architecture with transformers trained on reversed temporal sequences along with aleatoric uncertainty quantification, and (b) estimating RF settings from the latent space of the trained LEM using a dedicated dense neural network that maps latent representations to RF parameters. For \textit{tuning problems}, we leverage the trained LEM and RF estimator within a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal RF settings that minimize beam loss. This paper summarizes our recent efforts and demonstrates how this unified approach effectively addresses these traditionally separate challenges.</description>

      <title>HyperKKL: Enabling Non-Autonomous State Estimation through Dynamic Weight Conditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes HyperKKL, a novel learning approach for designing Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observers for non-autonomous nonlinear systems. While KKL observers offer a rigorous theoretical framework by immersing nonlinear dynamics into a stable linear latent space, its practical realization relies on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that are analytically intractable. Current existing learning-based approximations of the KKL observer are mostly designed for autonomous systems, failing to generalize to driven dynamics without expensive retraining or online gradient updates. HyperKKL addresses this by employing a hypernetwork architecture that encodes the exogenous input signal to instantaneously generate the parameters of the KKL observer, effectively learning a family of immersion maps parameterized by the external drive. We rigorously evaluate this approach against a curriculum learning strategy that attempts to generalize from autonomous regimes via training heuristics alone. The novel approach is illustrated on four numerical simulations in benchmark examples including the Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and R\"ossler systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly deployed in safety- and mission-critical pipelines, yet many verification and analysis results are produced outside the programming environment that defines and runs the model. This separation creates a semantic gap between the executed network and the analyzed artifact, so guarantees can hinge on implicit conventions such as operator semantics, tensor layouts, preprocessing, and floating-point corner cases. We introduce TorchLean, a framework in the Lean 4 theorem prover that treats learned models as first-class mathematical objects with a single, precise semantics shared by execution and verification. TorchLean unifies (1) a PyTorch-style verified API with eager and compiled modes that lower to a shared op-tagged SSA/DAG computation-graph IR, (2) explicit Float32 semantics via an executable IEEE-754 binary32 kernel and proof-relevant rounding models, and (3) verification via IBP and CROWN/LiRPA-style bound propagation with certificate checking. We validate TorchLean end-to-end on certified robustness, physics-informed residual bounds for PINNs, and Lyapunov-style neural controller verification, alongside mechanized theoretical results including a universal approximation theorem. These results demonstrate a semantics-first infrastructure for fully formal, end-to-end verification of learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Vectorizing the Trie: Efficient Constrained Decoding for LLM-based Generative Retrieval on Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/youtube/static-constraint-decoding.</description>

      <title>dLLM: Simple Diffusion Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.
  To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.</description>

      <title>DPSQL+: A Differentially Private SQL Library with a Minimum Frequency Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SQL is the de facto interface for exploratory data analysis; however, releasing exact query results can expose sensitive information through membership or attribute inference attacks. Differential privacy (DP) provides rigorous privacy guarantees, but in practice, DP alone may not satisfy governance requirements such as the \emph{minimum frequency rule}, which requires each released group (cell) to include contributions from at least $k$ distinct individuals. In this paper, we present \textbf{DPSQL+}, a privacy-preserving SQL library that simultaneously enforces user-level $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and the minimum frequency rule. DPSQL+ adopts a modular architecture consisting of: (i) a \emph{Validator} that statically restricts queries to a DP-safe subset of SQL; (ii) an \emph{Accountant} that consistently tracks cumulative privacy loss across multiple queries; and (iii) a \emph{Backend} that interfaces with various database engines, ensuring portability and extensibility. Experiments on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that DPSQL+ achieves practical accuracy across a wide range of analytical workloads -- from basic aggregates to quadratic statistics and join operations -- and allows substantially more queries under a fixed global privacy budget than prior libraries in our evaluation.</description>

      <title>Generative Recommendation for Large-Scale Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently attracted widespread attention in industry due to its potential for scaling and stronger model capacity. However, deploying real-time generative recommendation in large-scale advertising requires designs beyond large-language-model (LLM)-style training and serving recipes. We present a production-oriented generative recommender co-designed across architecture, learning, and serving, named GR4AD (Generative Recommendation for ADdvertising). As for tokenization, GR4AD proposes UA-SID (Unified Advertisement Semantic ID) to capture complicated business information. Furthermore, GR4AD introduces LazyAR, a lazy autoregressive decoder that relaxes layer-wise dependencies for short, multi-candidate generation, preserving effectiveness while reducing inference cost, which facilitates scaling under fixed serving budgets. To align optimization with business value, GR4AD employs VSL (Value-Aware Supervised Learning) and proposes RSPO (Ranking-Guided Softmax Preference Optimization), a ranking-aware, list-wise reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes value-based rewards under list-level metrics for continual online updates. For online inference, we further propose dynamic beam serving, which adapts beam width across generation levels and online load to control compute. Large-scale online A/B tests show up to 4.2% ad revenue improvement over an existing DLRM-based stack, with consistent gains from both model scaling and inference-time scaling. GR4AD has been fully deployed in Kuaishou advertising system with over 400 million users and achieves high-throughput real-time serving.</description>

      <title>AMA-Bench: Evaluating Long-Horizon Memory for Agentic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.</description>

      <title>QSIM: Mitigating Overestimation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Action Similarity Weighted Q-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Diffusion Models for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for decision-making tasks in robotics, and more recently, are also being considered for solving autonomous driving tasks. However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings. The full strength of diffusion models for large-scale, complex real-world settings, such as End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E AD), remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model. Our work demonstrates that diffusion models, when properly designed and trained, can serve as effective and scalable E2E AD planners for complex, real-world autonomous driving tasks.</description>

      <title>FlexMS is a flexible framework for benchmarking deep learning-based mass spectrum prediction tools in metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.</description>

      <title>TARAZ: Persian Short-Answer Question Benchmark for Cultural Evaluation of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the cultural competence of large language models (LLMs) in Persian. Existing Persian cultural benchmarks rely predominantly on multiple-choice formats and English-centric metrics that fail to capture Persian's morphological complexity and semantic nuance. Our framework introduces a Persian-specific short-answer evaluation that combines rule-based morphological normalization with a hybrid syntactic and semantic similarity module, enabling robust soft-match scoring beyond exact string overlap. Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect. We publicly release our evaluation framework, providing the first standardized benchmark for measuring cultural understanding in Persian and establishing a reproducible foundation for cross-cultural LLM evaluation research.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Continual Learning for Amortized Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) enables efficient posterior estimation using generative neural networks trained on simulated data, but often suffers from performance degradation under model misspecification. While self-consistency (SC) training on unlabeled empirical data can enhance network robustness, current approaches are limited to static, single-task settings and fail to handle sequentially arriving data or distribution shifts. We propose a continual learning framework for ABI that decouples simulation-based pre-training from unsupervised sequential SC fine-tuning on real-world data. To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, we introduce two adaptation strategies: (1) SC with episodic replay, utilizing a memory buffer of past observations, and (2) SC with elastic weight consolidation, which regularizes updates to preserve task-critical parameters. Across three diverse case studies, our methods significantly mitigate forgetting and yield posterior estimates that outperform standard simulation-based training, achieving estimates closer to MCMC reference, providing a viable path for trustworthy ABI across a range of different tasks.</description>

      <title>SPD Learn: A Geometric Deep Learning Python Library for Neural Decoding Through Trivialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementations of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix-based neural networks for neural decoding remain fragmented across research codebases and Python packages. Existing implementations often employ ad hoc handling of manifold constraints and non-unified training setups, which hinders reproducibility and integration into modern deep-learning workflows. To address this gap, we introduce SPD Learn, a unified and modular Python package for geometric deep learning with SPD matrices. SPD Learn provides core SPD operators and neural-network layers, including numerically stable spectral operators, and enforces Stiefel/SPD constraints via trivialization-based parameterizations. This design enables standard backpropagation and optimization in unconstrained Euclidean spaces while producing manifold-constrained parameters by construction. The package also offers reference implementations of representative SPDNet-based models and interfaces with widely used brain computer interface/neuroimaging toolkits and modern machine-learning libraries (e.g., MOABB, Braindecode, Nilearn, and SKADA), facilitating reproducible benchmarking and practical deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PSQE: A Theoretical-Practical Approach to Pseudo Seed Quality Enhancement for Unsupervised MMEA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across different data modalities, enabling structural data integration that in turn improves the performance of various large language model applications. To lift the requirement of labeled seed pairs that are difficult to obtain, recent methods shifted to an unsupervised paradigm using pseudo-alignment seeds. However, unsupervised entity alignment in multimodal settings remains underexplored, mainly because the incorporation of multimodal information often results in imbalanced coverage of pseudo-seeds within the knowledge graph. To overcome this, we propose PSQE (Pseudo-Seed Quality Enhancement) to improve the precision and graph coverage balance of pseudo seeds via multimodal information and clustering-resampling. Theoretical analysis reveals the impact of pseudo seeds on existing contrastive learning-based MMEA models. In particular, pseudo seeds can influence the attraction and the repulsion terms in contrastive learning at once, whereas imbalanced graph coverage causes models to prioritize high-density regions, thereby weakening their learning capability for entities in sparse regions. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings and show that PSQE as a plug-and-play module can improve the performance of baselines by considerable margins.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: A Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models, generative recommendation is gradually reshaping the paradigm of recommender systems. However, most existing methods are still confined to the interaction-driven next-item prediction paradigm, failing to rapidly adapt to evolving trends or address diverse recommendation tasks along with business-specific requirements in real-world scenarios. To this end, we present SIGMA, a Semantic-Grounded Instruction-Driven Generative Multi-Task Recommender at AliExpress. Specifically, we first ground item entities in general semantics via a unified latent space capturing both semantic and collaborative relations. Building upon this, we develop a hybrid item tokenization method for precise modeling and efficient generation. Moreover, we construct a large-scale multi-task SFT dataset to empower SIGMA to fulfill various recommendation demands via instruction-following. Finally, we design a three-step item generation procedure integrated with an adaptive probabilistic fusion mechanism to calibrate the output distributions based on task-specific requirements for recommendation accuracy and diversity. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGMA.</description>

      <title>Beyond NNGP: Large Deviations and Feature Learning in Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wide Bayesian neural networks focusing on the rare but statistically dominant fluctuations that govern posterior concentration, beyond Gaussian-process limits. Large-deviation theory provides explicit variational objectives-rate functions-on predictors, providing an emerging notion of complexity and feature learning directly at the functional level. We show that the posterior output rate function is obtained by a joint optimization over predictors and internal kernels, in contrast with fixed-kernel (NNGP) theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting predictions accurately describe finite-width behavior for moderately sized networks, capturing non-Gaussian tails, posterior deformation, and data-dependent kernel selection effects.</description>

      <title>pMoE: Prompting Diverse Experts Together Wins More in Visual Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Kernel Integrated $R^2$: A Measure of Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce kernel integrated $R^2$, a new measure of statistical dependence that combines the local normalization principle of the recently introduced integrated $R^2$ with the flexibility of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed measure extends integrated $R^2$ from scalar responses to responses taking values on general spaces equipped with a characteristic kernel, allowing to measure dependence of multivariate, functional, and structured data, while remaining sensitive to tail behaviour and oscillatory dependence structures. We establish that (i) this new measure takes values in $[0,1]$, (ii) equals zero if and only if independence holds, and (iii) equals one if and only if the response is almost surely a measurable function of the covariates. Two estimators are proposed: a graph-based method using $K$-nearest neighbours and an RKHS-based method built on conditional mean embeddings. We prove consistency and derive convergence rates for the graph-based estimator, showing its adaptation to intrinsic dimensionality. Numerical experiments on simulated data and a real data experiment in the context of dependency testing for media annotations demonstrate competitive power against state-of-the-art dependence measures, particularly in settings involving non-linear and structured relationships.</description>

      <title>Regular Fourier Features for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating a Gaussian process requires sampling from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which scales cubically with the number of sample locations. Spectral methods address this challenge by exploiting the Fourier representation, treating the spectral density as a probability distribution for Monte Carlo approximation. Although this probabilistic interpretation works for stationary processes, it is overly restrictive for the nonstationary case, where spectral densities are generally not probability measures. We propose regular Fourier features for harmonizable processes that avoid this limitation. Our method discretizes the spectral representation directly, preserving the correlation structure among spectral weights without requiring probability assumptions. Under a finite spectral support assumption, this yields an efficient low-rank approximation that is positive semi-definite by construction. When the spectral density is unknown, the framework extends naturally to kernel learning from data. We demonstrate the method on locally stationary kernels and on harmonizable mixture kernels with complex-valued spectral densities.</description>

      <title>Sequential Regression for Continuous Value Prediction using Residual Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous value prediction plays a crucial role in industrial-scale recommendation systems, including tasks such as predicting users' watch-time and estimating the gross merchandise value (GMV) in e-commerce transactions. However, it remains challenging due to the highly complex and long-tailed nature of the data distributions. Existing generative approaches rely on rigid parametric distribution assumptions, which fundamentally limits their performance when such assumptions misalign with real-world data. Overly simplified forms cannot adequately model real-world complexities, while more intricate assumptions often suffer from poor scalability and generalization.
  To address these challenges, we propose a residual quantization (RQ)-based sequence learning framework that represents target continuous values as a sum of ordered quantization codes, predicted recursively from coarse to fine granularity with diminishing quantization errors. We introduce a representation learning objective that aligns RQ code embedding space with the ordinal structure of target values, allowing the model to capture continuous representations for quantization codes and further improving prediction accuracy. We perform extensive evaluations on public benchmarks for lifetime value (LTV) and watch-time prediction, alongside a large-scale online experiment for GMV prediction on an industrial short-video recommendation platform. The results consistently show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while demonstrating strong generalization across diverse continuous value prediction tasks in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>SubspaceAD: Training-Free Few-Shot Anomaly Detection via Subspace Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/CLendering/SubspaceAD.</description>

      <title>Low-degree Lower bounds for clustering in moderate dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of clustering $n$ points into $K$ groups drawn from a mixture of isotropic Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $\Delta$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $\Delta$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a "non-parametric rate". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.</description>

      <title>MoDora: Tree-Based Semi-Structured Document Analysis System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.
  To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.</description>

      <title>Assessing Deanonymization Risks with Stylometry-Assisted LLM Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.</description>

      <title>Q-Tag: Watermarking Quantum Circuit Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms have become the most widely adopted and mainstream approach for accessing quantum computing resources, due to the scarcity and operational complexity of quantum hardware. In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design.</description>

      <title>From Agnostic to Specific: Latent Preference Diffusion for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to learn the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions of users' multi-behavior sequences, so as to capture user preferences under target behavior for the next interacted item prediction. Unlike previous methods that adopt unidirectional modeling by mapping auxiliary behaviors to target behavior, recent concerns are shifting from behavior-fixed to behavior-specific recommendation. However, these methods still ignore the user's latent preference that underlying decision-making, leading to suboptimal solutions. Meanwhile, due to the asymmetric deterministic between items and behaviors, discriminative paradigm based on preference scoring is unsuitable to capture the uncertainty from low-entropy behaviors to high-entropy items, failing to provide efficient and diverse recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{FatsMB}, a framework based diffusion model that guides preference generation \textit{\textbf{F}rom Behavior-\textbf{A}gnostic \textbf{T}o Behavior-\textbf{S}pecific} in latent spaces, enabling diverse and accurate \textit{\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{B}ehavior Sequential Recommendation}. Specifically, we design a Multi-Behavior AutoEncoder (MBAE) to construct a unified user latent preference space, facilitating interaction and collaboration across Behaviors, within Behavior-aware RoPE (BaRoPE) employed for multiple information fusion. Subsequently, we conduct target behavior-specific preference transfer in the latent space, enriching with informative priors. A Multi-Condition Guided Layer Normalization (MCGLN) is introduced for the denoising. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Modality Collapse as Mismatched Decoding: Information-Theoretic Limits of Multimodal LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.
  We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.</description>

      <title>SettleFL: Trustless and Scalable Reward Settlement Protocol for Federated Learning on Permissionless Blockchains (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open Federated Learning (FL) environments where no central authority exists, ensuring collaboration fairness relies on decentralized reward settlement, yet the prohibitive cost of permissionless blockchains directly clashes with the high-frequency, iterative nature of model training. Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-chain costs. To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination. We conduct extensive experiments combining real FL workloads and controlled simulations. Results show that SettleFL remains practical when scaling to 800 participants, achieving substantially lower gas cost.</description>

      <title>FairQuant: Fairness-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressing neural networks by quantizing model parameters offers useful trade-off between performance and efficiency. Methods like quantization-aware training and post-training quantization strive to maintain the downstream performance of compressed models compared to the full precision models. However, these techniques do not explicitly consider the impact on algorithmic fairness. In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT. Results show that FairQuant configurations with average precision near 4-6 bits recover much of the Uniform 8-bit accuracy while improving worst-group performance relative to Uniform 4- and 8-bit baselines, with comparable fairness metrics under shared budgets.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Without Forgetting In-Context Learning: A Theoretical Analysis of Linear Attention Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Diffusion Meets ADMM: Dual-Variable Coupling for Robust Medical Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.</description>

      <title>Scaling Search Relevance: Augmenting App Store Ranking with LLM-Generated Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale commercial search systems optimize for relevance to drive successful sessions that help users find what they are looking for. To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Stackelberg Control in Combinatorial Congestion Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg (leader--follower) tuning of network parameters (tolls, capacities, incentives) in combinatorial congestion games, where selfish users choose discrete routes (or other combinatorial strategies) and settle at a congestion equilibrium. The leader minimizes a system-level objective (e.g., total travel time) evaluated at equilibrium, but this objective is typically nonsmooth because the set of used strategies can change abruptly. We propose ZO-Stackelberg, which couples a projection-free Frank--Wolfe equilibrium solver with a zeroth-order outer update, avoiding differentiation through equilibria. We prove convergence to generalized Goldstein stationary points of the true equilibrium objective, with explicit dependence on the equilibrium approximation error, and analyze subsampled oracles: if an exact minimizer is sampled with probability $\kappa_m$, then the Frank--Wolfe error decays as $\mathcal{O}(1/(\kappa_m T))$. We also propose stratified sampling as a practical way to avoid a vanishing $\kappa_m$ when the strategies that matter most for the Wardrop equilibrium concentrate in a few dominant combinatorial classes (e.g., short paths). Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over a differentiation-based baseline while converging to follower equilibria.</description>

      <title>ManifoldGD: Training-Free Hierarchical Manifold Guidance for Diffusion-Based Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Zero-Shot and One-Shot Adaptation of Small Language Models in Leader-Follower Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.</description>

      <title>Deep ensemble graph neural networks for probabilistic cosmic-ray direction and energy reconstruction in autonomous radio arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a method for reconstructing precisely the arrival direction and energy of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from the voltage traces they induced on ground-based radio detector arrays.
  In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092{\deg} and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.
  We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</description>

      <title>Procedural Fairness in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has garnered significant attention. However, current research has mainly concentrated on the distributive fairness of ML models, with limited focus on another dimension of fairness, i.e., procedural fairness. In this paper, we first define the procedural fairness of ML models by drawing from the established understanding of procedural fairness in philosophy and psychology fields, and then give formal definitions of individual and group procedural fairness. Based on the proposed definition, we further propose a novel metric to evaluate the group procedural fairness of ML models, called $GPF_{FAE}$, which utilizes a widely used explainable artificial intelligence technique, namely feature attribution explanation (FAE), to capture the decision process of ML models. We validate the effectiveness of $GPF_{FAE}$ on a synthetic dataset and eight real-world datasets. Our experimental studies have revealed the relationship between procedural and distributive fairness of ML models. After validating the proposed metric for assessing the procedural fairness of ML models, we then propose a method for identifying the features that lead to the procedural unfairness of the model and propose two methods to improve procedural fairness based on the identified unfair features. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can accurately identify the features that lead to procedural unfairness in the ML model, and both of our proposed methods can significantly improve procedural fairness while also improving distributive fairness, with a slight sacrifice on the model performance.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Continual Learning: A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17120v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning for continual learning (PEFT-CL) has shown promise in adapting pre-trained models to sequential tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting problem. However, understanding the mechanisms that dictate continual performance in this paradigm remains elusive. To unravel this mystery, we undertake a rigorous analysis of PEFT-CL dynamics to derive relevant metrics for continual scenarios using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. With the aid of NTK as a mathematical analysis tool, we recast the challenge of test-time forgetting into the quantifiable generalization gaps during training, identifying three key factors that influence these gaps and the performance of PEFT-CL: training sample size, task-level feature orthogonality, and regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce NTK-CL, a novel framework that eliminates task-specific parameter storage while adaptively generating task-relevant features. Aligning with theoretical guidance, NTK-CL triples the feature representation of each sample, theoretically and empirically reducing the magnitude of both task-interplay and task-specific generalization gaps. Grounded in NTK analysis, our framework imposes an adaptive exponential moving average mechanism and constraints on task-level feature orthogonality, maintaining intra-task NTK forms while attenuating inter-task NTK forms. Ultimately, by fine-tuning optimizable parameters with appropriate regularization, NTK-CL achieves state-of-the-art performance on established PEFT-CL benchmarks. This work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving PEFT-CL models, offering insights into the interplay between feature representation, task orthogonality, and generalization, contributing to the development of more efficient continual learning systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems near algorithmic phase transitions represent a fundamental challenge for both classical algorithms and machine learning approaches. Among them, graph coloring stands as a prototypical constraint satisfaction problem exhibiting sharp dynamical and satisfiability thresholds. Here we introduce a physics-inspired neural framework that learns to solve large-scale graph coloring instances by combining graph neural networks with statistical-mechanics principles. Our approach integrates a planting-based supervised signal, symmetry-breaking regularization, and iterative noise-annealed neural dynamics to navigate clustered solution landscapes. When the number of iterations scales quadratically with graph size, the learned solver reaches algorithmic thresholds close to the theoretical dynamical transition in random graphs and achieves near-optimal detection performance in the planted inference regime. The model generalizes from small training graphs to instances orders of magnitude larger, demonstrating that neural architectures can learn scalable algorithmic strategies that remain effective in hard connectivity regions. These results establish a general paradigm for learning neural solvers that operate near fundamental phase boundaries in combinatorial optimization and inference.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Guaranteed Label Unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning: Few-Shot Forgetting without Disclosure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of unlearning in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), a setting that has received far less attention than its horizontal counterpart. Specifically, we propose the first method tailored to \textit{label unlearning} in VFL, where labels play a dual role as both essential inputs and sensitive information. To this end, we employ a representation-level manifold mixup mechanism to generate synthetic embeddings for both unlearned and retained samples. This is to provide richer signals for the subsequent gradient-based label forgetting and recovery steps. These augmented embeddings are then subjected to gradient-based label forgetting, effectively removing the associated label information from the model. To recover performance on the retained data, we introduce a recovery-phase optimization step that refines the remaining embeddings. This design achieves effective label unlearning while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ModelNet, Brain Tumor MRI, COVID-19 Radiography, and Yahoo Answers demonstrate strong efficacy and scalability. Overall, this work establishes a new direction for unlearning in VFL, showing that re-imagining mixup as an efficient mechanism can unlock practical and utility-preserving unlearning.

      <title>Beyond Attribution: Unified Concept-Level Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is an increasing need to integrate model-agnostic explanation techniques with concept-based approaches, as the former can explain models across different architectures while the latter makes explanations more faithful and understandable to end-users. However, existing concept-based model-agnostic explanation methods are limited in scope, mainly focusing on attribution-based explanations while neglecting diverse forms like sufficient conditions and counterfactuals, thus narrowing their utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a general framework UnCLE to elevate existing local model-agnostic techniques to provide concept-based explanations. Our key insight is that we can uniformly extend existing local model-agnostic methods to provide unified concept-based explanations with large pre-trained model perturbation. We have instantiated UnCLE to provide concept-based explanations in three forms: attributions, sufficient conditions, and counterfactuals, and applied it to popular text, image, and multimodal models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that UnCLE provides explanations more faithful than state-of-the-art concept-based explanation methods, and provides richer explanation forms that satisfy various user needs.</description>

Abstract: Few-step diffusion models enable efficient high-resolution image synthesis but struggle to align with specific downstream objectives due to limitations of existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in low-step regimes with limited state spaces and suboptimal sample quality. To address this, we propose Stepwise Diffusion Policy Optimization (SDPO), a novel RL framework tailored for few-step diffusion models. SDPO introduces a dual-state trajectory sampling mechanism, tracking both noisy and predicted clean states at each step to provide dense reward feedback and enable low-variance, mixed-step optimization. For further efficiency, we develop a latent similarity-based dense reward prediction strategy to minimize costly dense reward queries. Leveraging these dense rewards, SDPO optimizes a dense reward difference learning objective that enables more frequent and granular policy updates. Additional refinements, including stepwise advantage estimates, temporal importance weighting, and step-shuffled gradient updates, further enhance long-term dependency, low-step priority, and gradient stability. Our experiments demonstrate that SDPO consistently delivers superior reward-aligned results across diverse few-step settings and tasks.

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic AI for Analytical Solutions of Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analytical solutions to differential equations offer exact, interpretable insight but are rarely available because discovering them requires expert intuition or exhaustive search in combinatorial spaces. We introduce SIGS, a neuro-symbolic framework that automates this process. SIGS uses a formal grammar to generate only syntactically valid building blocks, embeds these expressions into a continuous space, and then searches this space to assemble, score, and refine candidate closed-form solutions by minimizing a physics-based residual. This design unifies symbolic reasoning with numerical optimization; the grammar constrains candidate solution blocks to be proper by construction, while the latent search makes exploration tractable and data-free. SIGS is the first neuro-symbolic method to (i) analytically solve coupled systems of nonlinear PDEs, (ii) discover solutions under grammar misspecification, and (iii) produce accurate symbolic approximations for PDEs lacking known closed-form solutions. Overall, SIGS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and efficiency over existing symbolic methods on standard benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards a Sharp Analysis of Offline Policy Learning for $f$-Divergence-Regularized Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many offline reinforcement learning algorithms are underpinned by $f$-divergence regularization, but their sample complexity *defined with respect to regularized objectives* still lacks tight analyses, especially in terms of concrete data coverage conditions. In this paper, we study the exact concentrability requirements to achieve the $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity for offline $f$-divergence-regularized contextual bandits. For reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, arguably the most commonly used one, we achieve an $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity under single-policy concentrability for the first time via a novel pessimism-based analysis, surpassing existing $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ bound under all-policy concentrability and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ bound under single-policy concentrability. We also propose a near-matching lower bound, demonstrating that a multiplicative dependency on single-policy concentrability is necessary to maximally exploit the curvature property of reverse KL. Moreover, for $f$-divergences with strongly convex $f$, to which reverse KL *does not* belong, we show that the sharp sample complexity $\tilde{\Theta}(\epsilon^{-1})$ is achievable even without pessimistic estimation or single-policy concentrability. We further corroborate our theoretical insights with numerical experiments and extend our analysis to contextual dueling bandits. We believe these results take a significant step towards a comprehensive understanding of objectives with $f$-divergence regularization.</description>

      <title>Mixing It Up: Exploring Mixer Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values (IMTS) is a fundamental challenge in domains such as healthcare, climate science, and biology. While recent advances in vision and time series forecasting have shown that lightweight MLP-based architectures (e.g., MLP-Mixer, TSMixer) can rival attention-based models in both accuracy and efficiency, their applicability to irregular and sparse time series remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose IMTS-Mixer, a novel architecture that adapts the principles of Mixer models to the IMTS setting. IMTS-Mixer introduces two key components: (1) ISCAM, a channel-wise encoder that transforms irregular observations into fixed-size vectors using simple MLPs, and (2) ConTP, a continuous time decoder that supports forecasting at arbitrary time points. In our experiments on established benchmark datasets we show that our model achieves state-of-the- art performance in both forecasting accuracy and inference time, while using fewer parameters compared to baselines.</description>

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG), a widely used axiomatic path-based attribution method, assigns importance scores to input features by integrating model gradients along a straight path from a baseline to the input. While effective in some cases, we show that straight paths can lead to flawed attributions. In this paper, we identify the cause of these misattributions and propose an alternative approach that equips the input space with a model-induced Riemannian metric (derived from the explained model's Jacobian) and computes attributions by integrating gradients along geodesics under this metric. We call this method Geodesic Integrated Gradients (GIG). To approximate geodesic paths, we introduce two techniques: a k-Nearest Neighbours-based approach for smaller models and a Stochastic Variational Inference-based method for larger ones. Additionally, we propose a new axiom, No-Cancellation Completeness (NCC), which strengthens completeness by ruling out feature-wise cancellation. We prove that, for path-based attributions under the model-induced metric, NCC holds if and only if the integration path is a geodesic. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world image classification data, we provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical analysis and showing that GIG produces more faithful attributions than existing methods, including IG, on the benchmarks considered.</description>

      <title>Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual learning algorithms aim to learn from a sequence of tasks. In order to avoid catastrophic forgetting, most existing approaches rely on heuristics and do not provide computable learning guarantees. In this paper, we introduce Continual Pick-to-Learn (CoP2L), a method grounded in sample compression theory that retains representative samples for each task in a principled and efficient way. This allows us to derive non-vacuous, numerically computable upper bounds on the generalization loss of the learned predictors after each task. We evaluate CoP2L on standard continual learning benchmarks under Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental settings, showing that it effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It turns out that CoP2L is empirically competitive with baseline methods while certifying predictor reliability in continual learning with a non-vacuous bound.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the regret-minimization algorithm for optimal design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting a subset of points from a dataset of $n$ unlabeled examples for labeling, with the goal of training a multiclass classifier. To address this, we build upon the regret minimization framework introduced by Allen-Zhu et al. in "Near-optimal design of experiments via regret minimization" (ICML, 2017). We propose an alternative regularization scheme within this framework, which leads to a new sample selection objective along with a provable sample complexity bound that guarantees a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution. Additionally, we extend the regret minimization approach to handle experimental design in the ridge regression setting. We evaluate the selected samples using logistic regression and compare performance against several state-of-the-art methods. Our empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and a 50-class subset of ImageNet demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms competing approaches across most scenarios.</description>

      <title>RaPA: Enhancing Transferable Targeted Attacks via Random Parameter Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to untargeted attacks, targeted transfer-based attack is still suffering from much lower Attack Success Rates (ASRs), although significant improvements have been achieved by kinds of methods, such as diversifying input, stabilizing the gradient, and re-training surrogate models. In this paper, we find that adversarial examples generated by existing methods rely heavily on a small subset of surrogate model parameters, which in turn limits their transferability to unseen target models. Inspired by this, we propose the Random Parameter Pruning Attack (RaPA), which introduces parameter-level randomization during the attack process. At each optimization step, RaPA randomly prunes model parameters to generate diverse yet semantically consistent surrogate variants.We show this parameter-level randomization is equivalent to adding an importance-equalization regularizer, thereby alleviating the over-reliance issue. Extensive experiments across both CNN and Transformer architectures demonstrate that RaPA substantially enhances transferability. In the challenging case of transferring from CNN-based to Transformer-based models, RaPA achieves up to 11.7% higher average ASRs than state-of-the-art baselines(with 33.3% ASRs), while being training-free, cross-architecture efficient, and easily integrated into existing attack frameworks.

      <title>Large Language Model Compression with Global Rank and Sparsity Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank and sparse composite approximation is a natural idea to compress Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such an idea faces two primary challenges that adversely affect the performance of existing methods. The first challenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and sparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across different layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the capability of global resource allocation for rank and sparsity. It is noteworthy that the overall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization computationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our first stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the weight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low dimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse matrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global allocation strategy to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures within the above two spaces. The appealing feature of our approach is its ability to automatically detect the redundancy across different layers and to manage the interaction between the sparse and low-rank components. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art techniques for sparsification and composite approximation.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction with Corrupted Labels: Uncertain Imputation and Robust Re-weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is valid.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery from Bivariate Continuous-Discrete Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the causal direction between a continuous variable $X$ and a discrete variable $Y$ from observational data. For the model $X \to Y$, we adopt the threshold model used in prior work. For the model $Y \to X$, we consider two cases: (1) the conditional distributions of $X$ given different values of $Y$ form a location-shift family, and (2) they are mixtures of generalized normal distributions with independently parameterized components. We establish identifiability of the causal direction through three theoretical results. First, we prove that under $X \to Y$, the density ratio of $X$ conditioned on different values of $Y$ is monotonic. Second, we establish that under $Y \to X$ with non-location-shift conditionals, monotonicity of the density ratio holds only on a set of Lebesgue measure zero in the parameter space. Third, we show that under $X \to Y$, the conditional distributions forming a location-shift family requires a precise coordination between the causal mechanism and input distribution, which is non-generic under the principle of independent mechanisms. Together, these results imply that monotonicity of the density ratio characterizes the direction $X \to Y$, whereas non-monotonicity or location-shift conditionals characterizes $Y \to X$. Based on this, we propose Density Ratio-based Causal Discovery (DRCD), a method that determines causal direction by testing for location-shift conditionals and monotonicity of the estimated density ratio. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DRCD outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>FrontierCO: Real-World and Large-Scale Evaluation of Machine Learning Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown promise for tackling combinatorial optimization (CO), but much of the reported progress relies on small-scale, synthetic benchmarks that fail to capture real-world structure and scale. A core limitation is that ML methods are typically trained and evaluated on synthetic instance generators, leaving open how they perform on irregular, competition-grade, or industrial datasets. We present FrontierCO, a benchmark for evaluating ML-based CO solvers under real-world structure and extreme scale. FrontierCO spans eight CO problems, including routing, scheduling, facility location, and graph problems, with instances drawn from competitions and public repositories (e.g., DIMACS, TSPLib). Each task provides both easy sets (historically challenging but now solvable) and hard sets (open or computationally intensive), alongside standardized training/validation resources. Using FrontierCO, we evaluate 16 representative ML solvers--graph neural approaches, hybrid neural-symbolic methods, and LLM-based agents--against state-of-the-art classical solvers. We find a persistent performance gap that widens under structurally challenging and large instance sizes (e.g., TSP up to 10M nodes; MIS up to 8M), while also identifying cases where ML methods outperform classical solvers. By centering evaluation on real-world structure and orders-of-magnitude larger instances, FrontierCO provides a rigorous basis for advancing ML for CO. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CO-Bench/FrontierCO.</description>

      <title>The Spacetime of Diffusion Models: An Information Geometry Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel geometric perspective on the latent space of diffusion models. We first show that the standard pullback approach, utilizing the deterministic probability flow ODE decoder, is fundamentally flawed. It provably forces geodesics to decode as straight segments in data space, effectively ignoring any intrinsic data geometry beyond the ambient Euclidean space. Complementing this view, diffusion also admits a stochastic decoder via the reverse SDE, which enables an information geometric treatment with the Fisher-Rao metric. However, a choice of $x_T$ as the latent representation collapses this metric due to memorylessness. We address this by introducing a latent spacetime $z=(x_t,t)$ that indexes the family of denoising distributions $p(x_0 | x_t)$ across all noise scales, yielding a nontrivial geometric structure. We prove these distributions form an exponential family and derive simulation-free estimators for curve lengths, enabling efficient geodesic computation. The resulting structure induces a principled Diffusion Edit Distance, where geodesics trace minimal sequences of noise and denoise edits between data. We also demonstrate benefits for transition path sampling in molecular systems, including constrained variants such as low-variance transitions and region avoidance.

      <title>On the Lipschitz Continuity of Set Aggregation Functions and Neural Networks for Sets</title>

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant of a neural network is connected to several important prop- erties of the network such as its robustness and generalization. It is thus useful in many settings to estimate the Lipschitz constant of a model. Prior work has fo- cused mainly on estimating the Lipschitz constant of multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Here we focus on data modeled as sets or multi- sets of vectors and on neural networks that can handle such data. These models typically apply some permutation invariant aggregation function, such as the sum, mean or max operator, to the input multisets to produce a single vector for each input sample. In this paper, we investigate whether these aggregation functions, along with an attention-based aggregation function, are Lipschitz continuous with respect to three distance functions for unordered multisets, and we compute their Lipschitz constants. In the general case, we find that each aggregation function is Lipschitz continuous with respect to only one of the three distance functions, while the attention-based function is not Lipschitz continuous with respect to any of them. Then, we build on these results to derive upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks that can process multisets of vectors, while we also study their stability to perturbations and generalization under distribution shifts. To empirically verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct a series of experiments on datasets from different domains.</description>

      <title>RL-Obfuscation: Can Language Models Learn to Evade Latent-Space Monitors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in Large Language Models by leveraging their internal representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions. However, these monitors may themselves become training signals, for example, by using problematic samples found in deployment to retrain models. This raises an important question: can models learn to evade such monitors? To evaluate this capability, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to evade latent-space monitors while maintaining their blackbox behaviour. We apply RL-Obfuscation to Language Models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate their Evasion Success Rate against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack while more holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, for these vulnerable monitors, models trained to evade a single static monitor can generalise to evade other unseen monitors. We also find that the models can be trained to conditionally bypass latent-space monitors on only certain inputs. Finally, we study how the models bypass these monitors and find that the model can learn to repurpose tokens to have different internal representations.</description>

      <title>Learning Task-Agnostic Motifs to Capture the Continuous Nature of Animal Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor motifs to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To better capture the continuous structure of behavior generation, we introduce motif-based continuous dynamics (MCD) discovery, a framework that (1) uncovers interpretable motif sets as latent basis functions of behavior by leveraging representations of behavioral transition structure, and (2) models behavioral dynamics as continuously evolving mixtures of these motifs. We validate MCD on a multi-task gridworld, a labyrinth navigation task, and freely moving animal behavior. Across settings, it identifies reusable motif components, captures continuous compositional dynamics, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete segmentation models. By providing a generative account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor motifs, our approach advances the quantitative study of natural behavior.</description>

      <title>Skewed Score: A statistical framework to assess autograders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity, or other factors. Here we propose a statistical framework based on Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to simultaneously assess their autograders while addressing their primary research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In addition, our method can be used to augment traditional metrics such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and clarifying sources of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling both performance analysis and bias detection.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Probabilistic Forecasting of Dynamical Systems using Flow Matching and Physical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems from incomplete or noisy data is inherently ill-posed, as a single observation may correspond to multiple plausible futures. While physics-based ensemble forecasting relies on perturbing initial states to capture uncertainty, standard Gaussian or uniform perturbations often yield unphysical initial states in high-dimensional systems. Existing machine learning approaches address this via diffusion models, which rely on inference via computationally expensive stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We introduce a novel framework that decouples perturbation generation from propagation. First, we propose a flow matching-based generative approach to learn physically consistent perturbations of the initial conditions, avoiding artifacts caused by Gaussian noise. Second, we employ deterministic flow matching models with Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) integrators for efficient ensemble propagation with fewer integration steps. We validate our method on nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, including the Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey system, MovingMNIST, and high-dimensional WeatherBench data (5.625$^\circ$). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic scoring, as measured by the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and physical consistency, while offering significantly faster inference than diffusion-based baselines.</description>

      <title>Zero-Variance Gradients for Variational Autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) requires propagating gradients through stochastic latent variables, which introduces estimation variance that can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction, which we call Silent Gradients. Instead of designing improved stochastic estimators, we show that by restricting the decoder architecture in specific ways, the expected ELBO can be computed analytically. This yields gradients with zero estimation variance as we can directly compute the evidence lower-bound without resorting to Monte Carlo samples of the latent variables. We first provide a theoretical analysis in a controlled setting with a linear decoder and demonstrate improved optimization compared to standard estimators. To extend this idea to expressive nonlinear decoders, we introduce a training paradigm that uses the analytic gradient to guide early encoder learning before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Across multiple datasets, our approach consistently improves established baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE. These results suggest that architectural choices enabling analytic expectation computation can significantly stabilize the training of generative models with stochastic components.</description>

      <title>Online time series prediction using feature adjustment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains. However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently, updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory-guided sparse PCA for single-cell RNA-seq data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences and technical factors, such as amplification bias and limited RNA capture efficiency, making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its interpretability and robustness, in spite of its known bias in high dimensions. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel biwhitening algorithm which self-consistently estimates the magnitude of transcriptomic noise affecting each gene in individual cells, without assuming a specific noise distribution. This enables the use of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-, autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Bayesian Optimization for Bilevel Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper- and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition, by which bilevel BO has not been widely studied compared with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint problems. We propose an information-theoretic approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously. Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through several benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Statistical Advantage of Softmax Attention: Insights from Single-Location Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from 86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide range of model sizes and quantization widths using the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Probes: Dynamic Safety Monitoring for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However, traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial: by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than their black-box counterparts.

      <title>Improving Discrete Diffusion Unmasking Policies Beyond Explicit Reference Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules (e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically, we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically, across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

      <title>Learning to Answer from Correct Demonstrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). We formalize the problem as imitation learning (i.e., apprenticeship learning) in contextual bandits, with offline demonstrations from some expert (optimal, or very good) policy, without explicitly observed rewards. In contrast to prior work, which assumes the demonstrator belongs to a bounded-complexity policy class, we propose relying only on the underlying reward model (i.e., specifying which answers are correct) being in a bounded-complexity class, which we argue is a strictly weaker assumption. We show that likelihood-maximization methods can fail in this setting, and instead present an approach that learns to answer nearly as well as the demonstrator, with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class. Our method is similar to Syed and Schapire 2007, when adapted to a contextual bandit (i.e., single step) setup, but is a simple one-pass online approach that enjoys an "optimistic rate" (i.e., $1/\varepsilon$ when the demonstrator is optimal, versus $1/\varepsilon^2$ in Syed and Schapire), and works even with arbitrarily adaptive demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Simplex-to-Euclidean Bijections for Categorical Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world data sets.</description>

      <title>UniQL: Unified Quantization and Low-rank Compression for Adaptive Edge LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on mobile platforms faces significant challenges due to the limited memory and shared computational resources of the device. Resource availability may be an issue as it is directly impacted by the current device workload, adding to the uncertainty of model deployment. We introduce UniQL, a unified post-training quantization and low-rank compression framework with on-device configurable pruning rates for edge LLMs. UniQL is a general framework that integrates quantization and low-rank compression for Transformers, State Space Models (SSMs), and hybrid models to support diverse edge applications. In our proposed joint framework, we introduce an efficient structured weight-sorting method that speeds up computation by 20x, quantization-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) to minimize quantization errors, state-aware weight sorting for SSMs, and a fused rotary positional embedding (RoPE) kernel for pruned models. Our framework performs weight-sorting, fine-tuning, and quantization in the cloud in a single-pass workflow, while enabling on-device configurable pruning rates up to 35%. Our experiments show that quantized and pruned models achieve a memory reduction of 4x-5.7x and a token-throughput improvement of 2.7x-3.4x, maintaining accuracy within 5% of the original models at 15% pruning across Transformers (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), SSMs (Mamba2), and hybrid models (Nemotron-H and Bamba-v2). The code and quantized models are available at: https://github.com/enyac-group/UniQL.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention Post-Training for Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 7B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.4 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. Additionally, using cross-layer transcoders, we show that sparse attention substantially simplifies attention attribution, enabling a unified view of feature-based and circuit-based perspectives. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.</description>

      <title>WebGym: Scaling Training Environments for Visual Web Agents with Realistic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02439v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.</description>

      <title>A Confidence-Variance Theory for Pseudo-Label Selection in Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most pseudo-label selection strategies in semi-supervised learning rely on fixed confidence thresholds, implicitly assuming that prediction confidence reliably indicates correctness. In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

      <title>Rethinking Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning: Optimizing the Interaction between Feature Alignment and Target Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting pre-trained models to unseen feature modalities has become increasingly important due to the growing need for cross-disciplinary knowledge integration. A key challenge here is how to align the representation of new modalities with the most relevant parts of the pre-trained model's representation space to enable accurate knowledge transfer. This requires combining feature alignment with target fine-tuning, but uncalibrated combinations can exacerbate misalignment between the source and target feature-label structures and reduce target generalization. Existing work, however, lacks a theoretical understanding of this critical interaction between feature alignment and target fitting. To bridge this gap, we develop a principled framework that establishes a provable generalization bound on the target error, which explains the interaction between feature alignment and target fitting through a novel concept of feature-label distortion. This bound offers actionable insights into how this interaction should be optimized for practical algorithm design. The resulting approach achieves significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Flow Maps: Mean Flow Consistency for Large-Timestep Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fixed Rounds: Data-Free Early Stopping for Practical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates decentralized collaborative learning without transmitting raw data. However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework requires an average of 45/12 (skin lesion/blood cell) additional rounds to achieve over 12.3%/8.9% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an data-free early stopping framework for FL methods.</description>

      <title>Agentic Framework for Epidemiological Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemic modeling is essential for public health planning, yet traditional approaches rely on fixed model classes that require manual redesign as pathogens, policies, and scenario assumptions evolve. We introduce EPIAGENT, an agentic framework that automatically synthesizes, calibrates, verifies, and refines epidemiological simulators by modeling disease progression as an iterative program synthesis problem. A central design choice is an explicit epidemiological flow graph intermediate representation that links scenario specifications to model structure and enables strong, modular correctness checks before code is generated. Verified flow graphs are then compiled into mechanistic models supporting interpretable parameter learning under physical and epidemiological constraints. Evaluation on epidemiological scenario case studies demonstrates that EPIAGENT captures complex growth dynamics and produces epidemiologically consistent counterfactual projections across varying vaccination and immune escape assumptions. Our results show that the agentic feedback loop prevents degeneration and significantly accelerates convergence toward valid models by mimicking professional expert workflows.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Variance Path Principle for Accurate and Stable Score-Based Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based methods are powerful across machine learning, but they face a paradox: theoretically path-independent, yet practically path-dependent.
  We resolve this by proving that practical training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the score function.
  We propose the MVP (**M**imum **V**ariance **P**ath) Principle to minimize this path variance.
  Our key contribution is deriving a closed-form expression for the variance, making optimization tractable.
  By parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns data-adaptive, low-variance paths without heuristic manual selection.
  This principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks and providing a general framework for optimizing score-based interpolation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions for Feature Learning in Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to a popular viewpoint, neural networks learn from data by first identifying low-dimensional representations, and subsequently fitting the best model in this space. Recent works provide a formalization of this phenomenon when learning multi-index models. In this setting, we are given $n$ i.i.d. pairs $({\boldsymbol x}_i,y_i)$, where the covariate vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are isotropic, and responses $y_i$ only depend on ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ through a $k$-dimensional projection ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*^{{\sf T}}{\boldsymbol x}_i$. Feature learning amounts to learning the latent space spanned by ${\boldsymbol \Theta}_*$.
  In this context, we study the gradient descent dynamics of two-layer neural networks under the proportional asymptotics $n,d\to\infty$, $n/d\to\delta$, while the dimension of the latent space $k$ and the number of hidden neurons $m$ are kept fixed. Earlier work establishes that feature learning via polynomial-time algorithms is possible if $\delta&gt; \delta_{\text{alg}}$, for $\delta_{\text{alg}}$ a threshold depending on the data distribution, and is impossible (within a certain class of algorithms) below $\delta_{\text{alg}}$. Here we derive an analogous threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ for two-layer networks. Our characterization of $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ opens the way to study the dependence of learning dynamics on the network architecture and training algorithm.
  The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ is determined by the following scenario. Training first visits points for which the gradient of the empirical risk is large and learns the directions spanned by these gradients. Then the gradient becomes smaller and the dynamics becomes dominated by negative directions of the Hessian. The threshold $\delta_{\text{NN}}$ corresponds to a phase transition in the spectrum of the Hessian in this second phase.</description>

      <title>Detecting Misbehaviors of Large Vision-Language Models by Evidential Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: %Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. %We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective. The source code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ.</description>

      <title>Learning Credal Ensembles via Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Credal predictors are models that are aware of epistemic uncertainty and produce a convex set of probabilistic predictions. They offer a principled way to quantify predictive epistemic uncertainty (EU) and have been shown to improve model robustness in various settings. However, most state-of-the-art methods mainly define EU as disagreement caused by random training initializations, which mostly reflects sensitivity to optimization randomness rather than uncertainty from deeper sources. To address this, we define EU as disagreement among models trained with varying relaxations of the i.i.d. assumption between training and test data. Based on this idea, we propose CreDRO, which learns an ensemble of plausible models through distributionally robust optimization. As a result, CreDRO captures EU not only from training randomness but also from meaningful disagreement due to potential distribution shifts between training and test data. Empirical results show that CreDRO consistently outperforms existing credal methods on tasks such as out-of-distribution detection across multiple benchmarks and selective classification in medical applications.</description>

      <title>When Less is More: The LLM Scaling Paradox in Context Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.</description>

Abstract: A novel sequence architecture is introduced, Versor, which uses Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) in place of traditional linear operations to achieve structural generalization and significant performance improvements on a variety of tasks, while offering improved interpretability and efficiency. By embedding states in the $Cl_{4,1}$ manifold and evolving them via geometric transformations (rotors), Versor natively represents $SE(3)$-equivariant relationships without requiring explicit structural encoding. Versor is validated on chaotic N-body dynamics, topological reasoning, and standard multimodal benchmarks (CIFAR-10, WikiText-103), consistently outperforming Transformers, Graph Networks, and geometric baselines (GATr, EGNN). Key results include: orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters ($200\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (0.993 vs. 0.070 MCC for ViT); and featuring a Recursive Rotor Accumulator (RRA) for $O(L)$ linear temporal complexity in dynamical systems, and a Geometric Product Attention (GPA) mechanism for $O(L^{2})$ global relational modeling, allowing for task-specific architectural pruning or hybridization depending on the required scale. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve a cumulative over $100\times$ speedup via bit-masked contraction and specialized Matrix Isomorphism kernels, reducing per-step latency to 1.05 ms and outperforming highly-optimized Transformer baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning beyond Teacher: Generalized On-Policy Distillation with Reward Extrapolation</title>

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which aligns the student with the teacher's logit distribution on student-generated trajectories, has demonstrated strong empirical gains in improving student performance and often outperforms off-policy distillation and reinforcement learning (RL) paradigms. In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in language statistics shapes the geometry of model representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal representations learned by language models consistently exhibit striking geometric structure: calendar months organize into a circle, historical years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded using a linear probe. To explain this neural code, we first show that language statistics exhibit translation symmetry (for example, the frequency with which any two months co-occur in text depends only on the time interval between them). We prove that this symmetry governs these geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models, and we analytically derive the manifold geometry of word representations. These predictions empirically match large text embedding models and large language models. Moreover, the representational geometry persists at moderate embedding dimension even when the relevant statistics are perturbed (e.g., by removing all sentences in which two months co-occur). We prove that this robustness emerges naturally when the co-occurrence statistics are controlled by an underlying latent variable. These results suggest that representational manifolds have a universal origin: symmetry in the statistics of natural data.</description>

      <title>\"UberWeb: Insights from Multilingual Curation for a 20-Trillion-Token Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilinguality is a core capability for modern foundation models, yet training high-quality multilingual models remains challenging due to uneven data availability across languages. A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the "curse of multilinguality". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs. These results show that targeted, per-language data curation mitigates multilingual interference and enables compute-efficient multilingual scaling.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking IoT Time-Series AD with Event-Level Augmentations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) for safety-critical IoT time series should be judged at the event level: reliability and earliness under realistic perturbations. Yet many studies still emphasize point-level results on curated base datasets, limiting value for model selection in practice. We introduce an evaluation protocol with unified event-level augmentations that simulate real-world issues: calibrated sensor dropout, linear and log drift, additive noise, and window shifts. We also perform sensor-level probing via mask-as-missing zeroing with per-channel influence estimation to support root-cause analysis. We evaluate 14 representative models on five public anomaly datasets (SWaT, WADI, SMD, SKAB, TEP) and two industrial datasets (steam turbine, nuclear turbogenerator) using unified splits and event aggregation. There is no universal winner: graph-structured models transfer best under dropout and long events (e.g., on SWaT under additive noise F1 drops 0.804-&gt;0.677 for a graph autoencoder, 0.759-&gt;0.680 for a graph-attention variant, and 0.762-&gt;0.756 for a hybrid graph attention model); density/flow models work well on clean stationary plants but can be fragile to monotone drift; spectral CNNs lead when periodicity is strong; reconstruction autoencoders become competitive after basic sensor vetting; predictive/hybrid dynamics help when faults break temporal dependencies but remain window-sensitive. The protocol also informs design choices: on SWaT under log drift, replacing normalizing flows with Gaussian density reduces high-stress F1 from ~0.75 to ~0.57, and fixing a learned DAG gives a small clean-set gain (~0.5-1.0 points) but increases drift sensitivity by ~8x.</description>

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. We introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights. We provide theoretical motivation for SSPO and investigate practical modifications to improve optimization behavior. Empirically, we show that SSPO improves training stability and performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Decision MetaMamba: Enhancing Selective SSM in Offline RL with Heterogeneous Sequence Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Random Network Distillation, Deep Ensembles, and Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.</description>

      <title>Why Pass@k Optimization Can Degrade Pass@1: Prompt Interference in LLM Post-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>AngelSlim: A more accessible, comprehensive, and efficient toolkit for large model compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical report introduces AngelSlim, a comprehensive and versatile toolkit for large model compression developed by the Tencent Hunyuan team. By consolidating cutting-edge algorithms, including quantization, speculative decoding, token pruning, and distillation. AngelSlim provides a unified pipeline that streamlines the transition from model compression to industrial-scale deployment. To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning. By integrating these compression strategies from low-level implementations, AngelSlim enables algorithm-focused research and tool-assisted deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated promising performance in pre-training large language models through gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective enhancement to Muon, namely Muon+, which introduces an additional normalization step after orthogonalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Muon+ through extensive pre-training experiments across a wide range of model scales and architectures. Our evaluation includes GPT-style models ranging from 130M to 774M parameters and LLaMA-style models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Muon+ in the compute-optimal training regime and further extend the token-to-parameter (T2P) ratio to an industrial level of $\approx 200$. Experimental results show that Muon+ provides a consistent boost on training and validation perplexity over Muon. We provide our code here: https://github.com/K1seki221/MuonPlus.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Maximum Likelihood Learning of DPPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In these applications, a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data is typically desirable. The algorithms used for this task to date either optimize over a limited family of DPPs, or use local improvement heuristics that do not provide theoretical guarantees of optimality.
  In his seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza (2011) conjectured that the problem is NP-complete. The lack of a formal proof prompted Brunel et al. (COLT 2017) to suggest that, in opposition to Kulesza's conjecture, there might exist a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a maximum-likelihood DPP. They also presented some preliminary evidence supporting a conjecture that they suggested might lead to such an algorithm.
  In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a $\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete.
  From a technical perspective, we reduce the problem of approximating the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP to solving a gap instance of a \textsc{$3$-Coloring} problem on a hypergraph. This hypergraph is based on the bounded-degree construction of Bogdanov et al. (FOCS 2002), which we enhance using the strong expanders of Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007). We demonstrate that if a rank-$3$ DPP achieves near-optimal log-likelihood, its marginal kernel must encode an almost perfect ``vector-coloring" of the hypergraph. Finally, we show that these continuous vectors can be decoded into a proper $3$-coloring after removing a small fraction of ``noisy" edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation of a large class of bounded functions, with minimal regularity assumptions, by ReLU neural networks. We show that the approximation error can be bounded from above by a quantity proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth. We inherit this approximation error bound from Fourier features residual networks, a type of neural network that uses complex exponential activation functions. Our proof is constructive and proceeds by conducting a careful complexity analysis associated with the approximation of a Fourier features residual network by a ReLU network.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy of Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Recommendation Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the differential privacy (DP) of the quantum recommendation algorithm of Kerenidis--Prakash and its quantum-inspired classical counterpart. Under standard low-rank and incoherence assumptions on the preference matrix, we show that the randomness already present in the algorithms' measurement/$\ell_2$-sampling steps can act as a privacy-curating mechanism, yielding $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP without injecting additional DP noise through the interface. Concretely, for a system with $m$ users and $n$ items and rank parameter $k$, we prove $\varepsilon=\mathcal O(\sqrt{k/n})$ and $\delta= \mathcal O\big(k^2/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$; in the typical regime $k=\mathrm{polylog}(m,n)$ this simplifies to $\varepsilon=\tilde{\mathcal O}(1/\sqrt n)$ and $\delta=\tilde{\mathcal O}\big(1/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$. Our analysis introduces a perturbation technique for truncated SVD under a single-entry update, which tracks the induced change in the low-rank reconstruction while avoiding unstable singular-vector comparisons. Finally, we validate the scaling on real-world rating datasets and compare against classical DP recommender baselines.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Sliced Wasserstein Kernels for High-Quality Audio Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio captioning systems face a fundamental challenge: teacher-forcing training creates exposure bias that leads to caption degeneration during inference. While contrastive methods have been proposed as solutions, they typically fail to capture the crucial temporal relationships between acoustic and linguistic modalities. We address this limitation by introducing the unbiased sliced Wasserstein RBF (USW-RBF) kernel with rotary positional embedding, specifically designed to preserve temporal information across modalities. Our approach offers a practical advantage: the kernel enables efficient stochastic gradient optimization, making it computationally feasible for real-world applications. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete audio captioning framework that integrates stochastic decoding to further mitigate caption degeneration. Extensive experiments on AudioCaps and Clotho datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves caption quality, lexical diversity, and text-to-audio retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of our USW-RBF kernel by applying it to audio reasoning tasks, where it enhances the reasoning capabilities of large audio language models on the CompA-R in terms of correctness and quality. Our kernel also improves the reasoning accuracy of the MMAU-test-mini benchmarks by $4\%$. These results establish our approach as a powerful and generalizable solution for cross-modal alignment challenges in audio-language tasks.</description>

      <title>SODAs: Sparse Optimization for the Discovery of Differential and Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods for DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems. It has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms, caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships, by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-inspired model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy relies on iterative reconfigurations of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is also proposed to guide the model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. By combining the reconfiguration and the evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal model configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models Via Modular SkillPacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-capability transfer is a key challenge in large language model (LLM) research, with applications in multi-task integration, model compression, and continual learning. Recent works like FuseLLM and FuseChat have demonstrated the potential of transferring multiple model capabilities to lightweight models, enhancing adaptability and efficiency, which motivates our investigation into more efficient cross-capability transfer methods. However, existing approaches primarily focus on small, homogeneous models, limiting their applicability. For large, heterogeneous models, knowledge distillation with full-parameter fine-tuning often overlooks the student model's intrinsic capacity and risks catastrophic forgetting, while PEFT methods struggle to effectively absorb knowledge from source LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce GraftLLM, a novel method that stores source model capabilities in a target model with SkillPack format. This approach preserves general capabilities, reduces parameter conflicts, and supports forget-free continual learning and model fusion. We employ a module-aware adaptive compression strategy to compress parameter updates, ensuring efficient storage while maintaining task-specific knowledge. The resulting SkillPack serves as a compact and transferable knowledge carrier, ideal for heterogeneous model fusion and continual learning. Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate that GraftLLM outperforms existing techniques in knowledge transfer, knowledge fusion, and forget-free learning, providing a scalable and efficient solution for cross-capability transfer. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/duguodong7/GraftLLM.</description>

      <title>LinGuinE: Longitudinal Guidance Estimation for Volumetric Tumour Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal volumetric tumour segmentation is critical for radiotherapy planning and response assessment, yet this problem is underexplored and most methods produce single-timepoint semantic masks, lack lesion correspondence, and offer limited radiologist control. We introduce LinGuinE (Longitudinal Guidance Estimation), a PyTorch framework that combines image registration and guided segmentation to deliver lesion-level tracking and volumetric masks across all scans in a longitudinal study from a single radiologist prompt. LinGuinE is temporally direction agnostic, requires no training on longitudinal data, and allows any registration and semi-automatic segmentation algorithm to be repurposed for the task. We evaluate various combinations of registration and segmentation algorithms within the framework. LinGuinE achieves state-of-the-art segmentation and tracking performance across four datasets with a total of 456 longitudinal studies. Tumour segmentation performance shows minimal degradation with increasing temporal separation. We conduct ablation studies to determine the impact of autoregression, pathology specific finetuning, and the use of real radiologist prompts. We release our code and substantial public benchmarking for longitudinal segmentation, facilitating future research.</description>

      <title>On the Interpolation Error of Nonlinear Attention versus Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attention has become the core building block of modern machine learning (ML) by efficiently capturing the long-range dependencies among input tokens. Its inherently parallelizable structure allows for efficient performance scaling with the rapidly increasing size of both data and model parameters. Despite its central role, the theoretical understanding of Attention, especially in the nonlinear setting, is progressing at a more modest pace.
  This paper provides a precise characterization of the interpolation error for a nonlinear Attention, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and the embedding dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Under a signal-plus-noise data model and for fixed Attention weights, we derive explicit (limiting) expressions for the mean-squared interpolation error. Leveraging recent advances in random matrix theory, we show that nonlinear Attention generally incurs a larger interpolation error than linear regression on random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the input contains a structured signal, particularly if the Attention weights align with the signal direction. Our theoretical insights are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources) and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically, increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model architectures.</description>

      <title>LayerT2V: A Unified Multi-Layer Video Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly, but existing methods typically output only the final composited video and lack editable layered representations, limiting their use in professional workflows. We propose \textbf{LayerT2V}, a unified multi-layer video generation framework that produces multiple semantically consistent outputs in a single inference pass: the full video, an independent background layer, and multiple foreground RGB layers with corresponding alpha mattes. Our key insight is that recent video generation backbones use high compression in both time and space, enabling us to serialize multiple layer representations along the temporal dimension and jointly model them on a shared generation trajectory. This turns cross-layer consistency into an intrinsic objective, improving semantic alignment and temporal coherence. To mitigate layer ambiguity and conditional leakage, we augment a shared DiT backbone with LayerAdaLN and layer-aware cross-attention modulation. LayerT2V is trained in three stages: alpha mask VAE adaptation, joint multi-layer learning, and multi-foreground extension. We also introduce \textbf{VidLayer}, the first large-scale dataset for multi-layer video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerT2V substantially outperforms prior methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and cross-layer coherence.</description>

      <title>Understanding protein function with a multimodal retrieval-augmented foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) learn probability distributions over natural protein sequences. By learning from hundreds of millions of natural protein sequences, protein understanding and design capabilities emerge. Recent works have shown that scaling these models improves structure prediction, but does not seem to improve mutation understanding and representation quality for protein function prediction. We introduce PoET-2, a multimodal, retrieval-augmented protein foundation model that incorporates in-context learning of family-specific evolutionary constraints with optional structure conditioning to learn generative distributions over protein sequences. PoET-2 uses a hierarchical transformer encoder that is equivariant to sequence context ordering and a dual decoder architecture with both causal and masked language modeling objectives, allowing PoET-2 to operate in both fully generative and bidirectional representation learning modes. PoET-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot variant effect prediction, excelling at scoring variants with multiple mutations and challenging indel mutations. In supervised settings, PoET-2 embeddings outperform previous methods for learning sequence-function relationships, especially with small datasets. This work highlights the benefits of combining retrieval augmentation with multimodal, family-centric modeling for advancing protein foundation models.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Hybrid Caching for Efficient Text-to-Video Diffusion Model Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient video generation models are increasingly vital for multimedia synthetic content generation. Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation. However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless, existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies, struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference efficiency compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Sharing information from multiple distinct yet related physical systems can alleviate this ill-possendess. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard multi-system Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of a specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area (VWFA) in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that they predict human VWFA neural responses. Ablating model VWF units leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing, and mirrors dyslexic behavior in font sensitivity. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating brain disorders.</description>

      <title>Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict.

      <title>Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Face anonymization aims to protect sensitive identity information by altering faces while preserving visual realism and utility for downstream computer vision tasks. Current methods struggle to simultaneously ensure high image quality, strong security guarantees, and controlled reversibility for authorized identity recovery at a later time. To improve the image quality of generated anonymized faces, recent methods have adopted diffusion models. However, these new diffusion-based anonymization methods do not provide a mechanism to restrict de-anonymization to trusted parties, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework for secure, reversible face anonymization via secret-key conditioning. Our method injects the secret key directly into the diffusion process, enabling anonymization and authorized face reconstruction while preventing unauthorized de-anonymization. The use of deterministic forward and reverse diffusion steps guarantees exact identity recovery when the correct secret key is available. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW demonstrate that our approach achieves better anonymization and de-anonymization capabilities than prior work. We also show that our method remains robust to incorrect or adversarial key de-anonymization. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Atlas-free Brain Network Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current atlas-based approaches to brain network analysis rely heavily on standardized anatomical or connectivity-driven brain atlases. However, these fixed atlases often introduce significant limitations, such as spatial misalignment across individuals, functional heterogeneity within predefined regions, and atlas-selection biases, collectively undermining the reliability and interpretability of the derived brain networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel atlas-free brain network transformer (atlas-free BNT) that leverages individualized brain parcellations derived directly from subject-specific resting-state fMRI data. Our approach computes ROI-to-voxel connectivity features in a standardized voxel-based feature space, which are subsequently processed using the BNT architecture to produce comparable subject-level embeddings. Experimental evaluations on sex classification and brain-connectome age prediction tasks demonstrate that our atlas-free BNT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art atlas-based methods, including elastic net, BrainGNN, Graphormer and the original BNT. Our atlas-free approach significantly improves the precision, robustness, and generalizability of brain network analyses. This advancement holds great potential to enhance neuroimaging biomarkers and clinical diagnostic tools for personalized precision medicine.

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity and High-Dimensional Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose \textit{DeepMartingale}, a deep-learning framework for the dual formulation of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems under continuous-time models. Leveraging a martingale representation, our method implements a \emph{pure-dual} procedure that directly optimizes over a parameterized class of martingales, producing computable and tight \emph{dual upper bounds} for the value function in high-dimensional settings without requiring any primal information or Snell-envelope approximation. We prove convergence of the resulting upper bounds under mild assumptions for both first- and second-moment losses. A key contribution is an expressivity theorem showing that \textit{DeepMartingale} can approximate the true value function to any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ using neural networks of size at most $\tilde{c} d^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, with constants independent of the dimension $d$ and accuracy $\varepsilon$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Since expressivity in this setting translates into scalability, our theory also motivates estimating the dimension scaling law to guide architecture design and the training setup in deep learning-based numerical computation and the choice of rebalancing frequency for the related hedging strategy. The learned martingale representation further yields a practical and dimension-scalable \emph{deep delta hedging strategy}. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional Bermudan option benchmarks confirm convergence, expressivity, scalable training, and the stability of the resulting upper bounds and hedging performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vine copulas offer flexible multivariate dependence modeling and have become widely used in machine learning. Yet, structure learning remains a key challenge. Early heuristics, such as Dissmann's greedy algorithm, are still considered the gold standard but are often suboptimal. We propose random search algorithms and a statistical framework based on model confidence sets, to improve structure selection, provide theoretical guarantees on selection probabilities, and serve as a foundation for ensembling. Empirical results on real-world data sets show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.</description>

      <title>Inference-Cost-Aware Dynamic Tree Construction for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this, speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures, they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure. Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5 % to 20%. The code is available at https://github.com/EAGLE-Research/sglang-eagle4.</description>

      <title>Temporal Sparse Autoencoders: Leveraging the Sequential Nature of Language for Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Translating the internal representations and computations of models into concepts that humans can understand is a key goal of interpretability. While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they often only recover token-specific, noisy, or highly local concepts. We argue that this limitation stems from neglecting the temporal structure of language, where semantic content typically evolves smoothly over sequences. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure despite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway for unsupervised interpretability in language models.</description>

      <title>Intelligence per Watt: Measuring Intelligence Efficiency of Local AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) queries are predominantly processed by frontier models in centralized cloud infrastructure. Rapidly growing demand strains this paradigm, and cloud providers struggle to scale infrastructure at pace. Two advances enable us to rethink this paradigm: small LMs (&lt;=20B active parameters) now achieve competitive performance to frontier models on many tasks, and local accelerators (e.g., Apple M4 Max) run these models at interactive latencies. This raises the question: can local inference viably redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure? Answering this requires measuring whether local LMs can accurately answer real-world queries and whether they can do so efficiently enough to be practical on power-constrained devices (i.e., laptops). We propose intelligence per watt (IPW), task accuracy divided by unit of power, as a metric for assessing capability and efficiency of local inference across model-accelerator pairs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study across 20+ state-of-the-art local LMs, 8 accelerators, and a representative subset of LLM traffic: 1M real-world single-turn chat and reasoning queries. For each query, we measure accuracy, energy, latency, and power. Our analysis reveals $3$ findings. First, local LMs can accurately answer 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries with accuracy varying by domain. Second, from 2023-2025, IPW improved 5.3x and local query coverage rose from 23.2% to 71.3%. Third, local accelerators achieve at least 1.4x lower IPW than cloud accelerators running identical models, revealing significant headroom for optimization. These findings demonstrate that local inference can meaningfully redistribute demand from centralized infrastructure, with IPW serving as the critical metric for tracking this transition. We release our IPW profiling harness here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/intelligence-per-watt.</description>

      <title>VLM-Pruner: Buffering for Spatial Sparsity in an Efficient VLM Centrifugal Token Pruning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup. The code is available at https://github.com/Casey-bit/VLMPruner.</description>

      <title>One-Step Diffusion Samplers via Self-Distillation and Deterministic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and statistics. Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions. Our proposed sampler therefore achieves both fast sampling and stable evidence estimate in only one or few steps. Across challenging synthetic and Bayesian benchmarks, it achieves competitive sample quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer network evaluations while maintaining robust ELBO estimates.</description>

      <title>Imitation Game: Reproducing Deep Learning Bugs Leveraging an Intelligent Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their wide adoption in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, software engineering), Deep Learning (DL)-based applications suffer from many bugs, failures, and vulnerabilities. Reproducing these bugs is essential for their resolution, but it is extremely challenging due to the inherent nondeterminism of DL models and their tight coupling with hardware and software environments. According to recent studies, only about 3% of DL bugs can be reliably reproduced using manual approaches. To address these challenges, we present RepGen, a novel, automated, and intelligent approach for reproducing deep learning bugs. RepGen constructs a learning-enhanced context from a project, develops a comprehensive plan for bug reproduction, employs an iterative generate-validate-refine mechanism, and thus generates such code using an LLM that reproduces the bug at hand. We evaluate RepGen on 106 real-world deep learning bugs and achieve a reproduction rate of 80.19%, a 19.81% improvement over the state-of-the-art measure. A developer study involving 27 participants shows that RepGen improves the success rate of DL bug reproduction by 23.35%, reduces the time to reproduce by 56.8%, and lowers participants' cognitive load.</description>

      <title>LeanCat: A Benchmark Suite for Formal Category Theory in Lean (Part I: 1-Categories)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, current benchmarks fail to adequately measure library-grounded abstraction -- the ability to reason with high-level interfaces and reusable structures central to modern mathematics and software engineering. We introduce LeanCat, a challenging benchmark comprising 100 fully formalized category-theory tasks in Lean. Unlike algebra or arithmetic, category theory serves as a rigorous stress test for structural, interface-level reasoning. Our evaluation reveals a severe abstraction gap: the best state-of-the-art model solves only 12.0% of tasks at pass@4, with performance collapsing from 55.0% on Easy tasks to 0.0% on High-difficulty tasks, highlighting a failure in compositional generalization. To overcome this, we evaluate LeanBridge, a retrieval-augmented agent that employs a retrieve-generate-verify loop. LeanBridge achieves a peak success rate of 24.0% -- doubling the performance of the best static baseline. These results empirically demonstrate that iterative refinement and dynamic library retrieval are not merely optimizations but strict necessities for neuro-symbolic reasoning in abstract domains. LeanCat offers a compact, reusable testbed for tracking progress toward reliable, research-level formalization.</description>

      <title>Denoising the Deep Sky: Physics-Based CCD Noise Formation for Astronomical Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astronomical imaging remains noise-limited under practical observing conditions. Standard calibration pipelines remove structured artifacts but largely leave stochastic noise unresolved. Although learning-based denoising has shown strong potential, progress is constrained by scarce paired training data and the requirement for physically interpretable models in scientific workflows. We propose a physics-based noise synthesis framework tailored to CCD noise formation in the telescope. The pipeline models photon shot noise, photo-response non-uniformity, dark-current noise, readout effects, and localized outliers arising from cosmic-ray hits and hot pixels. To obtain low-noise inputs for synthesis, we stack multiple unregistered exposures to produce high-SNR bases. Realistic noisy counterparts synthesized from these bases using our noise model enable the construction of abundant paired datasets for supervised learning. Extensive experiments on our real-world multi-band dataset curated from two ground-based telescopes demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in both photometric and scientific accuracy.</description>

      <title>Controlling Exploration-Exploitation in GFlowNets via Markov Chain Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objectives implicitly fix an equal mixing of forward and backward policies, potentially constraining the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training. By further exploring the link between GFlowNets and Markov chains, we establish an equivalence between GFlowNet objectives and Markov chain reversibility, thereby revealing the origin of such constraints, and provide a framework for adapting Markov chain properties to GFlowNets. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose $\alpha$-GFNs, which generalize the mixing via a tunable parameter $\alpha$. This generalization enables direct control over exploration-exploitation dynamics to enhance mode discovery capabilities, while ensuring convergence to unique flows. Across various benchmarks, including Set, Bit Sequence, and Molecule Generation, $\alpha$-GFN objectives consistently outperform previous GFlowNet objectives, achieving up to a $10 \times$ increase in the number of discovered modes.</description>

      <title>Spark: Modular Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.</description>

      <title>VQ-Style: Disentangling Style and Content in Motion with Residual Quantized Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human motion data is inherently rich and complex, containing both semantic content and subtle stylistic features that are challenging to model. We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer. Our approach is guided by the insight that content corresponds to coarse motion attributes while style captures the finer, expressive details. To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating codebook learning with contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending.</description>

      <title>The Wisdom of Many Queries: Complexity-Diversity Principle for Dense Retriever Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior synthetic query generation for dense retrieval produces one query per document, focusing on quality. We systematically study multi-query synthesis, discovering a quality-diversity trade-off: quality benefits in-domain, diversity benefits out-of-domain (OOD). Experiments on 31 datasets show diversity especially benefits multi-hop retrieval. Analysis reveals diversity benefit correlates with query complexity (r&gt;=0.95), measured by content words (CW). We formalize this as the Complexity-Diversity Principle (CDP): query complexity determines optimal diversity. CDP provides thresholds (CW&gt;10: use diversity; CW&lt;7: avoid it) and enables CW-weighted training that improves OOD even with single-query data.</description>

      <title>GPT-4o Lacks Core Features of Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of a domain-general or consistent ToM.</description>

      <title>Large-scale online deanonymization with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that large language models can be used to perform at-scale deanonymization. With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to classical deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method. Our results show that the practical obscurity protecting pseudonymous users online no longer holds and that threat models for online privacy need to be reconsidered.</description>

      <title>LLM4Cov: Execution-Aware Agentic Learning for High-coverage Testbench Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Execution-aware LLM agents offer a promising paradigm for learning from tool feedback, but such feedback is often expensive and slow to obtain, making online reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. High-coverage hardware verification exemplifies this challenge due to its reliance on industrial simulators and non-differentiable execution signals. We propose LLM4Cov, an offline agent-learning framework that models verification as memoryless state transitions guided by deterministic evaluators. Building on this formulation, we introduce execution-validated data curation, policy-aware agentic data synthesis, and worst-state-prioritized sampling to enable scalable learning under execution constraints. We further curate a reality-aligned benchmark adapted from an existing verification suite through a revised evaluation protocol. Using the proposed pipeline, a compact 4B-parameter model achieves 69.2% coverage pass rate under agentic evaluation, outperforming its teacher by 5.3% and demonstrating competitive performance against models an order of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Precision in High-Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training is critical for optimizing the trade-off between model quality and training costs, necessitating the joint allocation of model size, dataset size, and numerical precision. While empirical scaling laws suggest that quantization impacts effective model and data capacities or acts as an additive error, the theoretical mechanisms governing these effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of scaling laws for low-precision training within a high-dimensional sketched linear regression framework. By analyzing multiplicative (signal-dependent) and additive (signal-independent) quantization, we identify a critical dichotomy in their scaling behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while both schemes introduce an additive error and degrade the effective data size, they exhibit distinct effects on effective model size: multiplicative quantization maintains the full-precision model size, whereas additive quantization reduces the effective model size. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings. By rigorously characterizing the complex interplay among model scale, dataset size, and quantization error, our work provides a principled theoretical basis for optimizing training protocols under practical hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Latent Introspection: Models Can Detect Prior Concept Injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -&gt; 39.9%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.61 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.</description>

      <title>DRESS: A Continuous Framework for Structural Graph Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy is a cornerstone framework for graph isomorphism testing and structural analysis. However, scaling beyond 1-WL to 3-WL and higher requires tensor-based operations that scale as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ or $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$, making them computationally prohibitive for large graphs. In this paper, we start from the Original-DRESS equation (Castrillo, Le\'{o}n, and G\'{o}mez, 2018) -- a parameter-free, continuous dynamical system on edges -- and show that it distinguishes the prism graph from $K_{3,3}$, a pair that 1-WL provably cannot separate. We then generalize it to Motif-DRESS, which replaces triangle neighborhoods with arbitrary structural motifs and converges to a unique fixed point under three sufficient conditions, and further to Generalized-DRESS, an abstract template parameterized by the choice of neighborhood operator, aggregation function and norm. Finally, we introduce $\Delta$-DRESS, which runs DRESS on each node-deleted subgraph $G \setminus \{v\}$, connecting the framework to the Kelly--Ulam reconstruction conjecture. Both Motif-DRESS and $\Delta$-DRESS empirically distinguish Strongly Regular Graphs (SRGs) -- such as the Rook and Shrikhande graphs -- that confound 3-WL. Our results establish the DRESS family as a highly scalable framework that empirically surpasses both 1-WL and 3-WL on well-known benchmark graphs, without the prohibitive $\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ computational cost.</description>

      <title>Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=\sigma_k^{2}/(2\mu_k)$, with $\mu_k{=}\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $\sigma_k^2{=}\mathrm{Var}[p_k]$ across posterior samples. The decomposition follows from a second-order Taylor expansion of the entropy; the $1/\mu_k$ weighting corrects boundary suppression and makes $C_k$ comparable across rare and common classes. By construction $\sum_k C_k \approx \mathrm{MI}$, and a companion skewness diagnostic flags inputs where the approximation degrades. After characterising the axiomatic properties of $C_k$, we validate it on three tasks: (i) selective prediction for diabetic retinopathy, where critical-class $C_k$ reduces selective risk by 34.7\% over MI and 56.2\% over variance baselines; (ii) out-of-distribution detection on clinical and image benchmarks, where $\sum_k C_k$ achieves the highest AUROC and the per-class view exposes asymmetric shifts invisible to MI; and (iii) a controlled label-noise study in which $\sum_k C_k$ shows less sensitivity to injected aleatoric noise than MI under end-to-end Bayesian training, while both metrics degrade under transfer learning. Across all tasks, the quality of the posterior approximation shapes uncertainty at least as strongly as the choice of metric, suggesting that how uncertainty is propagated through the network matters as much as how it is measured.</description>

      <title>Under the Influence: Quantifying Persuasion and Vigilance in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With increasing integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into areas of high-stakes human decision-making, it is important to understand the risks they introduce as advisors. To be useful advisors, LLMs must sift through large amounts of content, written with both benevolent and malicious intent, and then use this information to convince a user to take a specific action. This involves two social capacities: vigilance (the ability to determine which information to use, and which to discard) and persuasion (synthesizing the available evidence to make a convincing argument). While existing work has investigated these capacities in isolation, there has been little prior investigation of how these capacities may be linked. Here, we use a simple multi-turn puzzle-solving game, Sokoban, to study LLMs' abilities to persuade and be rationally vigilant towards other LLM agents. We find that puzzle-solving performance, persuasive capability, and vigilance are dissociable capacities in LLMs. Performing well on the game does not automatically mean a model can detect when it is being misled, even if the possibility of deception is explicitly mentioned. However, LLMs do consistently modulate their token use, using fewer tokens to reason when advice is benevolent and more when it is malicious, even if they are still persuaded to take actions leading them to failure. To our knowledge, our work presents the first investigation of the relationship between persuasion, vigilance, and task performance in LLMs, and suggests that monitoring all three independently will be critical for future work in AI safety.</description>
