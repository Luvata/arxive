      <title>Efficient Mitigation of Bus Bunching through Setter-Based Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curriculum learning has been growing in the domain of reinforcement learning as a method of improving training efficiency for various tasks. It involves modifying the difficulty (lessons) of the environment as the agent learns, in order to encourage more optimal agent behavior and higher reward states. However, most curriculum learning methods currently involve discrete transitions of the curriculum or predefined steps by the programmer or using automatic curriculum learning on only a small subset training such as only on an adversary. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to curriculum learning that uses a Setter Model to automatically generate an action space, adversary strength, initialization, and bunching strength. Transportation and traffic optimization is a well known area of study, especially for reinforcement learning based solutions. We specifically look at the bus bunching problem for the context of this study. The main idea of the problem is to minimize the delays caused by inefficient bus timings for passengers arriving and departing from a system of buses. While the heavy exploration in the area makes innovation and improvement with regards to performance marginal, it simultaneously provides an effective baseline for developing new generalized techniques. Our group is particularly interested in examining curriculum learning and its effect on training efficiency and overall performance. We decide to try a lesser known approach to curriculum learning, in which the curriculum is not fixed or discretely thresholded. Our method for automated curriculum learning involves a curriculum that is dynamically chosen and learned by an adversary network made to increase the difficulty of the agent's training, and defined by multiple forms of input. Our results are shown in the following sections of this paper.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal Value Semantics-based Abstraction for Dense Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) represent a specialized form of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that incorporates intelligent components, notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), to undertake multifaceted tasks encompassing perception, decision-making, and control. The utilization of DRL for decision-making facilitates dynamic interaction with the environment, generating control actions aimed at maximizing cumulative rewards. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainty of the operational environment and the intricate nature of ICPS necessitate exploration within complex and dynamic state spaces during the learning phase. DRL confronts challenges in terms of efficiency, generalization capabilities, and data scarcity during decision-making process. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative abstract modeling approach grounded in spatial-temporal value semantics, capturing the evolution in the distribution of semantic value across time and space. A semantics-based abstraction is introduced to construct an abstract Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the DRL learning process. Furthermore, optimization techniques for abstraction are delineated, aiming to refine the abstract model and mitigate semantic gaps between abstract and concrete states. The efficacy of the abstract modeling is assessed through the evaluation and analysis of the abstract MDP model using PRISM. A series of experiments are conducted, involving diverse scenarios such as lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control, and intersection crossroad assistance, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our abstracting approach.</description>

      <title>Achieving Dimension-Free Communication in Federated Learning via Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaborative and privacy-preserving machine learning across distributed data sources. However, the substantial communication costs associated with FL pose a significant challenge to its efficiency. Specifically, in each communication round, the communication costs scale linearly with the model's dimension, which presents a formidable obstacle, especially in large model scenarios. Despite various communication efficient strategies, the intrinsic dimension-dependent communication cost remains a major bottleneck for current FL implementations. In this paper, we introduce a novel dimension-free communication strategy for FL, leveraging zero-order optimization techniques. We propose a new algorithm, FedDisco, which facilitates the transmission of only a constant number of scalar values between clients and the server in each communication round, thereby reducing the communication cost from $\mathscr{O}(d)$ to $\mathscr{O}(1)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the model parameters. Theoretically, in non-convex functions, we prove that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art rates, which show a linear speedup of the number of clients and local steps under standard assumptions and dimension-free rate for low effective rank scenarios. Empirical evaluations through classic deep learning training and large language model fine-tuning substantiate significant reductions in communication overhead compared to traditional FL approaches.</description>

      <title>CausalConceptTS: Causal Attributions for Time Series Classification using High Fidelity Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the excelling performance of machine learning models, understanding the decisions of machine learning models remains a long-standing goal. While commonly used attribution methods in explainable AI attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on associational rather than causal relationships. In this study, within the context of time series classification, we introduce a novel framework to assess the causal effect of concepts, i.e., predefined segments within a time series, on specific classification outcomes. To achieve this, we leverage state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative models to estimate counterfactual outcomes. Our approach compares these causal attributions with closely related associational attributions, both theoretically and empirically. We demonstrate the insights gained by our approach for a diverse set of qualitatively different time series classification tasks. Although causal and associational attributions might often share some similarities, in all cases they differ in important details, underscoring the risks associated with drawing causal conclusions from associational data alone. We believe that the proposed approach is widely applicable also in other domains, particularly where predefined segmentations are available, to shed some light on the limits of associational attributions.</description>

      <title>Basis Selection: Low-Rank Decomposition of Pretrained Large Language Models for Target Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) significantly enhance the performance of various applications, but they are computationally intensive and energy-demanding. This makes it challenging to deploy them on devices with limited resources, such as personal computers and mobile/wearable devices, and results in substantial inference costs in resource-rich environments like cloud servers. To extend the use of LLMs, we introduce a low-rank decomposition approach to effectively compress these models, tailored to the requirements of specific applications. We observe that LLMs pretrained on general datasets contain many redundant components not needed for particular applications. Our method focuses on identifying and removing these redundant parts, retaining only the necessary elements for the target applications. Specifically, we represent the weight matrices of LLMs as a linear combination of base components. We then prune the irrelevant bases and enhance the model with new bases beneficial for specific applications. Deep compression results on the Llama 2-7b and -13B models, conducted on target applications including mathematical reasoning and code generation, show that our method significantly reduces model size while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art low-rank compression techniques.</description>

      <title>Risk Factor Identification In Osteoporosis Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the reliability of identified risk factors associated with osteoporosis is investigated using a new clustering-based method on electronic medical records. This study proposes utilizing a new CLustering Iterations Framework (CLIF) that includes an iterative clustering framework that can adapt any of the following three components: clustering, feature selection, and principal feature identification. The study proposes using Wasserstein distance to identify principal features, borrowing concepts from the optimal transport theory. The study also suggests using a combination of ANOVA and ablation tests to select influential features from a data set. Some risk factors presented in existing works are endorsed by our identified significant clusters, while the reliability of some other risk factors is weakened.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge Implicit Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) are a powerful variant of diffusion models for interpolating between two arbitrary paired distributions given as endpoints. Despite their promising performance in tasks like image translation, DDBMs require a computationally intensive sampling process that involves the simulation of a (stochastic) differential equation through hundreds of network evaluations. In this work, we present diffusion bridge implicit models (DBIMs) for accelerated sampling of diffusion bridges without extra training. We generalize DDBMs via a class of non-Markovian diffusion bridges defined on the discretized timesteps concerning sampling, which share the same training objective as DDBMs. These generalized diffusion bridges give rise to generative processes ranging from stochastic to deterministic (i.e., an implicit probabilistic model) while being up to 25$\times$ faster than the vanilla sampler of DDBMs. Moreover, the deterministic sampling procedure yielded by DBIMs enables faithful encoding and reconstruction by a booting noise used in the initial sampling step, and allows us to perform semantically meaningful interpolation in image translation tasks by regarding the booting noise as the latent variable.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Impact of Model Expansion through the Minima Manifold: A Loss Landscape Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal model for a given task is often challenging to determine, requiring training multiple models from scratch which becomes prohibitive as dataset and model sizes grow. A more efficient alternative is to reuse smaller pre-trained models by expanding them, however, this is not widely adopted as how this impacts training dynamics remains poorly understood. While prior works have introduced statistics to measure these effects, they remain flawed. To rectify this, we offer a new approach for understanding and quantifying the impact of expansion through the lens of the loss landscape, which has been shown to contain a manifold of linearly connected minima. Building on this new perspective, we propose a metric to study the impact of expansion by estimating the size of the manifold. Experimental results show a clear relationship between gains in performance and manifold size, enabling the comparison of candidate models and presenting a first step towards expanding models more reliably based on geometric properties of the loss landscape.</description>

      <title>UnitNorm: Rethinking Normalization for Transformers in Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalization techniques are crucial for enhancing Transformer models' performance and stability in time series analysis tasks, yet traditional methods like batch and layer normalization often lead to issues such as token shift, attention shift, and sparse attention. We propose UnitNorm, a novel approach that scales input vectors by their norms and modulates attention patterns, effectively circumventing these challenges. Grounded in existing normalization frameworks, UnitNorm's effectiveness is demonstrated across diverse time series analysis tasks, including forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection, via a rigorous evaluation on 6 state-of-the-art models and 10 datasets. Notably, UnitNorm shows superior performance, especially in scenarios requiring robust attention mechanisms and contextual comprehension, evidenced by significant improvements by up to a 1.46 decrease in MSE for forecasting, and a 4.89% increase in accuracy for classification. This work not only calls for a reevaluation of normalization strategies in time series Transformers but also sets a new direction for enhancing model performance and stability.

      <title>Learning accurate and interpretable decision trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning and yield easy-to-understand models. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature for learning a decision tree classifier, with different techniques working well for data from different domains. In this work, we develop approaches to design decision tree learning algorithms given repeated access to data from the same domain. We propose novel parameterized classes of node splitting criteria in top-down algorithms, which interpolate between popularly used entropy and Gini impurity based criteria, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to learn the splitting function appropriate for the data at hand. We also study the sample complexity of tuning prior parameters in Bayesian decision tree learning, and extend our results to decision tree regression. We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning. We also study the interpretability of the learned decision trees and introduce a data-driven approach for optimizing the explainability versus accuracy trade-off using decision trees. Finally, we demonstrate the significance of our approach on real world datasets by learning data-specific decision trees which are simultaneously more accurate and interpretable.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the Banded Matrix Factorization Mechanism for Differentially Private ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DP-BandMF offers a powerful approach to differentially private machine learning, balancing privacy amplification with noise correlation for optimal noise reduction. However, its scalability has been limited to settings where the number of training iterations is less than $10^4$. In this work, we present techniques that significantly extend DP-BandMF's reach, enabling use in settings with and over $10^6$ training iterations. Our enhanced implementation, coupled with extensive experiments, provides clear guidelines on selecting the optimal number of bands. These insights offer practitioners a deeper understanding of DP-BandMF's performance and how to maximize its utility for privacy-preserving machine learning.</description>

      <title>SF-DQN: Provable Knowledge Transfer using Successor Feature for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the transfer reinforcement learning (RL) problem where multiple RL problems have different reward functions but share the same underlying transition dynamics. In this setting, the Q-function of each RL problem (task) can be decomposed into a successor feature (SF) and a reward mapping: the former characterizes the transition dynamics, and the latter characterizes the task-specific reward function. This Q-function decomposition, coupled with a policy improvement operator known as generalized policy improvement (GPI), reduces the sample complexity of finding the optimal Q-function, and thus the SF \&amp; GPI framework exhibits promising empirical performance compared to traditional RL methods like Q-learning. However, its theoretical foundations remain largely unestablished, especially when learning the successor features using deep neural networks (SF-DQN). This paper studies the provable knowledge transfer using SFs-DQN in transfer RL problems. We establish the first convergence analysis with provable generalization guarantees for SF-DQN with GPI. The theory reveals that SF-DQN with GPI outperforms conventional RL approaches, such as deep Q-network, in terms of both faster convergence rate and better generalization. Numerical experiments on real and synthetic RL tasks support the superior performance of SF-DQN \&amp; GPI, aligning with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a 'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis aims to predict the timing of future events across various fields, from medical outcomes to customer churn. However, the integration of clustering into survival analysis, particularly for precision medicine, remains underexplored. This study introduces SurvMixClust, a novel algorithm for survival analysis that integrates clustering with survival function prediction within a unified framework. SurvMixClust learns latent representations for clustering while also predicting individual survival functions using a mixture of non-parametric experts. Our evaluations on five public datasets show that SurvMixClust creates balanced clusters with distinct survival curves, outperforms clustering baselines, and competes with non-clustering survival models in predictive accuracy, as measured by the time-dependent c-index and log-rank metrics.</description>

      <title>Can Implicit Bias Imply Adversarial Robustness?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implicit bias of gradient-based training algorithms has been considered mostly beneficial as it leads to trained networks that often generalize well. However, Frei et al. (2023) show that such implicit bias can harm adversarial robustness. Specifically, when the data consists of clusters with small inter-cluster correlation, a shallow (two-layer) ReLU network trained by gradient flow generalizes well, but it is not robust to adversarial attacks of small radius, despite the existence of a much more robust classifier that can be explicitly constructed from a shallow network. In this paper, we extend recent analyses of neuron alignment to show that a shallow network with a polynomial ReLU activation (pReLU) trained by gradient flow not only generalizes well but is also robust to adversarial attacks. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay between data structure and architecture design in the implicit bias and robustness of trained networks.</description>

      <title>Transformers represent belief state geometry in their residual stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What computational structure are we building into large language models when we train them on next-token prediction? Here, we present evidence that this structure is given by the meta-dynamics of belief updating over hidden states of the data-generating process. Leveraging the theory of optimal prediction, we anticipate and then find that belief states are linearly represented in the residual stream of transformers, even in cases where the predicted belief state geometry has highly nontrivial fractal structure. We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a framework connecting the structure of training data to the computational structure and representations that transformers use to carry out their behavior.</description>

      <title>Robust width: A lightweight and certifiable adversarial defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to so-called adversarial examples: inputs which are intentionally constructed to cause the model to make incorrect predictions or classifications. Adversarial examples are often visually indistinguishable from natural data samples, making them hard to detect. As such, they pose significant threats to the reliability of deep learning systems. In this work, we study an adversarial defense based on the robust width property (RWP), which was recently introduced for compressed sensing. We show that a specific input purification scheme based on the RWP gives theoretical robustness guarantees for images that are approximately sparse. The defense is easy to implement and can be applied to any existing model without additional training or finetuning. We empirically validate the defense on ImageNet against $L^\infty$ perturbations at perturbation budgets ranging from $4/255$ to $32/255$. In the black-box setting, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially for large perturbations. In the white-box setting, depending on the choice of base classifier, we closely match the state of the art in robust ImageNet classification while avoiding the need for additional data, larger models or expensive adversarial training routines.

      <title>BadGD: A unified data-centric framework to identify gradient descent vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BadGD, a unified theoretical framework that exposes the vulnerabilities of gradient descent algorithms through strategic backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks involve embedding malicious triggers into a training dataset to disrupt the model's learning process. Our framework introduces three novel constructs: Max RiskWarp Trigger, Max GradWarp Trigger, and Max GradDistWarp Trigger, each designed to exploit specific aspects of gradient descent by distorting empirical risk, deterministic gradients, and stochastic gradients respectively. We rigorously define clean and backdoored datasets and provide mathematical formulations for assessing the distortions caused by these malicious backdoor triggers. By measuring the impact of these triggers on the model training procedure, our framework bridges existing empirical findings with theoretical insights, demonstrating how a malicious party can exploit gradient descent hyperparameters to maximize attack effectiveness. In particular, we show that these exploitations can significantly alter the loss landscape and gradient calculations, leading to compromised model integrity and performance. This research underscores the severe threats posed by such data-centric attacks and highlights the urgent need for robust defenses in machine learning. BadGD sets a new standard for understanding and mitigating adversarial manipulations, ensuring the reliability and security of AI systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data. As these models are costly to train and evaluate, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal. Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transductive Confidence Machine Nearest Neighbours (TCMNN) algorithm and a supporting, simple user interface was developed. Different settings of the TCMNN algorithms' parameters were tested on medical data sets, in addition to the use of different Minkowski metrics and polynomial kernels. The effect of increasing the number of nearest neighbours and marking results with significance was also investigated. SVM implementation of the Transductive Confidence Machine was compared with Nearest Neighbours implementation. The application of neural networks was investigated as a useful comparison to the transductive algorithms.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Neural Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are variational frameworks that aim to represent stochastic processes with deep neural networks. Despite their obvious benefits in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions via data-driven priors, NPs enforce network parameter sharing between the conditional prior and posterior distributions, thereby risking introducing a misspecified prior. We hereby propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP) to relax the influence of the misspecified prior and optimize a tighter bound of the marginal likelihood. More specifically, by replacing the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence between the posterior and the approximated prior, we ameliorate the impact of the misspecified prior via a parameter {\alpha} so that the resulting posterior focuses more on tail samples and reduce density on overconfident regions. Our experiments showed log-likelihood improvements on several existing NP families. We demonstrated the superior performance of our approach on various benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks. We also validate the effectiveness of RNPs on real-world tabular regression problems.</description>

      <title>Data Complexity Estimates for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a new paradigm for the data-driven approximation of nonlinear operators. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings governing the conditions for efficient operator learning remain incomplete. The present work develops theory to study the data complexity of operator learning, complementing existing research on the parametric complexity. We investigate the fundamental question: How many input/output samples are needed in operator learning to achieve a desired accuracy $\epsilon$? This question is addressed from the point of view of $n$-widths, and this work makes two key contributions. The first contribution is to derive lower bounds on $n$-widths for general classes of Lipschitz and Fr\'echet differentiable operators. These bounds rigorously demonstrate a ``curse of data-complexity'', revealing that learning on such general classes requires a sample size exponential in the inverse of the desired accuracy $\epsilon$. The second contribution of this work is to show that ``parametric efficiency'' implies ``data efficiency''; using the Fourier neural operator (FNO) as a case study, we show rigorously that on a narrower class of operators, efficiently approximated by FNO in terms of the number of tunable parameters, efficient operator learning is attainable in data complexity as well. Specifically, we show that if only an algebraically increasing number of tunable parameters is needed to reach a desired approximation accuracy, then an algebraically bounded number of data samples is also sufficient to achieve the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>Verified Safe Reinforcement Learning for Neural Network Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning reliably safe autonomous control is one of the core problems in trustworthy autonomy. However, training a controller that can be formally verified to be safe remains a major challenge. We introduce a novel approach for learning verified safe control policies in nonlinear neural dynamical systems while maximizing overall performance. Our approach aims to achieve safety in the sense of finite-horizon reachability proofs, and is comprised of three key parts. The first is a novel curriculum learning scheme that iteratively increases the verified safe horizon. The second leverages the iterative nature of gradient-based learning to leverage incremental verification, reusing information from prior verification runs. Finally, we learn multiple verified initial-state-dependent controllers, an idea that is especially valuable for more complex domains where learning a single universal verified safe controller is extremely challenging. Our experiments on five safe control problems demonstrate that our trained controllers can achieve verified safety over horizons that are as much as an order of magnitude longer than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining high reward, as well as a perfect safety record over entire episodes.</description>

      <title>Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further. This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. Similar observations are made for the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of neural network training.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic Backward Policy for GFlowNets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), which learn to sample objects proportionally to a given reward function through the trajectory of state transitions. In this work, we observe that GFlowNets tend to under-exploit the high-reward objects due to training on insufficient number of trajectories, which may lead to a large gap between the estimated flow and the (known) reward value. In response to this challenge, we propose a pessimistic backward policy for GFlowNets (PBP-GFN), which maximizes the observed flow to align closely with the true reward for the object. We extensively evaluate PBP-GFN across eight benchmarks, including hyper-grid environment, bag generation, structured set generation, molecular generation, and four RNA sequence generation tasks. In particular, PBP-GFN enhances the discovery of high-reward objects, maintains the diversity of the objects, and consistently outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence Behavior of an Adversarial Weak Supervision Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeling data via rules-of-thumb and minimal label supervision is central to Weak Supervision, a paradigm subsuming subareas of machine learning such as crowdsourced learning and semi-supervised ensemble learning. By using this labeled data to train modern machine learning methods, the cost of acquiring large amounts of hand labeled data can be ameliorated. Approaches to combining the rules-of-thumb falls into two camps, reflecting different ideologies of statistical estimation. The most common approach, exemplified by the Dawid-Skene model, is based on probabilistic modeling. The other, developed in the work of Balsubramani-Freund and others, is adversarial and game-theoretic. We provide a variety of statistical results for the adversarial approach under log-loss: we characterize the form of the solution, relate it to logistic regression, demonstrate consistency, and give rates of convergence. On the other hand, we find that probabilistic approaches for the same model class can fail to be consistent. Experimental results are provided to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Feature Protection For Out-of-distribution Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the availability of large pre-trained models, a modern workflow for building real-world machine learning solutions is to fine-tune such models on a downstream task with a relatively small domain-specific dataset. In such applications, one major challenge is that the small fine-tuning dataset does not have sufficient coverage of the distribution encountered when the model is deployed. It is thus important to design fine-tuning methods that are robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are under-represented by the training data. This paper compares common fine-tuning methods to investigate their OOD performance and demonstrates that standard methods will result in a significant change to the pre-trained model so that the fine-tuned features overfit the fine-tuning dataset. However, this causes deteriorated OOD performance. To overcome this issue, we show that protecting pre-trained features leads to a fine-tuned model more robust to OOD generalization. We validate the feature protection methods with extensive experiments of fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and DomainNet.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Allocation for Edge Intelligence with Colocated Model Retraining and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With edge intelligence, AI models are increasingly pushed to the edge to serve ubiquitous users. However, due to the drift of model, data, and task, AI model deployed at the edge suffers from degraded accuracy in the inference serving phase. Model retraining handles such drifts by periodically retraining the model with newly arrived data. When colocating model retraining and model inference serving for the same model on resource-limited edge servers, a fundamental challenge arises in balancing the resource allocation for model retraining and inference, aiming to maximize long-term inference accuracy. This problem is particularly difficult due to the underlying mathematical formulation being time-coupled, non-convex, and NP-hard. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight and explainable online approximation algorithm, named ORRIC, designed to optimize resource allocation for adaptively balancing the accuracy of model training and inference. The competitive ratio of ORRIC outperforms that of the traditional Inference-Only paradigm, especially when data drift persists for a sufficiently lengthy time. This highlights the advantages and applicable scenarios of colocating model retraining and inference. Notably, ORRIC can be translated into several heuristic algorithms for different resource environments. Experiments conducted in real scenarios validate the effectiveness of ORRIC.</description>

      <title>Constrained Ensemble Exploration for Unsupervised Skill Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising paradigm for learning useful behaviors via reward-free per-training. Existing methods for unsupervised RL mainly conduct empowerment-driven skill discovery or entropy-based exploration. However, empowerment often leads to static skills, and pure exploration only maximizes the state coverage rather than learning useful behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised RL framework via an ensemble of skills, where each skill performs partition exploration based on the state prototypes. Thus, each skill can explore the clustered area locally, and the ensemble skills maximize the overall state coverage. We adopt state-distribution constraints for the skill occupancy and the desired cluster for learning distinguishable skills. Theoretical analysis is provided for the state entropy and the resulting skill distributions. Based on extensive experiments on several challenging tasks, we find our method learns well-explored ensemble skills and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Certifying Adapters: Enabling and Enhancing the Certification of Classifier Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become a leading method for achieving certified robustness in deep classifiers against l_{p}-norm adversarial perturbations. Current approaches for achieving certified robustness, such as data augmentation with Gaussian noise and adversarial training, require expensive training procedures that tune large models for different Gaussian noise levels and thus cannot leverage high-performance pre-trained neural networks. In this work, we introduce a novel certifying adapters framework (CAF) that enables and enhances the certification of classifier adversarial robustness. Our approach makes few assumptions about the underlying training algorithm or feature extractor and is thus broadly applicable to different feature extractor architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks or vision transformers) and smoothing algorithms. We show that CAF (a) enables certification in uncertified models pre-trained on clean datasets and (b) substantially improves the performance of certified classifiers via randomized smoothing and SmoothAdv at multiple radii in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. We demonstrate that CAF achieves improved certified accuracies when compared to methods based on random or denoised smoothing, and that CAF is insensitive to certifying adapter hyperparameters. Finally, we show that an ensemble of adapters enables a single pre-trained feature extractor to defend against a range of noise perturbation scales.</description>

      <title>MoEUT: Mixture-of-Experts Universal Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on Universal Transformers (UTs) has demonstrated the importance of parameter sharing across layers. By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced "moot"), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs. The resulting UT model, for the first time, slightly outperforms standard Transformers on language modeling tasks such as BLiMP and PIQA, while using significantly less compute and memory.</description>

      <title>Explainable Molecular Property Prediction: Aligning Chemical Concepts with Predictions via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing explainable molecule property predictions is critical for many scientific domains, such as drug discovery and material science. Though transformer-based language models have shown great potential in accurate molecular property prediction, they neither provide chemically meaningful explanations nor faithfully reveal the molecular structure-property relationships. In this work, we develop a new framework for explainable molecular property prediction based on language models, dubbed as Lamole, which can provide chemical concepts-aligned explanations. We first leverage a designated molecular representation -- the Group SELFIES -- as it can provide chemically meaningful semantics. Because attention mechanisms in Transformers can inherently capture relationships within the input, we further incorporate the attention weights and gradients together to generate explanations for capturing the functional group interactions. We then carefully craft a marginal loss to explicitly optimize the explanations to be able to align with the chemists' annotations. We bridge the manifold hypothesis with the elaborated marginal loss to prove that the loss can align the explanations with the tangent space of the data manifold, leading to concept-aligned explanations. Experimental results over six mutagenicity datasets and one hepatotoxicity dataset demonstrate Lamole can achieve comparable classification accuracy and boost the explanation accuracy by up to 14.8%, being the state-of-the-art in explainable molecular property prediction.</description>

Abstract: Strong student models can learn from weaker teachers: when trained on the predictions of a weaker model, a strong pretrained student can learn to correct the weak model's errors and generalize to examples where the teacher is not confident, even when these examples are excluded from training. This enables learning from cheap, incomplete, and possibly incorrect label information, such as coarse logical rules or the generations of a language model. We show that existing weak supervision theory fails to account for both of these effects, which we call pseudolabel correction and coverage expansion, respectively. We give a new bound based on expansion properties of the data distribution and student hypothesis class that directly accounts for pseudolabel correction and coverage expansion. Our bounds capture the intuition that weak-to-strong generalization occurs when the strong model is unable to fit the mistakes of the weak teacher without incurring additional error. We show that these expansion properties can be checked from finite data and give empirical evidence that they hold in practice.</description>

      <title>Pausing Policy Learning in Non-stationary Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time inference is a challenge of real-world reinforcement learning due to temporal differences in time-varying environments: the system collects data from the past, updates the decision model in the present, and deploys it in the future. We tackle a common belief that continually updating the decision is optimal to minimize the temporal gap. We propose forecasting an online reinforcement learning framework and show that strategically pausing decision updates yields better overall performance by effectively managing aleatoric uncertainty. Theoretically, we compute an optimal ratio between policy update and hold duration, and show that a non-zero policy hold duration provides a sharper upper bound on the dynamic regret. Our experimental evaluations on three different environments also reveal that a non-zero policy hold duration yields higher rewards compared to continuous decision updates.</description>

      <title>FedSheafHN: Personalized Federated Learning on Graph-structured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized subgraph Federated Learning (FL) is a task that customizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to individual client needs, accommodating diverse data distributions. However, applying hypernetworks in FL, while aiming to facilitate model personalization, often encounters challenges due to inadequate representation of client-specific characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a model called FedSheafHN, using enhanced collaboration graph embedding and efficient personalized model parameter generation. Specifically, our model embeds each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph. We utilize sheaf diffusion in the collaboration graph to learn client representations. Our model improves the integration and interpretation of complex client characteristics. Furthermore, our model ensures the generation of personalized models through advanced hypernetworks optimized for parallel operations across clients. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing methods in most scenarios, in terms of client model performance on various graph-structured datasets. It also has fast model convergence and effective new clients generalization.</description>

      <title>IncomeSCM: From tabular data set to time-series simulator and causal estimation benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating observational estimators of causal effects demands information that is rarely available: unconfounded interventions and outcomes from the population of interest, created either by randomization or adjustment. As a result, it is customary to fall back on simulators when creating benchmark tasks. Simulators offer great control but are often too simplistic to make challenging tasks, either because they are hand-designed and lack the nuances of real-world data, or because they are fit to observational data without structural constraints. In this work, we propose a general, repeatable strategy for turning observational data into sequential structural causal models and challenging estimation tasks by following two simple principles: 1) fitting real-world data where possible, and 2) creating complexity by composing simple, hand-designed mechanisms. We implement these ideas in a highly configurable software package and apply it to the well-known Adult income data set to construct the IncomeSCM simulator. From this, we devise multiple estimation tasks and sample data sets to compare established estimators of causal effects. The tasks present a suitable challenge, with effect estimates varying greatly in quality between methods, despite similar performance in the modeling of factual outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated causal estimators and model selection criteria.</description>

      <title>Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis for Conflict-Avoidant Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) has shown great promise in many real-world applications. Existing MTRL algorithms often aim to learn a policy that optimizes individual objective functions simultaneously with a given prior preference (or weights) on different tasks. However, these methods often suffer from the issue of \textit{gradient conflict} such that the tasks with larger gradients dominate the update direction, resulting in a performance degeneration on other tasks. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic weighting multi-task actor-critic algorithm (MTAC) under two options of sub-procedures named as CA and FC in task weight updates. MTAC-CA aims to find a conflict-avoidant (CA) update direction that maximizes the minimum value improvement among tasks, and MTAC-FC targets at a much faster convergence rate. We provide a comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis for both algorithms. We show that MTAC-CA can find a $\epsilon+\epsilon_{\text{app}}$-accurate Pareto stationary policy using $\mathcal{O}({\epsilon^{-5}})$ samples, while ensuring a small $\epsilon+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\text{app}}}$-level CA distance (defined as the distance to the CA direction), where $\epsilon_{\text{app}}$ is the function approximation error. The analysis also shows that MTAC-FC improves the sample complexity to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$, but with a constant-level CA distance. Our experiments on MT10 demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms over existing MTRL methods with fixed preference.</description>

      <title>From Orthogonality to Dependency: Learning Disentangled Representation for Multi-Modal Time-Series Sensing Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for multi-modal time series representation learning aim to disentangle the modality-shared and modality-specific latent variables. Although achieving notable performances on downstream tasks, they usually assume an orthogonal latent space. However, the modality-specific and modality-shared latent variables might be dependent on real-world scenarios. Therefore, we propose a general generation process, where the modality-shared and modality-specific latent variables are dependent, and further develop a \textbf{M}ulti-mod\textbf{A}l \textbf{TE}mporal Disentanglement (\textbf{MATE}) model. Specifically, our \textbf{MATE} model is built on a temporally variational inference architecture with the modality-shared and modality-specific prior networks for the disentanglement of latent variables. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results to show that the extracted representation is disentangled. More specifically, we first achieve the subspace identifiability for modality-shared and modality-specific latent variables by leveraging the pairing of multi-modal data. Then we establish the component-wise identifiability of modality-specific latent variables by employing sufficient changes of historical latent variables. Extensive experimental studies on multi-modal sensors, human activity recognition, and healthcare datasets show a general improvement in different downstream tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Convergence Analysis of Score-based Generative Models via Sharp Lipschitz Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish global well-posedness and convergence of the score-based generative models (SGM) under minimal general assumptions of initial data for score estimation. For the smooth case, we start from a Lipschitz bound of the score function with optimal time length. The optimality is validated by an example whose Lipschitz constant of scores is bounded at initial but blows up in finite time. This necessitates the separation of time scales in conventional bounds for non-log-concave distributions. In contrast, our follow up analysis only relies on a local Lipschitz condition and is valid globally in time. This leads to the convergence of numerical scheme without time separation. For the non-smooth case, we show that the optimal Lipschitz bound is O(1/t) in the point-wise sense for distributions supported on a compact, smooth and low-dimensional manifold with boundary.</description>

      <title>Enabling On-Device Learning via Experience Replay with Efficient Dataset Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon deployment to edge devices, it is often desirable for a model to further learn from streaming data to improve accuracy. However, extracting representative features from such data is challenging because it is typically unlabeled, non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d), and is seen only once. To mitigate this issue, a common strategy is to maintain a small data buffer on the edge device to hold the most representative data for further learning. As most data is either never stored or quickly discarded, identifying the most representative data to avoid significant information loss becomes critical. In this paper, we propose an on-device framework that addresses this issue by condensing incoming data into more informative samples. Specifically, to effectively handle unlabeled incoming data, we propose a pseudo-labeling technique designed for unlabeled on-device learning environments. Additionally, we develop a dataset condensation technique that only requires little computation resources. To counteract the effects of noisy labels during the condensation process, we further utilize a contrastive learning objective to improve the purity of class data within the buffer. Our empirical results indicate substantial improvements over existing methods, particularly when buffer capacity is severely restricted. For instance, with a buffer capacity of just one sample per class, our method achieves an accuracy that outperforms the best existing baseline by 58.4% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>Beyond Primal-Dual Methods in Bandits with Stochastic and Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a generalization of the bandit with knapsacks problem, where a learner aims to maximize rewards while satisfying an arbitrary set of long-term constraints. Our goal is to design best-of-both-worlds algorithms that perform optimally under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. Previous works address this problem via primal-dual methods, and require some stringent assumptions, namely the Slater's condition, and in adversarial settings, they either assume knowledge of a lower bound on the Slater's parameter, or impose strong requirements on the primal and dual regret minimizers such as requiring weak adaptivity. We propose an alternative and more natural approach based on optimistic estimations of the constraints. Surprisingly, we show that estimating the constraints with an UCB-like approach guarantees optimal performances. Our algorithm consists of two main components: (i) a regret minimizer working on \emph{moving strategy sets} and (ii) an estimate of the feasible set as an optimistic weighted empirical mean of previous samples. The key challenge in this approach is designing adaptive weights that meet the different requirements for stochastic and adversarial constraints. Our algorithm is significantly simpler than previous approaches, and has a cleaner analysis. Moreover, ours is the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm providing bounds logarithmic in the number of constraints. Additionally, in stochastic settings, it provides $\widetilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret \emph{without} Slater's condition.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Meta-Learning via In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised meta-learning aims to learn feature representations from unsupervised datasets that can transfer to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to unsupervised meta-learning that leverages the generalization abilities of in-context learning observed in transformer architectures. Our method reframes meta-learning as a sequence modeling problem, enabling the transformer encoder to learn task context from support images and utilize it to predict query images. At the core of our approach lies the creation of diverse tasks generated using a combination of data augmentations and a mixing strategy that challenges the model during training while fostering generalization to unseen tasks at test time. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including miniImageNet, CIFAR-fs, CUB, and Aircraft, showcase the superiority of our approach over existing unsupervised meta-learning baselines, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art in the field. Remarkably, our method achieves competitive results with supervised and self-supervised approaches, underscoring the efficacy of the model in leveraging generalization over memorization.</description>

      <title>Automating the Selection of Proxy Variables of Unmeasured Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, interest has grown in the use of proxy variables of unobserved confounding for inferring the causal effect in the presence of unmeasured confounders from observational data. One difficulty inhibiting the practical use is finding valid proxy variables of unobserved confounding to a target causal effect of interest. These proxy variables are typically justified by background knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the estimation of causal effects among multiple treatments and a single outcome, all of which are affected by unmeasured confounders, within a linear causal model, without prior knowledge of the validity of proxy variables. To be more specific, we first extend the existing proxy variable estimator, originally addressing a single unmeasured confounder, to accommodate scenarios where multiple unmeasured confounders exist between the treatments and the outcome. Subsequently, we present two different sets of precise identifiability conditions for selecting valid proxy variables of unmeasured confounders, based on the second-order statistics and higher-order statistics of the data, respectively. Moreover, we propose two data-driven methods for the selection of proxy variables and for the unbiased estimation of causal effects. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the correctness of our proposed algorithms. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>AIGB: Generative Auto-bidding via Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-bidding plays a crucial role in facilitating online advertising by automatically providing bids for advertisers. Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained popularity for auto-bidding. However, most current RL auto-bidding methods are modeled through the Markovian Decision Process (MDP), which assumes the Markovian state transition. This assumption restricts the ability to perform in long horizon scenarios and makes the model unstable when dealing with highly random online advertising environments. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), a novel paradigm for auto-bidding through generative modeling. In this paradigm, we propose DiffBid, a conditional diffusion modeling approach for bid generation. DiffBid directly models the correlation between the return and the entire trajectory, effectively avoiding error propagation across time steps in long horizons. Additionally, DiffBid offers a versatile approach for generating trajectories that maximize given targets while adhering to specific constraints. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffBid, achieving 2.81% increase in GMV and 3.36% increase in ROI.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Transformers with Spectrum-Preserving Token Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the throughput of the Transformer architecture, a foundational component used in numerous state-of-the-art models for vision and language tasks (e.g., GPT, LLaVa), is an important problem in machine learning. One recent and effective strategy is to merge token representations within Transformer models, aiming to reduce computational and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. Prior works have proposed algorithms based on Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM), which divides tokens into distinct sets and merges the top k similar tokens. However, these methods have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to token-splitting strategies and damage to informative tokens in later layers. This paper presents a novel paradigm called PiToMe, which prioritizes the preservation of informative tokens using an additional metric termed the energy score. This score identifies large clusters of similar tokens as high-energy, indicating potential candidates for merging, while smaller (unique and isolated) clusters are considered as low-energy and preserved. Experimental findings demonstrate that PiToMe saved from 40-60\% FLOPs of the base models while exhibiting superior off-the-shelf performance on image classification (0.5\% average performance drop of ViT-MAE-H compared to 2.6\% as baselines), image-text retrieval (0.3\% average performance drop of CLIP on Flickr30k compared to 4.5\% as others), and analogously in visual questions answering with LLaVa-7B. Furthermore, PiToMe is theoretically shown to preserve intrinsic spectral properties of the original token space under mild conditions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent benchmarks found In-Context Learning (ICL) outperforms both deep learning and tree-based algorithms on small tabular datasets. However, on larger datasets, ICL for tabular learning cannot run without severely compromising performance, due to its quadratic space and time complexity w.r.t. dataset size. We propose MIXTUREPFN, which both extends nearest-neighbor sampling to the state-of-the-art ICL for tabular learning model and uses bootstrapping to finetune said model on the inference-time dataset. MIXTUREPFN is the Condorcet winner across 36 diverse tabular datasets against 19 strong deep learning and tree-based baselines, achieving the highest mean rank among Top-10 aforementioned algorithms with statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Bigger, Regularized, Optimistic: scaling for compute and sample-efficient continuous control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has traditionally been driven by algorithmic enhancements. In this work, we demonstrate that scaling can also lead to substantial improvements. We conduct a thorough investigation into the interplay of scaling model capacity and domain-specific RL enhancements. These empirical findings inform the design choices underlying our proposed BRO (Bigger, Regularized, Optimistic) algorithm. The key innovation behind BRO is that strong regularization allows for effective scaling of the critic networks, which, paired with optimistic exploration, leads to superior performance. BRO achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming the leading model-based and model-free algorithms across 40 complex tasks from the DeepMind Control, MetaWorld, and MyoSuite benchmarks. BRO is the first model-free algorithm to achieve near-optimal policies in the notoriously challenging Dog and Humanoid tasks.</description>

      <title>A Declarative Query Language for Scientific Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: The popularity of data science as a discipline and its importance in the emerging economy and industrial progress dictate that machine learning be democratized for the masses. This also means that the current practice of workforce training using machine learning tools, which requires low-level statistical and algorithmic details, is a barrier that needs to be addressed. Similar to data management languages such as SQL, machine learning needs to be practiced at a conceptual level to help make it a staple tool for general users. In particular, the technical sophistication demanded by existing machine learning frameworks is prohibitive for many scientists who are not computationally savvy or well versed in machine learning techniques. The learning curve to use the needed machine learning tools is also too high for them to take advantage of these powerful platforms to rapidly advance science. In this paper, we introduce a new declarative machine learning query language, called {\em MQL}, for naive users. We discuss its merit and possible ways of implementing it over a traditional relational database system. We discuss two materials science experiments implemented using MQL on a materials science workflow system called MatFlow.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Better Load Estimates by Combining Anomaly and Change-point Detection in Power Grid Time-series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present novel methodology for automatic anomaly and switch event filtering to improve load estimation in power grid systems. By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player Approaches for Dueling Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various approaches have emerged for multi-armed bandits in distributed systems. The multiplayer dueling bandit problem, common in scenarios with only preference-based information like human feedback, introduces challenges related to controlling collaborative exploration of non-informative arm pairs, but has received little attention. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that the direct use of a Follow Your Leader black-box approach matches the lower bound for this setting when utilizing known dueling bandit algorithms as a foundation. Additionally, we analyze a message-passing fully distributed approach with a novel Condorcet-winner recommendation protocol, resulting in expedited exploration in many cases. Our experimental comparisons reveal that our multiplayer algorithms surpass single-player benchmark algorithms, underscoring their efficacy in addressing the nuanced challenges of the multiplayer dueling bandit setting.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies, and providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on the application of diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL is less investigated. The training objective of the diffusion model, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be optimized directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' actions. This leads to difficulties in conducting diffusion policy improvement. To overcome this, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm, Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss, which can be proved to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective in online RL under certain conditions. To fulfill these conditions, the Q-weight transformation functions are introduced for general scenarios. Additionally, to further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. We also develop an efficient behavior policy to enhance sample efficiency by reducing the variance of the diffusion policy during online interactions. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on both cumulative reward and sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural PDE Solvers with Conservation and Similarity-Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches, as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges, this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs), which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the model's inclusion of physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade.

      <title>Differentiable Cluster Graph Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks often struggle with long-range information propagation and in the presence of heterophilous neighborhoods. We address both challenges with a unified framework that incorporates a clustering inductive bias into the message passing mechanism, using additional cluster-nodes. Central to our approach is the formulation of an optimal transport based implicit clustering objective function. However, the algorithm for solving the implicit objective function needs to be differentiable to enable end-to-end learning of the GNN. To facilitate this, we adopt an entropy regularized objective function and propose an iterative optimization process, alternating between solving for the cluster assignments and updating the node/cluster-node embeddings. Notably, our derived closed-form optimization steps are themselves simple yet elegant message passing steps operating seamlessly on a bipartite graph of nodes and cluster-nodes. Our clustering-based approach can effectively capture both local and global information, demonstrated by extensive experiments on both heterophilous and homophilous datasets.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, this work proposes Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more precise and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator; then, we design diffusion rewards based on the classifier's output for policy learning. We conduct extensive experiments in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL's effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more precise and smoother rewards.</description>

      <title>Adaptive $Q$-Network: On-the-fly Target Selection for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is well known for being highly sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring practitioners substantial efforts to optimize them for the problem at hand. In recent years, the field of automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) has grown in popularity by trying to address this issue. However, these approaches typically hinge on additional samples to select well-performing hyperparameters, hindering sample-efficiency and practicality in RL. Furthermore, most AutoRL methods are heavily based on already existing AutoML methods, which were originally developed neglecting the additional challenges inherent to RL due to its non-stationarities. In this work, we propose a new approach for AutoRL, called Adaptive $Q$-Network (AdaQN), that is tailored to RL to take into account the non-stationarity of the optimization procedure without requiring additional samples. AdaQN learns several $Q$-functions, each one trained with different hyperparameters, which are updated online using the $Q$-function with the smallest approximation error as a shared target. Our selection scheme simultaneously handles different hyperparameters while coping with the non-stationarity induced by the RL optimization procedure and being orthogonal to any critic-based RL algorithm. We demonstrate that AdaQN is theoretically sound and empirically validate it in MuJoCo control problems, showing benefits in sample-efficiency, overall performance, training stability, and robustness to stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Maintaining and Managing Road Quality:Using MLP and DNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor roads are a major issue for cars, drivers, and pedestrians since they are a major cause of vehicle damage and can occasionally be quite dangerous for both groups of people (pedestrians and drivers), this makes road surface condition monitoring systems essential for traffic safety, reducing accident rates ad also protecting vehicles from getting damaged. The primary objective is to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify road conditions into four categories: good, satisfactory, poor, and very poor, using a Kaggle dataset of road images. To address this, we implemented a variety of machine learning approaches. Firstly, a baseline model was created using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implemented from scratch. Secondly, a more sophisticated Deep Neural Network (DNN) was constructed using Keras. Additionally, we developed a Logistic Regression model from scratch to compare performance. Finally, a wide model incorporating extensive feature engineering was built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with sklearn.The study compared different models for image-based road quality assessment. Deep learning models, the DNN with Keras achieved the best accuracy, while the baseline MLP provided a solid foundation. The Logistic Regression although it is simpler, but it provided interpretability and insights into important features. The KNN model, with the help of feature engineering, achieved the best results. The research shows that machine learning can automate road condition monitoring, saving time and money on maintenance. The next step is to improve these models and test them in real cities, which will make our cities better managed and safer.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Large Language Model for Automated Feature Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature transformation aims to reconstruct the feature space of raw features to enhance the performance of downstream models. However, the exponential growth in the combinations of features and operations poses a challenge, making it difficult for existing methods to efficiently explore a wide space. Additionally, their optimization is solely driven by the accuracy of downstream models in specific domains, neglecting the acquisition of general feature knowledge. To fill this research gap, we propose an evolutionary LLM framework for automated feature transformation. This framework consists of two parts: 1) constructing a multi-population database through an RL data collector while utilizing evolutionary algorithm strategies for database maintenance, and 2) utilizing the ability of Large Language Model (LLM) in sequence understanding, we employ few-shot prompts to guide LLM in generating superior samples based on feature transformation sequence distinction. Leveraging the multi-population database initially provides a wide search scope to discover excellent populations. Through culling and evolution, the high-quality populations are afforded greater opportunities, thereby furthering the pursuit of optimal individuals. Through the integration of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, we achieve efficient exploration within a vast space, while harnessing feature knowledge to propel optimization, thus realizing a more adaptable search paradigm. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>GlycanML: A Multi-Task and Multi-Structure Benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glycans are basic biomolecules and perform essential functions within living organisms. The rapid increase of functional glycan data provides a good opportunity for machine learning solutions to glycan understanding. However, there still lacks a standard machine learning benchmark for glycan function prediction. In this work, we fill this blank by building a comprehensive benchmark for Glycan Machine Learning (GlycanML). The GlycanML benchmark consists of diverse types of tasks including glycan taxonomy prediction, glycan immunogenicity prediction, glycosylation type prediction, and protein-glycan interaction prediction. Glycans can be represented by both sequences and graphs in GlycanML, which enables us to extensively evaluate sequence-based models and graph neural networks (GNNs) on benchmark tasks. Furthermore, by concurrently performing eight glycan taxonomy prediction tasks, we introduce the GlycanML-MTL testbed for multi-task learning (MTL) algorithms. Experimental results show the superiority of modeling glycans with multi-relational GNNs, and suitable MTL methods can further boost model performance. We provide all datasets and source codes at https://github.com/GlycanML/GlycanML and maintain a leaderboard at https://GlycanML.github.io/project</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating data with properties of interest by external users while following the right causation among its intrinsic factors is important yet has not been well addressed jointly. This is due to the long-lasting challenge of jointly identifying key latent variables, their causal relations, and their correlation with properties of interest, as well as how to leverage their discoveries toward causally controlled data generation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep generative framework called the Correlation-aware Causal Variational Auto-encoder (C2VAE). This framework simultaneously recovers the correlation and causal relationships between properties using disentangled latent vectors. Specifically, causality is captured by learning the causal graph on latent variables through a structural causal model, while correlation is learned via a novel correlation pooling algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate C2VAE's ability to accurately recover true causality and correlation, as well as its superiority in controllable data generation compared to baseline models.</description>

      <title>Negative as Positive: Enhancing Out-of-distribution Generalization for Graph Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL), standing as the dominant paradigm in the realm of graph pre-training, has yielded considerable progress. Nonetheless, its capacity for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we point out that the traditional optimization of InfoNCE in GCL restricts the cross-domain pairs only to be negative samples, which inevitably enlarges the distribution gap between different domains. This violates the requirement of domain invariance under OOD scenario and consequently impairs the model's OOD generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy "Negative as Positive", where the most semantically similar cross-domain negative pairs are treated as positive during GCL. Our experimental results, spanning a wide array of datasets, confirm that this method substantially improves the OOD generalization performance of GCL.</description>

      <title>Local Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering causal relationships from observational data, particularly in the presence of latent variables, poses a challenging problem. While current local structure learning methods have proven effective and efficient when the focus lies solely on the local relationships of a target variable, they operate under the assumption of causal sufficiency. This assumption implies that all the common causes of the measured variables are observed, leaving no room for latent variables. Such a premise can be easily violated in various real-world applications, resulting in inaccurate structures that may adversely impact downstream tasks. In light of this, our paper delves into the primary investigation of locally identifying potential parents and children of a target from observational data that may include latent variables. Specifically, we harness the causal information from m-separation and V-structures to derive theoretical consistency results, effectively bridging the gap between global and local structure learning. Together with the newly developed stop rules, we present a principled method for determining whether a variable is a direct cause or effect of a target. Further, we theoretically demonstrate the correctness of our approach under the standard causal Markov and faithfulness conditions, with infinite samples. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Client2Vec: Improving Federated Learning by Distribution Shifts Aware Client Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning paradigm. Nonetheless, the substantial distribution shifts among clients pose a considerable challenge to the performance of current FL algorithms. To mitigate this challenge, various methods have been proposed to enhance the FL training process. This paper endeavors to tackle the issue of data heterogeneity from another perspective -- by improving FL algorithms prior to the actual training stage. Specifically, we introduce the Client2Vec mechanism, which generates a unique client index for each client before the commencement of FL training. Subsequently, we leverage the generated client index to enhance the subsequent FL training process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Client2Vec method, we conduct three case studies that assess the impact of the client index on the FL training process. These case studies encompass enhanced client sampling, model aggregation, and local training. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets and model architectures show the efficacy of Client2Vec across all three case studies. Our code is avaliable at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/client2vec}.</description>

      <title>Analytic Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce analytic federated learning (AFL), a new training paradigm that brings analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions to the federated learning (FL) community. Our AFL draws inspiration from analytic learning -- a gradient-free technique that trains neural networks with analytical solutions in one epoch. In the local client training stage, the AFL facilitates a one-epoch training, eliminating the necessity for multi-epoch updates. In the aggregation stage, we derive an absolute aggregation (AA) law. This AA law allows a single-round aggregation, removing the need for multiple aggregation rounds. More importantly, the AFL exhibits a \textit{weight-invariant} property, meaning that regardless of how the full dataset is distributed among clients, the aggregated result remains identical. This could spawn various potentials, such as data heterogeneity invariance, client-number invariance, absolute convergence, and being hyperparameter-free (our AFL is the first hyperparameter-free method in FL history). We conduct experiments across various FL settings including extremely non-IID ones, and scenarios with a large number of clients (e.g., $\ge 1000$). In all these settings, our AFL constantly performs competitively while existing FL techniques encounter various obstacles.

      <description>arXiv:2405.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adam optimization method has achieved remarkable success in addressing contemporary challenges in stochastic optimization. This method falls within the realm of adaptive sub-gradient techniques, yet the underlying geometric principles guiding its performance have remained shrouded in mystery, and have long confounded researchers. In this paper, we introduce GeoAdaLer (Geometric Adaptive Learner), a novel adaptive learning method for stochastic gradient descent optimization, which draws from the geometric properties of the optimization landscape. Beyond emerging as a formidable contender, the proposed method extends the concept of adaptive learning by introducing a geometrically inclined approach that enhances the interpretability and effectiveness in complex optimization scenarios</description>

      <title>USD: Unsupervised Soft Contrastive Learning for Fault Detection in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series is critical for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of complex systems, with current methodologies largely focusing on statistical and machine learning techniques. However, these approaches often rest on the assumption that data distributions conform to Gaussian models, overlooking the diversity of patterns that can manifest in both normal and abnormal states, thereby diminishing discriminative performance. Our innovation addresses this limitation by introducing a combination of data augmentation and soft contrastive learning, specifically designed to capture the multifaceted nature of state behaviors more accurately. The data augmentation process enriches the dataset with varied representations of normal states, while soft contrastive learning fine-tunes the model's sensitivity to the subtle differences between normal and abnormal patterns, enabling it to recognize a broader spectrum of anomalies. This dual strategy significantly boosts the model's ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal states, leading to a marked improvement in fault detection performance across multiple datasets and settings, thereby setting a new benchmark for unsupervised fault detection in complex systems. The code of our method is available at \url{https://github.com/zangzelin/code_USD.git}.</description>

      <title>Layer-Aware Analysis of Catastrophic Overfitting: Revealing the Pseudo-Robust Shortcut Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic overfitting (CO) presents a significant challenge in single-step adversarial training (AT), manifesting as highly distorted deep neural networks (DNNs) that are vulnerable to multi-step adversarial attacks. However, the underlying factors that lead to the distortion of decision boundaries remain unclear. In this work, we delve into the specific changes within different DNN layers and discover that during CO, the former layers are more susceptible, experiencing earlier and greater distortion, while the latter layers show relative insensitivity. Our analysis further reveals that this increased sensitivity in former layers stems from the formation of pseudo-robust shortcuts, which alone can impeccably defend against single-step adversarial attacks but bypass genuine-robust learning, resulting in distorted decision boundaries. Eliminating these shortcuts can partially restore robustness in DNNs from the CO state, thereby verifying that dependence on them triggers the occurrence of CO. This understanding motivates us to implement adaptive weight perturbations across different layers to hinder the generation of pseudo-robust shortcuts, consequently mitigating CO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, Layer-Aware Adversarial Weight Perturbation (LAP), can effectively prevent CO and further enhance robustness.</description>

      <title>MindStar: Enhancing Math Reasoning in Pre-trained LLMs at Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various tasks, they often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, such as answering mathematical questions. Recent efforts to address this issue have primarily focused on leveraging mathematical datasets through supervised fine-tuning or self-improvement techniques. However, these methods often depend on high-quality datasets that are difficult to prepare, or they require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning. Inspired by findings that LLMs know how to produce right answer but struggle to select the correct reasoning path, we propose a purely inference-based searching method called MindStar (M*), which treats reasoning tasks as search problems. This method utilizes a step-wise reasoning approach to navigate the tree space. To enhance search efficiency, we propose two tree-search ideas to identify the optimal reasoning paths. We evaluate the M* framework on both the GSM8K and MATH datasets, comparing its performance with existing open and closed-source LLMs. Our results demonstrate that M* significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of open-source models, such as Llama-2-13B and Mistral-7B, and achieves comparable performance to GPT-3.5 and Grok-1, but with substantially reduced model size and computational costs.</description>

      <title>A GPU-Accelerated Bi-linear ADMM Algorithm for Distributed Sparse Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Bi-linear consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (Bi-cADMM), aimed at solving large-scale regularized Sparse Machine Learning (SML) problems defined over a network of computational nodes. Mathematically, these are stated as minimization problems with convex local loss functions over a global decision vector, subject to an explicit $\ell_0$ norm constraint to enforce the desired sparsity. The considered SML problem generalizes different sparse regression and classification models, such as sparse linear and logistic regression, sparse softmax regression, and sparse support vector machines. Bi-cADMM leverages a bi-linear consensus reformulation of the original non-convex SML problem and a hierarchical decomposition strategy that divides the problem into smaller sub-problems amenable to parallel computing. In Bi-cADMM, this decomposition strategy is based on a two-phase approach. Initially, it performs a sample decomposition of the data and distributes local datasets across computational nodes. Subsequently, a delayed feature decomposition of the data is conducted on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) available to each node. This methodology allows Bi-cADMM to undertake computationally intensive data-centric computations on GPUs, while CPUs handle more cost-effective computations. The proposed algorithm is implemented within an open-source Python package called Parallel Sparse Fitting Toolbox (PsFiT), which is publicly available. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm through numerical benchmarks across various SML problems featuring distributed datasets.</description>

      <title>ModelLock: Locking Your Model With a Spell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model protection paradigm ModelLock that locks (destroys) the performance of a model on normal clean data so as to make it unusable or unextractable without the right key. Specifically, we proposed a diffusion-based framework dubbed ModelLock that explores text-guided image editing to transform the training data into unique styles or add new objects in the background. A model finetuned on this edited dataset will be locked and can only be unlocked by the key prompt, i.e., the text prompt used to transform the data. We conduct extensive experiments on both image classification and segmentation tasks, and show that 1) ModelLock can effectively lock the finetuned models without significantly reducing the expected performance, and more importantly, 2) the locked model cannot be easily unlocked without knowing both the key prompt and the diffusion model. Our work opens up a new direction for intellectual property protection of private models.</description>

      <title>Generation of synthetic data using breast cancer dataset and classification with resnet18</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since technology is advancing so quickly in the modern era of information, data is becoming an essential resource in many fields. Correct data collection, organization, and analysis make it a potent tool for successful decision-making, process improvement, and success across a wide range of sectors. Synthetic data is required for a number of reasons, including the constraints of real data, the expense of collecting labeled data, and privacy and security problems in specific situations and domains. For a variety of reasons, including security, ethics, legal restrictions, sensitivity and privacy issues, and ethics, synthetic data is a valuable tool, particularly in the health sector. A deep learning model called GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) has been developed with the intention of generating synthetic data. In this study, the Breast Histopathology dataset was used to generate malignant and negatively labeled synthetic patch images using MSG-GAN (Multi-Scale Gradients for Generative Adversarial Networks), a form of GAN, to aid in cancer identification. After that, the ResNet18 model was used to classify both synthetic and real data via Transfer Learning. Following the investigation, an attempt was made to ascertain whether the synthetic images behaved like the real data or if they are comparable to the original data.</description>

      <title>LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .</description>

      <title>LUCIE: A Lightweight Uncoupled ClImate Emulator with long-term stability and physical consistency for O(1000)-member ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LUCIE, a $1000$- member ensemble data-driven atmospheric emulator that remains stable during autoregressive inference for thousands of years without a drifting climatology. LUCIE has been trained on $9.5$ years of coarse-resolution ERA5 data with $4$ prognostic variables on a single A100 GPU for $2.4$ h. Owing to the cheap computational cost of inference, $1000$ model ensembles are executed for $5$ years to compute an uncertainty-quantified climatology for the prognostic variables that closely match the climatology obtained from ERA5. Unlike all the other state-of-the-art AI weather models, LUCIE is neither unstable nor does it produce hallucinations that result in unphysical drift of the emulated climate. Furthermore, LUCIE \textbf{does not impose} ``true" sea-surface temperature (SST) from a coupled numerical model to enforce the annual cycle in temperature. We demonstrate the long-term climatology obtained from LUCIE as well as subseasonal-to-seasonal scale prediction skills on the prognostic variables. We also demonstrate a $20$-year emulation with LUCIE here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRmhx9RRGiF3uGo_mRQK8RpwQatrCiMn/view</description>

      <title>Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization using Global and Local Alignment of Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of federated domain generalization in an unsupervised setting for the first time. We first theoretically establish a connection between domain shift and alignment of gradients in unsupervised federated learning and show that aligning the gradients at both client and server levels can facilitate the generalization of the model to new (target) domains. Building on this insight, we propose a novel method named FedGaLA, which performs gradient alignment at the client level to encourage clients to learn domain-invariant features, as well as global gradient alignment at the server to obtain a more generalized aggregated model. To empirically evaluate our method, we perform various experiments on four commonly used multi-domain datasets, PACS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method which outperforms comparable baselines. Ablation and sensitivity studies demonstrate the impact of different components and parameters in our approach. The source code will be available online upon publication.</description>

Abstract: Metriplectic systems are learned from data in a way that scales quadratically in both the size of the state and the rank of the metriplectic data. Besides being provably energy conserving and entropy stable, the proposed approach comes with approximation results demonstrating its ability to accurately learn metriplectic dynamics from data as well as an error estimate indicating its potential for generalization to unseen timescales when approximation error is low. Examples are provided which illustrate performance in the presence of both full state information as well as when entropic variables are unknown, confirming that the proposed approach exhibits superior accuracy and scalability without compromising on model expressivity.</description>

      <title>Time-SSM: Simplifying and Unifying State Space Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a potent tool in sequence modeling tasks in recent years. These models approximate continuous systems using a set of basis functions and discretize them to handle input data, making them well-suited for modeling time series data collected at specific frequencies from continuous systems. Despite its potential, the application of SSMs in time series forecasting remains underexplored, with most existing models treating SSMs as a black box for capturing temporal or channel dependencies. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel theoretical framework termed Dynamic Spectral Operator, offering more intuitive and general guidance on applying SSMs to time series data. Building upon our theory, we introduce Time-SSM, a novel SSM-based foundation model with only one-seventh of the parameters compared to Mamba. Various experiments validate both our theoretical framework and the superior performance of Time-SSM.</description>

      <title>SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-Rank Adapter Pretraining of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SLoPe, a Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-rank Adapter Pretraining method for LLMs that improves the accuracy of sparse LLMs while accelerating their pretraining and inference and reducing their memory footprint. Sparse pretraining of LLMs reduces the accuracy of the model, to overcome this, prior work uses dense models during fine-tuning. SLoPe improves the accuracy of sparsely pretrained models by adding low-rank adapters in the final 1% iterations of pretraining without adding significant overheads to the model pretraining and inference. In addition, SLoPe uses a double-pruned backward pass formulation that prunes the transposed weight matrix using N:M sparsity structures to enable an accelerated sparse backward pass. SLoPe accelerates the training and inference of models with billions of parameters up to $1.14\times$ and $1.34\times$ respectively (OPT-33B and OPT-66B) while reducing their memory usage by up to $0.77\times$ and $0.51\times$ for training and inference respectively.</description>

      <title>LDPKiT: Recovering Utility in LDP Schemes by Training with Noise^2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of large cloud-based models for inference has been hampered by concerns about the privacy leakage of end-user data. One method to mitigate this leakage is to add local differentially private noise to queries before sending them to the cloud, but this degrades utility as a side effect. Our key insight is that knowledge available in the noisy labels returned from performing inference on noisy inputs can be aggregated and used to recover the correct labels. We implement this insight in LDPKiT, which stands for Local Differentially-Private and Utility-Preserving Inference via Knowledge Transfer. LDPKiT uses the noisy labels returned from querying a set of noised inputs to train a local model (noise^2), which is then used to perform inference on the original set of inputs. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CARER NLP datasets demonstrate that LDPKiT can improve utility without compromising privacy. For instance, on CIFAR-10, compared to a standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=15$, which provides a weak privacy guarantee, LDPKiT can achieve nearly the same accuracy (within 1% drop) with $\epsilon=7$, offering an enhanced privacy guarantee. Moreover, the benefits of using LDPKiT increase at higher, more privacy-protective noise levels. For Fashion-MNIST and CARER, LDPKiT's accuracy on the sensitive dataset with $\epsilon=7$ not only exceeds the average accuracy of the standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=7$ by roughly 20% and 9% but also outperforms the standard $\epsilon$-LDP scheme with $\epsilon=15$, a scenario with less noise and minimal privacy protection. We also perform Zest distance measurements to demonstrate that the type of distillation performed by LDPKiT is different from a model extraction attack.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open set anomaly detection (OSAD) is a crucial task that aims to identify abnormal patterns or behaviors in data sets, especially when the anomalies observed during training do not represent all possible classes of anomalies. The recent advances in quantum computing in handling complex data structures and improving machine learning models herald a paradigm shift in anomaly detection methodologies. This study proposes a Quantum Scoring Module (Qsco), embedding quantum variational circuits into neural networks to enhance the model's processing capabilities in handling uncertainty and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments conducted across eight real-world anomaly detection datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance in detecting anomalies across varied settings and reveal that integrating quantum simulators does not result in prohibitive time complexities. Our study validates the feasibility of quantum-enhanced anomaly detection methods in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Inhomogeneous Quantum Resource Scheduling with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum information science and technology is achieving real-time estimation and feedforward control of quantum systems. This challenge is compounded by the inherent inhomogeneity of quantum resources, such as qubit properties and controls, and their intrinsically probabilistic nature. This leads to stochastic challenges in error detection and probabilistic outcomes in processes such as heralded remote entanglement. Given these complexities, optimizing the construction of quantum resource states is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we address the quantum resource scheduling issue by formulating the problem and simulating it within a digitized environment, allowing the exploration and development of agent-based optimization strategies. We employ reinforcement learning agents within this probabilistic setting and introduce a new framework utilizing a Transformer model that emphasizes self-attention mechanisms for pairs of qubits. This approach facilitates dynamic scheduling by providing real-time, next-step guidance. Our method significantly improves the performance of quantum systems, achieving more than a 3$\times$ improvement over rule-based agents, and establishes an innovative framework that improves the joint design of physical and control systems for quantum applications in communication, networking, and computing.</description>

      <title>Trivialized Momentum Facilitates Diffusion Generative Modeling on Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generative modeling of data on manifold is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates to a new momentum variable that stays in a simple $\textbf{fixed vector space}$. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets. We also, arguably for the first time, tackle the generation of data on high-dimensional Special Orthogonal and Unitary groups, the latter essential for quantum problems.</description>

      <title>Rewarded Region Replay (R3) for Policy Learning with Discrete Action Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new on-policy algorithm called Rewarded Region Replay (R3), which significantly improves on PPO in solving environments with discrete action spaces. R3 improves sample efficiency by using a replay buffer which contains past successful trajectories with reward above a certain threshold, which are used to update a PPO agent with importance sampling. Crucially, we discard the importance sampling factors which are above a certain ratio to reduce variance and stabilize training. We found that R3 significantly outperforms PPO in Minigrid environments with sparse rewards and discrete action space, such as DoorKeyEnv and CrossingEnv, and moreover we found that the improvement margin of our method versus baseline PPO increases with the complexity of the environment. We also benchmarked the performance of R3 against DDQN (Double Deep Q-Network), which is a standard baseline in off-policy methods for discrete actions, and found that R3 also outperforms DDQN agent in DoorKeyEnv. Lastly, we adapt the idea of R3 to dense reward setting to obtain the Dense R3 algorithm (or DR3) and benchmarked it against PPO on Cartpole-V1 environment. We found that DR3 outperforms PPO significantly on this dense reward environment. Our code can be found at https://github.com/chry-santhemum/R3.</description>

      <title>Variational Offline Multi-agent Skill Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skills are effective temporal abstractions established for sequential decision making tasks, which enable efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks and facilitate multi-task learning through their transferability. Despite extensive research, research gaps remain in multi-agent scenarios, particularly for automatically extracting subgroup coordination patterns in a multi-agent task. In this case, we propose two novel auto-encoder schemes: VO-MASD-3D and VO-MASD-Hier, to simultaneously capture subgroup- and temporal-level abstractions and form multi-agent skills, which firstly solves the aforementioned challenge. An essential algorithm component of these schemes is a dynamic grouping function that can automatically detect latent subgroups based on agent interactions in a task. Notably, our method can be applied to offline multi-task data, and the discovered subgroup skills can be transferred across relevant tasks without retraining. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft tasks indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods regarding applying skills in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Moreover, skills discovered using our method can effectively reduce the learning difficulty in MARL scenarios with delayed and sparse reward signals.</description>

      <title>When does compositional structure yield compositional generalization? A kernel theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations are essential for this; however, the conditions under which they yield compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a general theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, potentially nonlinear representations (which also applies to neural networks in the "lazy regime"). We prove that these models are functionally limited to adding up values assigned to conjunctions/combinations of components that have been seen during training ("conjunction-wise additivity"), and identify novel compositionality failure modes that arise from the data and model structure, even for disentangled inputs. For models in the representation learning (or "rich") regime, we show that networks can generalize on an important non-additive task (associative inference), and give a mechanistic explanation for why. Finally, we validate our theory empirically, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks trained on a set of compositional tasks. In sum, our theory characterizes the principles giving rise to compositional generalization in kernel models and shows how representation learning can overcome their limitations. We further provide a formally grounded, novel generalization class for compositional tasks that highlights fundamental differences in the required learning mechanisms (conjunction-wise additivity).</description>

      <title>Daily Physical Activity Monitoring -- Adaptive Learning from Multi-source Motion Sensor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In healthcare applications, there is a growing need to develop machine learning models that use data from a single source, such as that from a wrist wearable device, to monitor physical activities, assess health risks, and provide immediate health recommendations or interventions. However, the limitation of using single-source data often compromises the model's accuracy, as it fails to capture the full scope of human activities. While a more comprehensive dataset can be gathered in a lab setting using multiple sensors attached to various body parts, this approach is not practical for everyday use due to the impracticality of wearing multiple sensors. To address this challenge, we introduce a transfer learning framework that optimizes machine learning models for everyday applications by leveraging multi-source data collected in a laboratory setting. We introduce a novel metric to leverage the inherent relationship between these multiple data sources, as they are all paired to capture aspects of the same physical activity. Through numerical experiments, our framework outperforms existing methods in classification accuracy and robustness to noise, offering a promising avenue for the enhancement of daily activity monitoring.</description>

      <title>Machine learning in business process management: A systematic literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) provides algorithms to create computer programs based on data without explicitly programming them. In business process management (BPM), ML applications are used to analyse and improve processes efficiently. Three frequent examples of using ML are providing decision support through predictions, discovering accurate process models, and improving resource allocation. This paper organises the body of knowledge on ML in BPM. We extract BPM tasks from different literature streams, summarise them under the phases of a process`s lifecycle, explain how ML helps perform these tasks and identify technical commonalities in ML implementations across tasks. This study is the first exhaustive review of how ML has been used in BPM. We hope that it can open the door for a new era of cumulative research by helping researchers to identify relevant preliminary work and then combine and further develop existing approaches in a focused fashion. Our paper helps managers and consultants to find ML applications that are relevant in the current project phase of a BPM initiative, like redesigning a business process. We also offer - as a synthesis of our review - a research agenda that spreads ten avenues for future research, including applying novel ML concepts like federated learning, addressing less regarded BPM lifecycle phases like process identification, and delivering ML applications with a focus on end-users.</description>

      <title>AdaFisher: Adaptive Second Order Optimization via Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods are currently the mainstream in training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by employing the diagonal matrix preconditioning of the stochastic gradient during the training. Despite their widespread, second-order optimization algorithms exhibit superior convergence properties compared to their first-order counterparts e.g. Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs are still limited due to increased per-iteration computations and suboptimal accuracy compared to the first order methods. We present AdaFisher--an adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a block-diagonal approximation to the Fisher information matrix for adaptive gradient preconditioning. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between enhanced convergence capabilities and computational efficiency in second-order optimization framework for training DNNs. Despite the slow pace of second-order optimizers, we showcase that AdaFisher can be reliably adopted for image classification, language modelling and stand out for its stability and robustness in hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms the SOTA optimizers in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed.

      <title>Intruding with Words: Towards Understanding Graph Injection Attacks at the Text Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel across various applications but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly Graph Injection Attacks (GIAs), which inject malicious nodes into the original graph and pose realistic threats. Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), where nodes are associated with textual features, are crucial due to their prevalence in real-world applications and are commonly used to evaluate these vulnerabilities. However, existing research only focuses on embedding-level GIAs, which inject node embeddings rather than actual textual content, limiting their applicability and simplifying detection. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of GIAs at the text level, presenting three novel attack designs that inject textual content into the graph. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that text interpretability, a factor previously overlooked at the embedding level, plays a crucial role in attack strength. Among the designs we investigate, the Word-frequency-based Text-level GIA (WTGIA) is particularly notable for its balance between performance and interpretability. Despite the success of WTGIA, we discover that defenders can easily enhance their defenses with customized text embedding methods or large language model (LLM)--based predictors. These insights underscore the necessity for further research into the potential and practical significance of text-level GIAs.</description>

      <title>SpinQuant -- LLM quantization with learned rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Recent findings suggest that rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures, and find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant that optimizes (or learns) the rotation matrices with Cayley optimization on a small validation set. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-2 7B/LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by 30.2%/34.1% relative to QuaRot.</description>

      <title>Tensor Attention Training: Provably Efficient Learning of Higher-order Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Attention, a multi-view attention that is able to capture high-order correlations among multiple modalities, can overcome the representational limitations of classical matrix attention. However, the $\Omega(n^3)$ time complexity of tensor attention poses a significant obstacle to its practical implementation in transformers, where $n$ is the input sequence length. In this work, we prove that the backward gradient of tensor attention training can be computed in almost linear $n^{1+o(1)}$ time, the same complexity as its forward computation under a bounded entries assumption. We provide a closed-form solution for the gradient and propose a fast computation method utilizing polynomial approximation methods and tensor algebraic tricks. Furthermore, we prove the necessity and tightness of our assumption through hardness analysis, showing that slightly weakening it renders the gradient problem unsolvable in truly subcubic time. Our theoretical results establish the feasibility of efficient higher-order transformer training and may facilitate practical applications of tensor attention architectures.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Smoothness Properties of Diffusion Models: A Gaussian Mixture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made rapid progress in generating high-quality samples across various domains. However, a theoretical understanding of the Lipschitz continuity and second momentum properties of the diffusion process is still lacking. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a detailed examination of these smoothness properties for the case where the target data distribution is a mixture of Gaussians, which serves as a universal approximator for smooth densities such as image data. We prove that if the target distribution is a $k$-mixture of Gaussians, the density of the entire diffusion process will also be a $k$-mixture of Gaussians. We then derive tight upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant and second momentum that are independent of the number of mixture components $k$. Finally, we apply our analysis to various diffusion solvers, both SDE and ODE based, to establish concrete error guarantees in terms of the total variation distance and KL divergence between the target and learned distributions. Our results provide deeper theoretical insights into the dynamics of the diffusion process under common data distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel graph tokenization framework that generates structure-aware, semantic node identifiers (IDs) in the form of a short sequence of discrete codes, serving as symbolic representations of nodes. We employs vector quantization to compress continuous node embeddings from multiple layers of a graph neural network (GNN), into compact, meaningful codes, under both self-supervised and supervised learning paradigms. The resulting node IDs capture a high-level abstraction of graph data, enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of GNNs. Through extensive experiments on 34 datasets, including node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and attributed graph clustering tasks, we demonstrate that our generated node IDs not only improve computational efficiency but also achieve competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Provably Mitigating Overoptimization in RLHF: Your SFT Loss is Implicitly an Adversarial Regularizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning generative models with human preference via RLHF typically suffers from overoptimization, where an imperfectly learned reward model can misguide the generative model to output undesired responses. We investigate this problem in a principled manner by identifying the source of the misalignment as a form of distributional shift and uncertainty in learning human preferences. To mitigate overoptimization, we first propose a theoretical algorithm that chooses the best policy for an adversarially chosen reward model; one that simultaneously minimizes the maximum likelihood estimation of the loss and a reward penalty term. Here, the reward penalty term is introduced to prevent the policy from choosing actions with spurious high proxy rewards, resulting in provable sample efficiency of the algorithm under a partial coverage style condition. Moving from theory to practice, the proposed algorithm further enjoys an equivalent but surprisingly easy-to-implement reformulation. Using the equivalence between reward models and the corresponding optimal policy, the algorithm features a simple objective that combines: (i) a preference optimization loss that directly aligns the policy with human preference, and (ii) a supervised learning loss that explicitly imitates the policy with a (suitable) baseline distribution. In the context of aligning large language models (LLM), this objective fuses the direct preference optimization (DPO) loss with the supervised fune-tuning (SFT) loss to help mitigate the overoptimization towards undesired responses, for which we name the algorithm Regularized Preference Optimization (RPO). Experiments of aligning LLMs demonstrate the improved performance of RPO compared with DPO baselines. Our work sheds light on the interplay between preference optimization and SFT in tuning LLMs with both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>MambaTS: Improved Selective State Space Models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformers have become the de-facto architecture for long-term sequence forecasting (LTSF), but faces challenges such as quadratic complexity and permutation invariant bias. A recent model, Mamba, based on selective state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a competitive alternative to Transformer, offering comparable performance with higher throughput and linear complexity related to sequence length. In this study, we analyze the limitations of current Mamba in LTSF and propose four targeted improvements, leading to MambaTS. We first introduce variable scan along time to arrange the historical information of all the variables together. We suggest that causal convolution in Mamba is not necessary for LTSF and propose the Temporal Mamba Block (TMB). We further incorporate a dropout mechanism for selective parameters of TMB to mitigate model overfitting. Moreover, we tackle the issue of variable scan order sensitivity by introducing variable permutation training. We further propose variable-aware scan along time to dynamically discover variable relationships during training and decode the optimal variable scan order by solving the shortest path visiting all nodes problem during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on eight public datasets demonstrate that MambaTS achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Categorical Flow Matching on Statistical Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Statistical Flow Matching (SFM), a novel and mathematically rigorous flow-matching framework on the manifold of parameterized probability measures inspired by the results from information geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the discrete generation problem by instantiating SFM on the manifold of categorical distributions whose geometric properties remain unexplored in previous discrete generative models. Utilizing the Fisher information metric, we equip the manifold with a Riemannian structure whose intrinsic geometries are effectively leveraged by following the shortest paths of geodesics. We develop an efficient training and sampling algorithm that overcomes numerical stability issues with a diffeomorphism between manifolds. Our distinctive geometric perspective of statistical manifolds allows us to apply optimal transport during training and interpret SFM as following the steepest direction of the natural gradient. Unlike previous models that rely on variational bounds for likelihood estimation, SFM enjoys the exact likelihood calculation for arbitrary probability measures. We manifest that SFM can learn more complex patterns on the statistical manifold where existing models often fail due to strong prior assumptions. Comprehensive experiments on real-world generative tasks ranging from image, text to biological domains further demonstrate that SFM achieves higher sampling quality and likelihood than other discrete diffusion or flow-based models.</description>

      <title>CacheBlend: Fast Large Language Model Serving with Cached Knowledge Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often incorporate multiple text chunks in their inputs to provide the necessary contexts. To speed up the prefill of the long LLM inputs, one can pre-compute the KV cache of a text and re-use the KV cache when the context is reused as the prefix of another LLM input. However, the reused text chunks are not always the input prefix, and when they are not, their precomputed KV caches cannot be directly used since they ignore the text's cross-attention with the preceding text in the LLM input. Thus, the benefits of reusing KV caches remain largely unrealized.
  This paper tackles just one question: when an LLM input contains multiple text chunks, how to quickly combine their precomputed KV caches in order to achieve the same generation quality as the expensive full prefill (i.e., without reusing KV cache)? We present CacheBlend, a scheme that reuses the pre-computed KV caches, regardless prefix or not, and selectively recomputes the KV values of a small subset of tokens to partially update each reused KV cache. In the meantime,the small extra delay for recomputing some tokens can be pipelined with the retrieval of KV caches within the same job,allowing CacheBlend to store KV caches in slower devices with more storage capacity while retrieving them without increasing the inference delay. By comparing CacheBlend with the state-of-the-art KV cache reusing schemes on three open-source LLMs of various sizes and four popular benchmark datasets of different tasks, we show that CacheBlend reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2.2-3.3X and increases the inference throughput by 2.8-5X, compared with full KV recompute, without compromising generation quality or incurring more storage cost.</description>

      <title>Fast Asymmetric Factorization for Large Scale Multiple Kernel Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel methods are extensively employed for nonlinear data clustering, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on selecting suitable kernels and associated parameters, posing challenges in advance determination. In response, Multiple Kernel Clustering (MKC) has emerged as a solution, allowing the fusion of information from multiple base kernels for clustering. However, both early fusion and late fusion methods for large-scale MKC encounter challenges in memory and time constraints, necessitating simultaneous optimization of both aspects. To address this issue, we propose Efficient Multiple Kernel Concept Factorization (EMKCF), which constructs a new sparse kernel matrix inspired by local regression to achieve memory efficiency. EMKCF learns consensus and individual representations by extending orthogonal concept factorization to handle multiple kernels for time efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of EMKCF on benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method offers a straightforward, scalable, and effective solution for large-scale MKC tasks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use the same policy evaluation and q-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a, 2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect parameterizations of actors and critics in general. Finally, we investigate as an application the mean-variance portfolio selection problem with stock price modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Programmatic Reinforcement Learning Policies with Large Language Model Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmatic reinforcement learning (PRL) has been explored for representing policies through programs as a means to achieve interpretability and generalization. Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to consistently improve the programs. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our LLM-GS framework. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Dominant Shuffle: A Simple Yet Powerful Data Augmentation for Time-series Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have suggested frequency-domain Data augmentation (DA) is effec tive for time series prediction. Existing frequency-domain augmentations disturb the original data with various full-spectrum noises, leading to excess domain gap between augmented and original data. Although impressive performance has been achieved in certain cases, frequency-domain DA has yet to be generalized to time series prediction datasets. In this paper, we found that frequency-domain augmentations can be significantly improved by two modifications that limit the perturbations. First, we found that limiting the perturbation to only dominant frequencies significantly outperforms full-spectrum perturbations. Dominant fre quencies represent the main periodicity and trends of the signal and are more important than other frequencies. Second, we found that simply shuffling the dominant frequency components is superior over sophisticated designed random perturbations. Shuffle rearranges the original components (magnitudes and phases) and limits the external noise. With these two modifications, we proposed dominant shuffle, a simple yet effective data augmentation for time series prediction. Our method is very simple yet powerful and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Extensive experiments with eight datasets and six popular time series models demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance under various settings and significantly outperforms other DA methods.

      <title>Probabilistic Contrastive Learning with Explicit Concentration on the Hypersphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning has predominantly adopted deterministic methods, which are not suited for environments characterized by uncertainty and noise. This paper introduces a new perspective on incorporating uncertainty into contrastive learning by embedding representations within a spherical space, inspired by the von Mises-Fisher distribution (vMF). We introduce an unnormalized form of vMF and leverage the concentration parameter, kappa, as a direct, interpretable measure to quantify uncertainty explicitly. This approach not only provides a probabilistic interpretation of the embedding space but also offers a method to calibrate model confidence against varying levels of data corruption and characteristics. Our empirical results demonstrate that the estimated concentration parameter correlates strongly with the degree of unforeseen data corruption encountered at test time, enables failure analysis, and enhances existing out-of-distribution detection methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Level Additive Modeling for Structured Non-IID Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary challenge in Federated Learning (FL) is to model non-IID distributions across clients, whose fine-grained structure is important to improve knowledge sharing. For example, some knowledge is globally shared across all clients, some is only transferable within a subgroup of clients, and some are client-specific. To capture and exploit this structure, we train models organized in a multi-level structure, called ``Multi-level Additive Models (MAM)'', for better knowledge-sharing across heterogeneous clients and their personalization. In federated MAM (FeMAM), each client is assigned to at most one model per level and its personalized prediction sums up the outputs of models assigned to it across all levels. For the top level, FeMAM trains one global model shared by all clients as FedAvg. For every mid-level, it learns multiple models each assigned to a subgroup of clients, as clustered FL. Every bottom-level model is trained for one client only. In the training objective, each model aims to minimize the residual of the additive predictions by the other models assigned to each client. To approximate the arbitrary structure of non-IID across clients, FeMAM introduces more flexibility and adaptivity to FL by incrementally adding new models to the prediction of each client and reassigning another if necessary, automatically optimizing the knowledge-sharing structure. Extensive experiments show that FeMAM surpasses existing clustered FL and personalized FL methods in various non-IID settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/shutong043/FeMAM.</description>

      <title>Inaccurate Label Distribution Learning with Dependency Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Dependent Noise-based Inaccurate Label Distribution Learning (DN-ILDL) framework to tackle the challenges posed by noise in label distribution learning, which arise from dependencies on instances and labels. We start by modeling the inaccurate label distribution matrix as a combination of the true label distribution and a noise matrix influenced by specific instances and labels. To address this, we develop a linear mapping from instances to their true label distributions, incorporating label correlations, and decompose the noise matrix using feature and label representations, applying group sparsity constraints to accurately capture the noise. Furthermore, we employ graph regularization to align the topological structures of the input and output spaces, ensuring accurate reconstruction of the true label distribution matrix. Utilizing the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for efficient optimization, we validate our method's capability to recover true labels accurately and establish a generalization error bound. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DN-ILDL effectively addresses the ILDL problem and outperforms existing LDL methods.</description>

      <title>Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>Causal-Aware Graph Neural Architecture Search under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph NAS has emerged as a promising approach for autonomously designing GNN architectures by leveraging the correlations between graphs and architectures. Existing methods fail to generalize under distribution shifts that are ubiquitous in real-world graph scenarios, mainly because the graph-architecture correlations they exploit might be spurious and varying across distributions. We propose to handle the distribution shifts in the graph architecture search process by discovering and exploiting the causal relationship between graphs and architectures to search for the optimal architectures that can generalize under distribution shifts. The problem remains unexplored with following challenges: how to discover the causal graph-architecture relationship that has stable predictive abilities across distributions, and how to handle distribution shifts with the discovered causal graph-architecture relationship to search the generalized graph architectures. To address these challenges, we propose Causal-aware Graph Neural Architecture Search (CARNAS), which is able to capture the causal graph-architecture relationship during the architecture search process and discover the generalized graph architecture under distribution shifts. Specifically, we propose Disentangled Causal Subgraph Identification to capture the causal subgraphs that have stable prediction abilities across distributions. Then, we propose Graph Embedding Intervention to intervene on causal subgraphs within the latent space, ensuring that these subgraphs encapsulate essential features for prediction while excluding non-causal elements. Additionally, we propose Invariant Architecture Customization to reinforce the causal invariant nature of the causal subgraphs, which are utilized to tailor generalized graph architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARNAS achieves advanced out-of-distribution generalization ability.</description>

      <title>On Sequential Loss Approximation for Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce for continual learning Autodiff Quadratic Consolidation (AQC), which approximates the previous loss function with a quadratic function, and Neural Consolidation (NC), which approximates the previous loss function with a neural network. Although they are not scalable to large neural networks, they can be used with a fixed pre-trained feature extractor. We empirically study these methods in class-incremental learning, for which regularization-based methods produce unsatisfactory results, unless combined with replay. We find that for small datasets, quadratic approximation of the previous loss function leads to poor results, even with full Hessian computation, and NC could significantly improve the predictive performance, while for large datasets, when used with a fixed pre-trained feature extractor, AQC provides superior predictive performance. We also find that using tanh-output features can improve the predictive performance of AQC. In particular, in class-incremental Split MNIST, when a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with tanh-output features is pre-trained on EMNIST Letters and used as a fixed pre-trained feature extractor, AQC can achieve predictive performance comparable to joint training.</description>

      <title>A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in efficient sequence modeling have led to attention-free layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, all featuring sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length and excellent scaling properties, enabling the construction of a new type of foundation models. In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>GRAG: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses by generative language models, it falls short in graph-based contexts where both textual and topological information are important. Naive RAG approaches inherently neglect the structural intricacies of textual graphs, resulting in a critical gap in the generation process. To address this challenge, we introduce $\textbf{Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG)}$, which significantly enhances both the retrieval and generation processes by emphasizing the importance of subgraph structures. Unlike RAG approaches that focus solely on text-based entity retrieval, GRAG maintains an acute awareness of graph topology, which is crucial for generating contextually and factually coherent responses. Our GRAG approach consists of four main stages: indexing of $k$-hop ego-graphs, graph retrieval, soft pruning to mitigate the impact of irrelevant entities, and generation with pruned textual subgraphs. GRAG's core workflow-retrieving textual subgraphs followed by soft pruning-efficiently identifies relevant subgraph structures while avoiding the computational infeasibility typical of exhaustive subgraph searches, which are NP-hard. Moreover, we propose a novel prompting strategy that achieves lossless conversion from textual subgraphs to hierarchical text descriptions. Extensive experiments on graph multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that in scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning on textual graphs, our GRAG approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art RAG methods while effectively mitigating hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Causal Concept Embedding Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the "hidden" causal structure underlying a deep neural network's (DNN) reasoning. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, causal opacity represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Embedding Models (Causal CEMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. The results of our experiments show that Causal CEMs can: (i) match the generalization performance of causally-opaque models, (ii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness, and (iii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also accuracy of the explanation provided for a specific instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable deep learning aims at developing neural architectures whose decision-making processes could be understood by their users. Among these techniqes, Concept Bottleneck Models enhance the interpretability of neural networks by integrating a layer of human-understandable concepts. These models, however, necessitate training a new model from the beginning, consuming significant resources and failing to utilize already trained large models. To address this issue, we introduce "AnyCBM", a method that transforms any existing trained model into a Concept Bottleneck Model with minimal impact on computational resources. We provide both theoretical and experimental insights showing the effectiveness of AnyCBMs in terms of classification performances and effectivenss of concept-based interventions on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>SE3Set: Harnessing equivariant hypergraph neural networks for molecular representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning. Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17. It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately 20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of complex many-body interactions in larger molecules. This exceptional performance of SE3Set across diverse molecular structures underscores its transformative potential in computational chemistry, offering a route to more accurate and physically nuanced modeling.</description>

      <title>Injective Sliced-Wasserstein embedding for weighted sets and point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the $\textit{Sliced Wasserstein Embedding}$ $\unicode{x2014}$ a novel method to embed multisets and distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into Euclidean space. Our embedding is injective and approximately preserves the Sliced Wasserstein distance. Moreover, when restricted to multisets, it is bi-Lipschitz. We also prove that it is $\textit{impossible}$ to embed distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ into a Euclidean space in a bi-Lipschitz manner, even under the assumption that their support is bounded and finite. We demonstrate empirically that our embedding offers practical advantage in learning tasks over existing methods for handling multisets.</description>

      <title>Multi-State TD Target for Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that updates value estimates for states or state-action pairs using a TD target. This target represents an improved estimate of the true value by incorporating both immediate rewards and the estimated value of subsequent states. Traditionally, TD learning relies on the value of a single subsequent state. We propose an enhanced multi-state TD (MSTD) target that utilizes the estimated values of multiple subsequent states. Building on this new MSTD concept, we develop complete actor-critic algorithms that include management of replay buffers in two modes, and integrate with deep deterministic policy optimization (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Experimental results demonstrate that algorithms employing the MSTD target significantly improve learning performance compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>LoQT: Low Rank Adapters for Quantized Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training of large neural networks requires significant computational resources. Despite advances using low-rank adapters and quantization, pretraining of models such as LLMs on consumer hardware has not been possible without model sharding, offloading during training, or per-layer gradient updates. To address these limitations, we propose LoQT, a method for efficiently training quantized models. LoQT uses gradient-based tensor factorization to initialize low-rank trainable weight matrices that are periodically merged into quantized full-rank weight matrices. Our approach is suitable for both pretraining and fine-tuning of models, which we demonstrate experimentally for language modeling and downstream task adaptation. We find that LoQT enables efficient training of models up to 7B parameters on a consumer-grade 24GB GPU. We also demonstrate the feasibility of training a 13B parameter model using per-layer gradient updates on the same hardware.</description>

      <title>Scalable Numerical Embeddings for Multivariate Time Series: Enhancing Healthcare Data Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) data, when sampled irregularly and asynchronously, often present extensive missing values. Conventional methodologies for MTS analysis tend to rely on temporal embeddings based on timestamps that necessitate subsequent imputations, yet these imputed values frequently deviate substantially from their actual counterparts, thereby compromising prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods typically fail to provide robust initial embeddings for values infrequently observed or even absent within the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalizability. In response to these challenges, we propose SCAlable Numerical Embedding (SCANE), a novel framework that treats each feature value as an independent token, effectively bypassing the need for imputation. SCANE regularizes the traits of distinct feature embeddings and enhances representational learning through a scalable embedding mechanism. Coupling SCANE with the Transformer Encoder architecture, we develop the Scalable nUMerical eMbeddIng Transformer (SUMMIT), which is engineered to deliver precise predictive outputs for MTS characterized by prevalent missing entries. Our experimental validation, conducted across three disparate electronic health record (EHR) datasets marked by elevated missing value frequencies, confirms the superior performance of SUMMIT over contemporary state-of-the-art approaches addressing similar challenges. These results substantiate the efficacy of SCANE and SUMMIT, underscoring their potential applicability across a broad spectrum of MTS data analytical tasks.</description>

      <title>Task Groupings Regularization: Data-Free Meta-Learning with Heterogeneous Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to derive knowledge from a collection of pre-trained models without accessing their original data, enabling the rapid adaptation to new unseen tasks. Current methods often overlook the heterogeneity among pre-trained models, which leads to performance degradation due to task conflicts. In this paper, we empirically and theoretically identify and analyze the model heterogeneity in DFML. We find that model heterogeneity introduces a heterogeneity-homogeneity trade-off, where homogeneous models reduce task conflicts but also increase the overfitting risk. Balancing this trade-off is crucial for learning shared representations across tasks. Based on our findings, we propose Task Groupings Regularization, a novel approach that benefits from model heterogeneity by grouping and aligning conflicting tasks. Specifically, we embed pre-trained models into a task space to compute dissimilarity, and group heterogeneous models together based on this measure. Then, we introduce implicit gradient regularization within each group to mitigate potential conflicts. By encouraging a gradient direction suitable for all tasks, the meta-model captures shared representations that generalize across tasks. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superiority of our approach in multiple benchmarks, effectively tackling the model heterogeneity in challenging multi-domain and multi-architecture scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reality Only Happens Once: Single-Path Generalization Bounds for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the inherent challenges in deploying transformers on time series is that \emph{reality only happens once}; namely, one typically only has access to a single trajectory of the data-generating process comprised of non-i.i.d. observations. We derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees in this setting through bounds on the \textit{generalization} of a transformer network at a future-time $t$, given that it has been trained using $N\le t$ observations from a single perturbed trajectory of a Markov process. Under the assumption that the Markov process satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality, we obtain a generalization bound which effectively converges at the rate of ${O}(1/\sqrt{N})$. Our bound depends explicitly on the activation function ($\operatorname{Swish}$, $\operatorname{GeLU}$, or $\tanh$ are considered), the number of self-attention heads, depth, width, and norm-bounds defining the transformer architecture. Our bound consists of three components: (I) The first quantifies the gap between the stationary distribution of the data-generating Markov process and its distribution at time $t$, this term converges exponentially to $0$. (II) The next term encodes the complexity of the transformer model and, given enough time, eventually converges to $0$ at the rate ${O}(\log(N)^r/\sqrt{N})$ for any $r&gt;0$. (III) The third term guarantees that the bound holds with probability at least $1$-$\delta$, and converges at a rate of ${O}(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$.</description>

      <title>On Bits and Bandits: Quantifying the Regret-Information Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In interactive decision-making tasks, information can be acquired by direct interactions, through receiving indirect feedback, and from external knowledgeable sources. We examine the trade-off between the information an agent accumulates and the regret it suffers. We show that information from external sources, measured in bits, can be traded off for regret, measured in reward. We invoke information-theoretic methods for obtaining regret lower bounds, that also allow us to easily re-derive several known lower bounds. We then generalize a variety of interactive decision-making tasks with external information to a new setting. Using this setting, we introduce the first Bayesian regret lower bounds that depend on the information an agent accumulates. These lower bounds also prove the near-optimality of Thompson sampling for Bayesian problems. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these bounds in improving the performance of a question-answering task with large language models, allowing us to obtain valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Fair Federated Learning under Domain Skew with Local Consistency and Domain Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative training. Under domain skew, the current FL approaches are biased and face two fairness problems. 1) Parameter Update Conflict: data disparity among clients leads to varying parameter importance and inconsistent update directions. These two disparities cause important parameters to potentially be overwhelmed by unimportant ones of dominant updates. It consequently results in significant performance decreases for lower-performing clients. 2) Model Aggregation Bias: existing FL approaches introduce unfair weight allocation and neglect domain diversity. It leads to biased model convergence objective and distinct performance among domains. We discover a pronounced directional update consistency in Federated Learning and propose a novel framework to tackle above issues. First, leveraging the discovered characteristic, we selectively discard unimportant parameter updates to prevent updates from clients with lower performance overwhelmed by unimportant parameters, resulting in fairer generalization performance. Second, we propose a fair aggregation objective to prevent global model bias towards some domains, ensuring that the global model continuously aligns with an unbiased model. The proposed method is generic and can be combined with other existing FL methods to enhance fairness. Comprehensive experiments on Digits and Office-Caltech demonstrate the high fairness and performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Online Multi-LLM Selection with Versatile Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of multi-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become increasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the \textit{C2MAB-V}, a \underline{C}ost-effective \underline{C}ombinatorial \underline{M}ulti-armed \underline{B}andit with \underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM selection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static approaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With multiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to handling user queries, \textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple LLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various collaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed online feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \textit{C2MAB-V} can effectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also balancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear programming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is addressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the local server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides optimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online updates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \textit{C2MAB-V} offers strict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art results for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we show that \textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency with nine LLMs for three application scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a regularized projection matrix approximation framework aimed at recovering cluster information from the affinity matrix. The model is formulated as a projection approximation problem incorporating an entrywise penalty function. We explore three distinct penalty functions addressing bounded, positive, and sparse scenarios, respectively, and derive the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the problem. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis establishing the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our regularized projection matrix approximation approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance.</description>

      <title>A CMDP-within-online framework for Meta-Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-reinforcement learning has widely been used as a learning-to-learn framework to solve unseen tasks with limited experience. However, the aspect of constraint violations has not been adequately addressed in the existing works, making their application restricted in real-world settings. In this paper, we study the problem of meta-safe reinforcement learning (Meta-SRL) through the CMDP-within-online framework to establish the first provable guarantees in this important setting. We obtain task-averaged regret bounds for the reward maximization (optimality gap) and constraint violations using gradient-based meta-learning and show that the task-averaged optimality gap and constraint satisfaction improve with task-similarity in a static environment or task-relatedness in a dynamic environment. Several technical challenges arise when making this framework practical. To this end, we propose a meta-algorithm that performs inexact online learning on the upper bounds of within-task optimality gap and constraint violations estimated by off-policy stationary distribution corrections. Furthermore, we enable the learning rates to be adapted for every task and extend our approach to settings with a competing dynamically changing oracle. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Modeling of Crystallization at Mesoscopic Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization processes at the mesoscopic scale, where faceted, dendritic growth, and multigrain formation can be observed, are of particular interest within materials science and metallurgy. These processes are highly nonlinear, stochastic, and sensitive to small perturbations of system parameters and initial conditions. Methods for the simulation of these processes have been developed using discrete numerical models, but these are computationally expensive. This work aims to scale crystal growth simulation with a machine learning emulator. Specifically, autoregressive latent variable models are well suited for modeling the joint distribution over system parameters and the crystallization trajectories. However, successfully training such models is challenging due to the stochasticity and sensitivity of the system. Existing approaches consequently fail to produce diverse and faithful crystallization trajectories. In this paper, we introduce the Crystal Growth Neural Emulator (CGNE), a probabilistic model for efficient crystal growth emulation at the mesoscopic scale that overcomes these challenges. We validate CGNE results using the morphological properties of the crystals produced by numerical simulation. CGNE delivers a factor of 11 improvement in inference time and performance gains compared with recent state-of-the-art probabilistic models for dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message passing on hypergraphs has been a standard framework for learning higher-order correlations between hypernodes. Recently-proposed hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) can be categorized into spatial and spectral methods based on their design choices. In this work, we analyze the impact of change in hypergraph topology on the suboptimal performance of HGNNs and propose DPHGNN, a novel dual-perspective HGNN that introduces equivariant operator learning to capture lower-order semantics by inducing topology-aware spatial and spectral inductive biases. DPHGNN employs a unified framework to dynamically fuse lower-order explicit feature representations from the underlying graph into the super-imposed hypergraph structure. We benchmark DPHGNN over eight benchmark hypergraph datasets for the semi-supervised hypernode classification task and obtain superior performance compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide a theoretical framework and a synthetic hypergraph isomorphism test to express the power of spatial HGNNs and quantify the expressivity of DPHGNN beyond the Generalized Weisfeiler Leman (1-GWL) test. Finally, DPHGNN was deployed by our partner e-commerce company for the Return-to-Origin (RTO) prediction task, which shows ~7% higher macro F1-Score than the best baseline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent popularity of neural networks comes the need for efficient serving of inference workloads. A neural network inference workload can be represented as a computational graph with nodes as operators transforming multidimensional tensors. The tensors can be transposed and/or tiled in a combinatorially large number of ways, some configurations leading to accelerated inference. We propose TGraph, a neural graph architecture that allows screening for fast configurations of the target computational graph, thus representing an artificial intelligence (AI) tensor compiler in contrast to the traditional heuristics-based compilers. The proposed solution improves mean Kendall's $\tau$ across layout collections of TpuGraphs from 29.8% of the reliable baseline to 67.4% of TGraph. We estimate the potential CO$_2$ emission reduction associated with our work to be equivalent to over 50% of the total household emissions in the areas hosting AI-oriented data centers.</description>

      <title>A unified law of robustness for Bregman divergence losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary deep learning practice, models are often trained to near zero loss i.e. to nearly interpolate the training data. However, the number of parameters in the model is usually far more than the number of data points $n$, the theoretical minimum needed for interpolation: a phenomenon referred to as overparameterization. In an interesting piece of work that contributes to the considerable research that has been devoted to understand overparameterization, Bubeck, and Sellke showed that for a broad class of covariate distributions (specifically those satisfying a natural notion of concentration of measure), overparameterization is necessary for robust interpolation i.e. if the interpolating function is required to be Lipschitz. However, their robustness results were proved only in the setting of regression with square loss. In practice, however many other kinds of losses are used, e.g. cross entropy loss for classification. In this work, we generalize Bubeck and Selke's result to Bregman divergence losses, which form a common generalization of square loss and cross-entropy loss. Our generalization relies on identifying a bias variance-type decomposition that lies at the heart of the proof and Bubeck and Sellke.</description>

      <title>Pick up the PACE: A Parameter-Free Optimizer for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) is the loss of plasticity, where previous learning progress hinders an agent's adaptation to new tasks. While regularization and resetting can help, they require precise hyperparameter selection at the outset and environment-dependent adjustments. Building on the principled theory of online convex optimization, we present a parameter-free optimizer for lifelong RL, called PACE, which requires no tuning or prior knowledge about the distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on Procgen, Atari, and Gym Control environments show that PACE works surprisingly well$\unicode{x2013}$mitigating loss of plasticity and rapidly adapting to challenging distribution shifts$\unicode{x2013}$despite the underlying optimization problem being nonconvex and nonstationary.</description>

      <title>A Provably Effective Method for Pruning Experts in Fine-tuned Sparse Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sparsely gated mixture of experts (MoE) architecture sends different inputs to different subnetworks, i.e., experts, through trainable routers. MoE reduces the training computation significantly for large models, but its deployment can be still memory or computation expensive for some downstream tasks. Model pruning is a popular approach to reduce inference computation, but its application in MoE architecture is largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first provably efficient technique for pruning experts in finetuned MoE models. We theoretically prove that prioritizing the pruning of the experts with a smaller change of the routers l2 norm from the pretrained model guarantees the preservation of test accuracy, while significantly reducing the model size and the computational requirements. Although our theoretical analysis is centered on binary classification tasks on simplified MoE architecture, our expert pruning method is verified on large vision MoE models such as VMoE and E3MoE finetuned on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Grokking in Learning Arithmetic Operations via Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel methodologies aimed at accelerating the grokking phenomenon, which refers to the rapid increment of test accuracy after a long period of overfitting as reported in~\cite{power2022grokking}. Focusing on the grokking phenomenon that arises in learning arithmetic binary operations via the transformer model, we begin with a discussion on data augmentation in the case of commutative binary operations. To further accelerate, we elucidate arithmetic operations through the lens of the Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem, revealing its correspondence to the transformer architecture: embedding, decoder block, and classifier. Observing the shared structure between KA representations associated with binary operations, we suggest various transfer learning mechanisms that expedite grokking. This interpretation is substantiated through a series of rigorous experiments. In addition, our approach is successful in learning two nonstandard arithmetic tasks: composition of operations and a system of equations. Furthermore, we reveal that the model is capable of learning arithmetic operations using a limited number of tokens under embedding transfer, which is supported by a set of experiments as well.</description>

      <title>Comments on Friedman's Method for Class Distribution Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of class distribution estimation (also known as quantification) is to determine the values of the prior class probabilities in a test dataset without class label observations. A variety of methods to achieve this have been proposed in the literature, most of them based on the assumption that the distributions of the training and test data are related through prior probability shift (also known as label shift). Among these methods, Friedman's method has recently been found to perform relatively well both for binary and multi-class quantification. We discuss the properties of Friedman's method and another approach mentioned by Friedman (called DeBias method in the literature) in the context of a general framework for designing linear equation systems for class distribution estimation.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Off-Policy Adversarial Imitation Learning with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) faces challenges with sample inefficiency because of its reliance on sufficient on-policy data to evaluate the performance of the current policy during reward function updates. In this work, we study the convergence properties and sample complexity of off-policy AIL algorithms. We show that, even in the absence of importance sampling correction, reusing samples generated by the $o(\sqrt{K})$ most recent policies, where $K$ is the number of iterations of policy updates and reward updates, does not undermine the convergence guarantees of this class of algorithms. Furthermore, our results indicate that the distribution shift error induced by off-policy updates is dominated by the benefits of having more data available. This result provides theoretical support for the sample efficiency of off-policy AIL algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees for off-policy AIL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts Using Tensor Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-task learning, the conventional approach involves training a model on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, the training signals from different tasks can interfere with one another, potentially leading to \textit{negative transfer}. To mitigate this, we investigate if modular language models can facilitate positive transfer and systematic generalization. Specifically, we propose a novel modular language model (\texttt{TensorPoly}), that balances parameter efficiency with nuanced routing methods. For \textit{modules}, we reparameterize Low-Rank Adaptation (\texttt{LoRA}) by employing an entangled tensor through the use of tensor product operations and name the resulting approach \texttt{TLoRA}. For \textit{routing function}, we tailor two innovative routing functions according to the granularity: \texttt{TensorPoly-I} which directs to each rank within the entangled tensor while \texttt{TensorPoly-II} offers a finer-grained routing approach targeting each order of the entangled tensor. The experimental results from the multi-task T0-benchmark demonstrate that: 1) all modular LMs surpass the corresponding dense approaches, highlighting the potential of modular language models to mitigate negative inference in multi-task learning and deliver superior outcomes. 2) \texttt{TensorPoly-I} achieves higher parameter efficiency in adaptation and outperforms other modular LMs, which shows the potential of our approach in multi-task transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Limits of Deep Learning: Sequence Modeling through the Lens of Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved significant success across various applications but continue to struggle with tasks requiring complex reasoning over sequences, such as function composition and compositional tasks. Despite advancements, models like Structured State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers underperform in deep compositionality tasks due to inherent architectural and training limitations. Maintaining accuracy over multiple reasoning steps remains a primary challenge, as current models often rely on shortcuts rather than genuine multi-step reasoning, leading to performance degradation as task complexity increases. Existing research highlights these shortcomings but lacks comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis for SSMs. Our contributions address this gap by providing a theoretical framework based on complexity theory to explain SSMs' limitations. Moreover, we present extensive empirical evidence demonstrating how these limitations impair function composition and algorithmic task performance. Our experiments reveal significant performance drops as task complexity increases, even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Models frequently resort to shortcuts, leading to errors in multi-step reasoning. This underscores the need for innovative solutions beyond current deep learning paradigms to achieve reliable multi-step reasoning and compositional task-solving in practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Federated Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed systems that allow clients to train models on their data and only share models instead of local data. Generative Models are designed to learn the distribution of a dataset and generate new data samples that are similar to the original data. Many prior works have tried proposing Federated Generative Models. Using Federated Learning and Generative Models together can be susceptible to attacks, and designing the optimal architecture remains challenging.
  This survey covers the growing interest in the intersection of FL and Generative Models by comprehensively reviewing research conducted from 2019 to 2024. We systematically compare nearly 100 papers, focusing on their FL and Generative Model methods and privacy considerations. To make this field more accessible to newcomers, we highlight the state-of-the-art advancements and identify unresolved challenges, offering insights for future research in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>CNN Autoencoder Resizer: A Power-Efficient LoS/NLoS Detector in MIMO-enabled UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the design, performance, and resource efficiency of wireless networks (WNs) necessitates the ability to discern Line of Sight (LoS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLoS) scenarios across diverse applications and environments. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit significant potential in this regard due to their rapid mobility, aerial capabilities, and payload characteristics. Particularly, UAVs can serve as vital non-terrestrial base stations (NTBS) in the event of terrestrial base station (TBS) failures or downtime. In this paper, we propose CNN autoencoder resizer (CAR) as a framework that improves the accuracy of LoS/NLoS detection without demanding extra power consumption. Our proposed method increases the mean accuracy of detecting LoS/NLoS signals from 66% to 86%, while maintaining consistent power consumption levels. In addition, the resolution provided by CAR shows that it can be employed as a preprocessing tool in other methods to enhance the quality of signals.</description>

      <title>Zamba: A Compact 7B SSM Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this technical report, we present Zamba, a novel 7B SSM-transformer hybrid model which achieves competitive performance against leading open-weight models at a comparable scale. Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.</description>

      <title>Amortized Active Causal Induction with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Causal Amortized Active Structure Learning (CAASL), an active intervention design policy that can select interventions that are adaptive, real-time and that does not require access to the likelihood. This policy, an amortized network based on the transformer, is trained with reinforcement learning on a simulator of the design environment, and a reward function that measures how close the true causal graph is to a causal graph posterior inferred from the gathered data. On synthetic data and a single-cell gene expression simulator, we demonstrate empirically that the data acquired through our policy results in a better estimate of the underlying causal graph than alternative strategies. Our design policy successfully achieves amortized intervention design on the distribution of the training environment while also generalizing well to distribution shifts in test-time design environments. Further, our policy also demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization to design environments with dimensionality higher than that during training, and to intervention types that it has not been trained on.</description>

      <title>Exploring Edge Probability Graph Models Beyond Edge Independency: Concepts, Analyses, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) be tractable so that we can compute and control graph statistics, and (ii) generate realistic structures such as high clustering (i.e., high subgraph densities). A popular category of RGMs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, and we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, each edge (in)existence is assumed to be determined independently. However, with edge independency, RGMs theoretically cannot produce high subgraph densities unless they "replicate" input graphs. In this work, we explore realization beyond edge independence that can produce more realistic structures while ensuring high tractability. Specifically, we propose edge-dependent realization schemes called binding and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities in graphs generated with binding. We propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. We empirically validate that binding exhibits high tractability and generates realistic graphs with high clustering, significantly improving upon existing RGMs assuming edge independency.</description>

      <title>Disentangling and Integrating Relational and Sensory Information in Transformer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture processes sequences by implementing a form of neural message-passing that consists of iterative information retrieval (attention), followed by local processing (position-wise MLP). Two types of information are essential under this general computational paradigm: "sensory" information about individual objects, and "relational" information describing the relationships between objects. Standard attention naturally encodes the former, but does not explicitly encode the latter. In this paper, we present an extension of Transformers where multi-head attention is augmented with two distinct types of attention heads, each routing information of a different type. The first type is the standard attention mechanism of Transformers, which captures object-level features, while the second type is a novel attention mechanism we propose to explicitly capture relational information. The two types of attention heads each possess different inductive biases, giving the resulting architecture greater efficiency and versatility. The promise of this approach is demonstrated empirically across a range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Latent Energy-Based Odyssey: Black-Box Optimization via Expanded Exploration in the Energy-Based Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Black-Box Optimization (BBO) aims at optimizing a black-box function using the knowledge from a pre-collected offline dataset of function values and corresponding input designs. However, the high-dimensional and highly-multimodal input design space of black-box function pose inherent challenges for most existing methods that model and operate directly upon input designs. These issues include but are not limited to high sample complexity, which relates to inaccurate approximation of black-box function; and insufficient coverage and exploration of input design modes, which leads to suboptimal proposal of new input designs. In this work, we consider finding a latent space that serves as a compressed yet accurate representation of the design-value joint space, enabling effective latent exploration of high-value input design modes. To this end, we formulate an learnable energy-based latent space, and propose Noise-intensified Telescoping density-Ratio Estimation (NTRE) scheme for variational learning of an accurate latent space model without costly Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The optimization process is then exploration of high-value designs guided by the learned energy-based model in the latent space, formulated as gradient-based sampling from a latent-variable-parameterized inverse model. We show that our particular parameterization encourages expanded exploration around high-value design modes, motivated by inversion thinking of a fundamental result of conditional covariance matrix typically used for variance reduction. We observe that our method, backed by an accurately learned informative latent space and an expanding-exploration model design, yields significant improvements over strong previous methods on both synthetic and real world datasets such as the design-bench suite.</description>

      <title>Pretraining with Random Noise for Fast and Robust Learning without Weight Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through spontaneous neural activity that resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a process has yet to be thoroughly understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the algorithm of machine learning. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise increases the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for teaching errors by feedback alignment. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster than a network without random noise training, even reaching a convergence speed comparable to that of a backpropagation algorithm. Sequential training with both random noise and data brings weights closer to synaptic feedback than training solely with data, enabling more precise credit assignment and faster learning. We also found that each readout probability approaches the chance level and that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization loss during subsequent training. This also enables the network robustly to generalize a novel, out-of-distribution dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a straightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Max Value Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in large or infinite state spaces is notoriously challenging, both theoretically (where worst-case sample and computational complexities must scale with state space cardinality) and experimentally (where function approximation and policy gradient techniques often scale poorly and suffer from instability and high variance). One line of research attempting to address these difficulties makes the natural assumption that we are given a collection of heuristic base or $\textit{constituent}$ policies upon which we would like to improve in a scalable manner. In this work we aim to compete with the $\textit{max-following policy}$, which at each state follows the action of whichever constituent policy has the highest value. The max-following policy is always at least as good as the best constituent policy, and may be considerably better. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that learns to compete with the max-following policy, given only access to the constituent policies (but not their value functions). In contrast to prior work in similar settings, our theoretical results require only the minimal assumption of an ERM oracle for value function approximation for the constituent policies (and not the global optimal policy or the max-following policy itself) on samplable distributions. We illustrate our algorithm's experimental effectiveness and behavior on several robotic simulation testbeds.</description>

      <title>Understanding Linear Probing then Fine-tuning Language Models from NTK Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning (FT) method, linear probing then fine-tuning (LP-FT), consistently outperforms linear probing (LP) and FT alone in terms of accuracy for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This success is largely attributed to the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved through a near-optimal linear head obtained during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, the exploration of complex architectures such as Transformers remains limited. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification models on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components, highlighting the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, stemming from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss, which effectively minimizes feature changes. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, a challenge that can be addressed by temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments with a Transformer-based model on natural language processing tasks across multiple benchmarks confirm our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of LP-FT in fine-tuning language models.

      <title>DMPlug: A Plug-in Method for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs.

      <title>Model Ensembling for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a long history in machine learning of model ensembling, beginning with boosting and bagging and continuing to the present day. Much of this history has focused on combining models for classification and regression, but recently there is interest in more complex settings such as ensembling policies in reinforcement learning. Strong connections have also emerged between ensembling and multicalibration techniques. In this work, we further investigate these themes by considering a setting in which we wish to ensemble models for multidimensional output predictions that are in turn used for downstream optimization. More precisely, we imagine we are given a number of models mapping a state space to multidimensional real-valued predictions. These predictions form the coefficients of a linear objective that we would like to optimize under specified constraints. The fundamental question we address is how to improve and combine such models in a way that outperforms the best of them in the downstream optimization problem. We apply multicalibration techniques that lead to two provably efficient and convergent algorithms. The first of these (the white box approach) requires being given models that map states to output predictions, while the second (the \emph{black box} approach) requires only policies (mappings from states to solutions to the optimization problem). For both, we provide convergence and utility guarantees. We conclude by investigating the performance and behavior of the two algorithms in a controlled experimental setting.</description>

      <title>CHESS: Contextual Harnessing for Efficient SQL Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for transforming natural language questions into SQL queries (text-to-SQL) is a promising yet challenging approach, particularly when applied to real-world databases with complex and extensive schemas. In particular, effectively incorporating data catalogs and database values for SQL generation remains an obstacle, leading to suboptimal solutions. We address this problem by proposing a new pipeline that effectively retrieves relevant data and context, selects an efficient schema, and synthesizes correct and efficient SQL queries. To increase retrieval precision, our pipeline introduces a hierarchical retrieval method leveraging model-generated keywords, locality-sensitive hashing indexing, and vector databases. Additionally, we have developed an adaptive schema pruning technique that adjusts based on the complexity of the problem and the model's context size. Our approach generalizes to both frontier proprietary models like GPT-4 and open-source models such as Llama-3-70B. Through a series of ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of our pipeline and its impact on the end-to-end performance. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the cross-domain challenging BIRD dataset.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in learning governing differential equations from observations of dynamical systems, data-driven methods are often unaware of fundamental physical laws, such as frame invariance. As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.</description>

      <title>Transport of Algebraic Structure to Latent Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning often aims to produce latent embeddings of inputs which lie in a larger, abstract mathematical space. For example, in the field of 3D modeling, subsets of Euclidean space can be embedded as vectors using implicit neural representations. Such subsets also have a natural algebraic structure including operations (e.g., union) and corresponding laws (e.g., associativity). How can we learn to "union" two sets using only their latent embeddings while respecting associativity? We propose a general procedure for parameterizing latent space operations that are provably consistent with the laws on the input space. This is achieved by learning a bijection from the latent space to a carefully designed mirrored algebra which is constructed on Euclidean space in accordance with desired laws. We evaluate these structural transport nets for a range of mirrored algebras against baselines that operate directly on the latent space. Our experiments provide strong evidence that respecting the underlying algebraic structure of the input space is key for learning accurate and self-consistent operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation methods are typically derived based on the Gaussian noise assumption, making them highly sensitive to outliers. Therefore, in the presence of impulsive noise, the performance of these methods may significantly deteriorate. In this paper, we model impulsive noise as Gaussian noise mixed with sparse outliers. By exploiting their statistical differences, we propose a novel DOA estimation method based on sparse signal recovery (SSR). Furthermore, to address the issue of grid mismatch, we utilize an alternating optimization approach that relies on the estimated outlier matrix and the on-grid DOA estimates to obtain the off-grid DOA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robustness against large outliers.</description>

      <title>Physics informed cell representations for variational formulation of multiscale problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of graphical processing units, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are emerging as a promising tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, PINNs are not well suited for solving PDEs with multiscale features, particularly suffering from slow convergence and poor accuracy. To address this limitation of PINNs, this article proposes physics-informed cell representations for resolving multiscale Poisson problems using a model architecture consisting of multilevel multiresolution grids coupled with a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The grid parameters (i.e., the level-dependent feature vectors) and the MLP parameters (i.e., the weights and biases) are determined using gradient-descent based optimization. The variational (weak) form based loss function accelerates computation by allowing the linear interpolation of feature vectors within grid cells. This cell-based MLP model also facilitates the use of a decoupled training scheme for Dirichlet boundary conditions and a parameter-sharing scheme for periodic boundary conditions, delivering superior accuracy compared to conventional PINNs. Furthermore, the numerical examples highlight improved speed and accuracy in solving PDEs with nonlinear or high-frequency boundary conditions and provide insights into hyperparameter selection. In essence, by cell-based MLP model along with the parallel tiny-cuda-nn library, our implementation improves convergence speed and numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>ARC: A Generalist Graph Anomaly Detector with In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD), which aims to identify abnormal nodes that differ from the majority within a graph, has garnered significant attention. However, current GAD methods necessitate training specific to each dataset, resulting in high training costs, substantial data requirements, and limited generalizability when being applied to new datasets and domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ARC, a generalist GAD approach that enables a ``one-for-all'' GAD model to detect anomalies across various graph datasets on-the-fly. Equipped with in-context learning, ARC can directly extract dataset-specific patterns from the target dataset using few-shot normal samples at the inference stage, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning on the target dataset. ARC comprises three components that are well-crafted for capturing universal graph anomaly patterns: 1) smoothness-based feature Alignment module that unifies the features of different datasets into a common and anomaly-sensitive space; 2) ego-neighbor Residual graph encoder that learns abnormality-related node embeddings; and 3) cross-attentive in-Context anomaly scoring module that predicts node abnormality by leveraging few-shot normal samples. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from various domains demonstrate the superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and generalizability of ARC.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fairness in Educational Data Mining in the Context of the Right to be Forgotten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In education data mining (EDM) communities, machine learning has achieved remarkable success in discovering patterns and structures to tackle educational challenges. Notably, fairness and algorithmic bias have gained attention in learning analytics of EDM. With the increasing demand for the right to be forgotten, there is a growing need for machine learning models to forget sensitive data and its impact, particularly within the realm of EDM. The paradigm of selective forgetting, also known as machine unlearning, has been extensively studied to address this need by eliminating the influence of specific data from a pre-trained model without complete retraining. However, existing research assumes that interactive data removal operations are conducted in secure and reliable environments, neglecting potential malicious unlearning requests to undermine the fairness of machine learning systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of selective forgetting attacks designed to compromise the fairness of learning models while maintaining their predictive accuracy, thereby preventing the model owner from detecting the degradation in model performance. Additionally, we propose an innovative optimization framework for selective forgetting attacks, capable of generating malicious unlearning requests across various attack scenarios. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed selective forgetting attacks on fairness through extensive experiments using diverse EDM datasets.</description>

      <title>Dual-State Personalized Knowledge Tracing with Emotional Incorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge tracing has been widely used in online learning systems to guide the students' future learning. However, most existing KT models primarily focus on extracting abundant information from the question sets and explore the relationships between them, but ignore the personalized student behavioral information in the learning process. This will limit the model's ability to accurately capture the personalized knowledge states of students and reasonably predict their performances. To alleviate this limitation, we explicitly models the personalized learning process by incorporating the emotions, a representative personalized behavior in the learning process, into KT framework. Specifically, we present a novel Dual-State Personalized Knowledge Tracing with Emotional Incorporation model to achieve this goal: Firstly, we incorporate emotional information into the modeling process of knowledge state, resulting in the Knowledge State Boosting Module. Secondly, we design an Emotional State Tracing Module to monitor students' personalized emotional states, and propose an emotion prediction method based on personalized emotional states. Finally, we apply the predicted emotions to enhance students' response prediction. Furthermore, to extend the generalization capability of our model across different datasets, we design a transferred version of DEKT, named Transfer Learning-based Self-loop model (T-DEKT). Extensive experiments show our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>TAGA: Text-Attributed Graph Self-Supervised Learning by Synergizing Graph and Text Mutual Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) enhance graph structures with natural language descriptions, enabling detailed representation of data and their relationships across a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. Despite the potential for deeper insights, existing TAG representation learning primarily relies on supervised methods, necessitating extensive labeled data and limiting applicability across diverse contexts. This paper introduces a new self-supervised learning framework, Text-And-Graph Multi-View Alignment (TAGA), which overcomes these constraints by integrating TAGs' structural and semantic dimensions. TAGA constructs two complementary views: Text-of-Graph view, which organizes node texts into structured documents based on graph topology, and the Graph-of-Text view, which converts textual nodes and connections into graph data. By aligning representations from both views, TAGA captures joint textual and structural information. In addition, a novel structure-preserving random walk algorithm is proposed for efficient training on large-sized TAGs. Our framework demonstrates strong performance in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios across eight real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Gradient Compressed Sensing: A Query-Efficient Gradient Estimator for High-Dimensional Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonconvex zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) in a high-dimensional space $\mathbb R^d$ for functions with approximately $s$-sparse gradients. To reduce the dependence on the dimensionality $d$ in the query complexity, high-dimensional ZOO methods seek to leverage gradient sparsity to design gradient estimators. The previous best method needs $O\big(s\log\frac ds\big)$ queries per step to achieve $O\big(\frac1T\big)$ rate of convergence w.r.t. the number T of steps. In this paper, we propose *Gradient Compressed Sensing* (GraCe), a query-efficient and accurate estimator for sparse gradients that uses only $O\big(s\log\log\frac ds\big)$ queries per step and still achieves $O\big(\frac1T\big)$ rate of convergence. To our best knowledge, we are the first to achieve a *double-logarithmic* dependence on $d$ in the query complexity under weaker assumptions. Our proposed GraCe generalizes the Indyk--Price--Woodruff (IPW) algorithm in compressed sensing from linear measurements to nonlinear functions. Furthermore, since the IPW algorithm is purely theoretical due to its impractically large constant, we improve the IPW algorithm via our *dependent random partition* technique together with our corresponding novel analysis and successfully reduce the constant by a factor of nearly 4300. Our GraCe is not only theoretically query-efficient but also achieves strong empirical performance. We benchmark our GraCe against 12 existing ZOO methods with 10000-dimensional functions and demonstrate that GraCe significantly outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^\pi$-Realizability and Concentrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting or designing an appropriate domain adaptation algorithm for a given problem remains challenging. This paper presents a Transformer model that can provably approximate and opt for domain adaptation methods for a given dataset in the in-context learning framework, where a foundation model performs new tasks without updating its parameters at test time. Specifically, we prove that Transformers can approximate instance-based and feature-based unsupervised domain adaptation algorithms and automatically select an algorithm suited for a given dataset. Numerical results indicate that in-context learning demonstrates an adaptive domain adaptation surpassing existing methods.</description>

      <title>Laboratory-Scale AI: Open-Weight Models are Competitive with ChatGPT Even in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative AI has raised questions about the competitiveness of lower-parameter, locally tunable, open-weight models relative to high-parameter, API-guarded, closed-weight models in terms of performance, domain adaptation, cost, and generalization. Centering under-resourced yet risk-intolerant settings in government, research, and healthcare, we see for-profit closed-weight models as incompatible with requirements for transparency, privacy, adaptability, and standards of evidence. Yet the performance penalty in using open-weight models, especially in low-data and low-resource settings, is unclear.
  We assess the feasibility of using smaller, open-weight models to replace GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned regimes, assuming access to only a single, low-cost GPU. We assess value-sensitive issues around bias, privacy, and abstention on three additional tasks relevant to those topics. We find that with relatively low effort, very low absolute monetary cost, and relatively little data for fine-tuning, small open-weight models can achieve competitive performance in domain-adapted tasks without sacrificing generality. We then run experiments considering practical issues in bias, privacy, and hallucination risk, finding that open models offer several benefits over closed models. We intend this work as a case study in understanding the opportunity cost of reproducibility and transparency over for-profit state-of-the-art zero shot performance, finding this cost to be marginal under realistic settings.</description>

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been a popular distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we present a novel conformal prediction method for time-series, which we call Kernel-based Optimally Weighted Conformal Prediction Intervals (KOWCPI). Specifically, KOWCPI adapts the classic Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson (RNW) estimator for quantile regression on dependent data and learns optimal data-adaptive weights. Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of KOWCPI on real time-series against state-of-the-art methods, where KOWCPI achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.</description>

      <title>Safe LoRA: the Silver Lining of Reducing Safety Risks when Fine-tuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fast Feed Forward Networks with Load Balancing and a Master Leaf Node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast feedforward networks (FFFs) are a class of neural networks that exploit the observation that different regions of the input space activate distinct subsets of neurons in wide networks. FFFs partition the input space into separate sections using a differentiable binary tree of neurons and during inference descend the binary tree in order to improve computational efficiency. Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) research, we propose the incorporation of load balancing and Master Leaf techniques into the FFF architecture to improve performance and simplify the training process. We reproduce experiments found in literature and present results on FFF models enhanced using these techniques. The proposed architecture and training recipe achieves up to 16.3% and 3% absolute classification accuracy increase in training and test accuracy, respectively, compared to the original FFF architecture. Additionally, we observe a smaller variance in the results compared to those reported in prior research. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating MoE-inspired techniques into FFFs for developing more accurate and efficient models.</description>

      <title>Non-stochastic Bandits With Evolving Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel online learning framework that unifies and generalizes pre-established models, such as delayed and corrupted feedback, to encompass adversarial environments where action feedback evolves over time. In this setting, the observed loss is arbitrary and may not correlate with the true loss incurred, with each round updating previous observations adversarially. We propose regret minimization algorithms for both the full-information and bandit settings, with regret bounds quantified by the average feedback accuracy relative to the true loss. Our algorithms match the known regret bounds across many special cases, while also introducing previously unknown bounds.</description>

      <title>On Mesa-Optimization in Autoregressively Trained Transformers: Emergence and Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to the world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address downstream tasks. Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a mesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL. Namely, the forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an inner objective function in-context. However, whether the practical non-convex training dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear. Towards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer linear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow, where the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. First, under a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an autoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of gradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem in-context. It then applies the learned $\widehat{W}$ for next-token prediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis. Next, under the same data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained mesa-optimizer. We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of data is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer recovers the distribution. Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the first data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not perform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem. Finally, our simulation results verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>EM Distillation for One-step Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion models can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process. Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, a specific type of generative model, have achieved unprecedented performance in recent years and consistently produce high-quality synthetic samples. A critical prerequisite for their notable success lies in the presence of a substantial number of training samples, which can be impractical in real-world applications due to high collection costs or associated risks. Consequently, various finetuning and regularization approaches have been proposed to transfer knowledge from existing pre-trained models to specific target domains with limited data. This paper introduces the Transfer Guided Diffusion Process (TGDP), a novel approach distinct from conventional finetuning and regularization methods. We prove that the optimal diffusion model for the target domain integrates pre-trained diffusion models on the source domain with additional guidance from a domain classifier. We further extend TGDP to a conditional version for modeling the joint distribution of data and its corresponding labels, together with two additional regularization terms to enhance the model performance. We validate the effectiveness of TGDP on Gaussian mixture simulations and on real electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets.</description>

      <title>Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for applications across multiple domains and various scenarios. Although Transformer models have dramatically shifted the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift focus from the overall architecture of the Transformer to the effectiveness of self-attentions for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Generative Feature Transformation via Graph Contrastive Pre-training and Multi-objective Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature transformation is to derive a new feature set from original features to augment the AI power of data. In many science domains such as material performance screening, while feature transformation can model material formula interactions and compositions and discover performance drivers, supervised labels are collected from expensive and lengthy experiments. This issue motivates an Unsupervised Feature Transformation Learning (UFTL) problem. Prior literature, such as manual transformation, supervised feedback guided search, and PCA, either relies on domain knowledge or expensive supervised feedback, or suffers from large search space, or overlooks non-linear feature-feature interactions. UFTL imposes a major challenge on existing methods: how to design a new unsupervised paradigm that captures complex feature interactions and avoids large search space? To fill this gap, we connect graph, contrastive, and generative learning to develop a measurement-pretrain-finetune paradigm for UFTL. For unsupervised feature set utility measurement, we propose a feature value consistency preservation perspective and develop a mean discounted cumulative gain like unsupervised metric to evaluate feature set utility. For unsupervised feature set representation pretraining, we regard a feature set as a feature-feature interaction graph, and develop an unsupervised graph contrastive learning encoder to embed feature sets into vectors. For generative transformation finetuning, we regard a feature set as a feature cross sequence and feature transformation as sequential generation. We develop a deep generative feature transformation model that coordinates the pretrained feature set encoder and the gradient information extracted from a feature set utility evaluator to optimize a transformed feature generator.</description>

      <title>Scorch: A Library for Sparse Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth in the size of deep learning models strains the capabilities of traditional dense computation paradigms. Leveraging sparse computation has become increasingly popular for training and deploying large-scale models, but existing deep learning frameworks lack extensive support for sparse operations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Scorch, a library that seamlessly integrates efficient sparse tensor computation into the PyTorch ecosystem, with an initial focus on inference workloads on CPUs. Scorch provides a flexible and intuitive interface for sparse tensors, supporting diverse sparse data structures. Scorch introduces a compiler stack that automates key optimizations, including automatic loop ordering, tiling, and format inference. Combined with a runtime that adapts its execution to both dense and sparse data, Scorch delivers substantial speedups over hand-written PyTorch Sparse (torch.sparse) operations without sacrificing usability. More importantly, Scorch enables efficient computation of complex sparse operations that lack hand-optimized PyTorch implementations. This flexibility is crucial for exploring novel sparse architectures. We demonstrate Scorch's ease of use and performance gains on diverse deep learning models across multiple domains. With only minimal code changes, Scorch achieves 1.05-5.78x speedups over PyTorch Sparse on end-to-end tasks. Scorch's seamless integration and performance gains make it a valuable addition to the PyTorch ecosystem. We believe Scorch will enable wider exploration of sparsity as a tool for scaling deep learning and inform the development of other sparse libraries.</description>

      <title>Partial Models for Building Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neuroscience, one of the key behavioral tests for determining whether a subject of study exhibits model-based behavior is to study its adaptiveness to local changes in the environment. In reinforcement learning, however, recent studies have shown that modern model-based agents display poor adaptivity to such changes. The main reason for this is that modern agents are typically designed to improve sample efficiency in single task settings and thus do not take into account the challenges that can arise in other settings. In local adaptation settings, one particularly important challenge is in quickly building and maintaining a sufficiently accurate model after a local change. This is challenging for deep model-based agents as their models and replay buffers are monolithic structures lacking distribution shift handling capabilities. In this study, we show that the conceptually simple idea of partial models can allow deep model-based agents to overcome this challenge and thus allow for building locally adaptive model-based agents. By modeling the different parts of the state space through different models, the agent can not only maintain a model that is accurate across the state space, but it can also quickly adapt it in the presence of a local change in the environment. We demonstrate this by showing that the use of partial models in agents such as deep Dyna-Q, PlaNet and Dreamer can allow for them to effectively adapt to the local changes in their environments.</description>

      <title>Recurrent and Convolutional Neural Networks in Classification of EEG Signal for Guided Imagery and Mental Workload Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Guided Imagery technique is reported to be used by therapists all over the world in order to increase the comfort of patients suffering from a variety of disorders from mental to oncology ones and proved to be successful in numerous of ways. Possible support for the therapists can be estimation of the time at which subject goes into deep relaxation. This paper presents the results of the investigations of a cohort of 26 students exposed to Guided Imagery relaxation technique and mental task workloads conducted with the use of dense array electroencephalographic amplifier. The research reported herein aimed at verification whether it is possible to detect differences between those two states and to classify them using deep learning methods and recurrent neural networks such as EEGNet, Long Short-Term Memory-based classifier, 1D Convolutional Neural Network and hybrid model of 1D Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory. The data processing pipeline was presented from the data acquisition, through the initial data cleaning, preprocessing and postprocessing. The classification was based on two datasets: one of them using 26 so-called cognitive electrodes and the other one using signal collected from 256 channels. So far there have not been such comparisons in the application being discussed. The classification results are presented by the validation metrics such as: accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score and loss for each case. It turned out that it is not necessary to collect signals from all electrodes as classification of the cognitive ones gives the results similar to those obtained for the full signal and extending input to 256 channels does not add much value. In Disscussion there were proposed an optimal classifier as well as some suggestions concerning the prospective development of the project.</description>

      <title>Predicting from a Different Perspective in Re-ranking Model for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rule-induction models have been shown great power in the inductive setting of knowledge graph completion. In this setting, the models are tested on a knowledge graph entirely composed of unseen entities. These models learn relation patterns as rules by utilizing subgraphs. The same input but different rules cause differences in the model's predictions. In this paper, we focus on this behavior of the model. We propose a re-ranking-based model called ReDistLP (Re-ranking with a Distinct Model for Link Prediction). This model enhances the effectiveness of re-ranking by leveraging the difference in the predictions between the initial retriever and the re-ranker. ReDistLP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 2 out of 3 datasets.</description>

      <title>The Uncanny Valley: Exploring Adversarial Robustness from a Flatness Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flatness of the loss surface not only correlates positively with generalization but is also related to adversarial robustness, since perturbations of inputs relate non-linearly to perturbations of weights. In this paper, we empirically analyze the relation between adversarial examples and relative flatness with respect to the parameters of one layer. We observe a peculiar property of adversarial examples: during an iterative first-order white-box attack, the flatness of the loss surface measured around the adversarial example first becomes sharper until the label is flipped, but if we keep the attack running it runs into a flat uncanny valley where the label remains flipped. We find this phenomenon across various model architectures and datasets. Our results also extend to large language models (LLMs), but due to the discrete nature of the input space and comparatively weak attacks, the adversarial examples rarely reach a truly flat region. Most importantly, this phenomenon shows that flatness alone cannot explain adversarial robustness unless we can also guarantee the behavior of the function around the examples. We theoretically connect relative flatness to adversarial robustness by bounding the third derivative of the loss surface, underlining the need for flatness in combination with a low global Lipschitz constant for a robust model.</description>

      <title>Demystifying amortized causal discovery with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised learning approaches for causal discovery from observational data often achieve competitive performance despite seemingly avoiding explicit assumptions that traditional methods make for identifiability. In this work, we investigate CSIvA (Ke et al., 2023), a transformer-based model promising to train on synthetic data and transfer to real data. First, we bridge the gap with existing identifiability theory and show that constraints on the training data distribution implicitly define a prior on the test observations. Consistent with classical approaches, good performance is achieved when we have a good prior on the test data, and the underlying model is identifiable. At the same time, we find new trade-offs. Training on datasets generated from different classes of causal models, unambiguously identifiable in isolation, improves the test generalization. Performance is still guaranteed, as the ambiguous cases resulting from the mixture of identifiable causal models are unlikely to occur (which we formally prove). Overall, our study finds that amortized causal discovery still needs to obey identifiability theory, but it also differs from classical methods in how the assumptions are formulated, trading more reliance on assumptions on the noise type for fewer hypotheses on the mechanisms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an artificial intelligence driven methodology to reduce the bottleneck often encountered in the analog ICs layout phase. We frame the floorplanning problem as a Markov Decision Process and leverage reinforcement learning for automatic placement generation under established topological constraints. Consequently, we introduce Steiner tree-based methods for the global routing step and generate guiding paths to be used to connect every circuit block. Finally, by integrating these solutions into a procedural generation framework, we present a unified pipeline that bridges the divide between circuit design and verification steps. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy in generating complete layouts, eventually reducing runtimes to 1.5% compared to manual efforts.</description>

      <title>Functional Programming Paradigm of Python for Scientific Computation Pipeline Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of modern data processing has led to an increasing tendency towards interdisciplinarity, which frequently involves the importation of different technical approaches. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a unified data control system to facilitate the integration of varying libraries. This integration is of profound significance in accelerating prototype verification, optimising algorithm performance and minimising maintenance costs. This paper presents a novel functional programming (FP) paradigm based on the Python architecture and associated suites in programming practice, designed for the integration of pipelines of different data mapping operations. In particular, the solution is intended for the integration of scientific computation flows, which affords a robust yet flexible solution for the aforementioned challenges.</description>

      <title>Dual-Delayed Asynchronous SGD for Arbitrarily Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the distributed learning problem with data dispersed across multiple workers under the orchestration of a central server. Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been widely explored in such a setting to reduce the synchronization overhead associated with parallelization. However, the performance of asynchronous SGD algorithms often depends on a bounded dissimilarity condition among the workers' local data, a condition that can drastically affect their efficiency when the workers' data are highly heterogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the \textit{dual-delayed asynchronous SGD (DuDe-ASGD)} algorithm designed to neutralize the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. DuDe-ASGD makes full use of stale stochastic gradients from all workers during asynchronous training, leading to two distinct time lags in the model parameters and data samples utilized in the server's iterations. Furthermore, by adopting an incremental aggregation strategy, DuDe-ASGD maintains a per-iteration computational cost that is on par with traditional asynchronous SGD algorithms. Our analysis demonstrates that DuDe-ASGD achieves a near-minimax-optimal convergence rate for smooth nonconvex problems, even when the data across workers are extremely heterogeneous. Numerical experiments indicate that DuDe-ASGD compares favorably with existing asynchronous and synchronous SGD-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Correlation- and Mean-Aware Loss Function and Benchmarking Framework to Improve GAN-based Tabular Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in science rely on data sharing. In medicine, where personal data are often involved, synthetic tabular data generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising avenue. However, existing GANs struggle to capture the complexities of real-world tabular data, which often contain a mix of continuous and categorical variables with potential imbalances and dependencies. We propose a novel correlation- and mean-aware loss function designed to address these challenges as a regularizer for GANs. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmarking framework using ten real-world datasets and eight established tabular GAN baselines. The proposed loss function demonstrates statistically significant improvements over existing methods in capturing the true data distribution, significantly enhancing the quality of synthetic data generated with GANs. The benchmarking framework shows that the enhanced synthetic data quality leads to improved performance in downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, ultimately paving the way for easier data sharing.</description>

      <title>OSLO: One-Shot Label-Only Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce One-Shot Label-Only (OSLO) membership inference attacks (MIAs), which accurately infer a given sample's membership in a target model's training set with high precision using just \emph{a single query}, where the target model only returns the predicted hard label. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art label-only attacks which require $\sim6000$ queries, yet get attack precisions lower than OSLO's. OSLO leverages transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. The core idea is that a member sample exhibits more resistance to adversarial perturbations than a non-member. We compare OSLO against state-of-the-art label-only attacks and demonstrate that, despite requiring only one query, our method significantly outperforms previous attacks in terms of precision and true positive rate (TPR) under the same false positive rates (FPR). For example, compared to previous label-only MIAs, OSLO achieves a TPR that is 7$\times$ to 28$\times$ stronger under a 0.1\% FPR on CIFAR10 for a ResNet model. We evaluated multiple defense mechanisms against OSLO.</description>

      <title>Graph Condensation for Open-World Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning volume of graph data presents significant computational challenges in training graph neural networks (GNNs), critically impeding their efficiency in various applications. To tackle this challenge, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as a promising acceleration solution, focusing on the synthesis of a compact yet representative graph for efficiently training GNNs while retaining performance. Despite the potential to promote scalable use of GNNs, existing GC methods are limited to aligning the condensed graph with merely the observed static graph distribution. This limitation significantly restricts the generalization capacity of condensed graphs, particularly in adapting to dynamic distribution changes. In real-world scenarios, however, graphs are dynamic and constantly evolving, with new nodes and edges being continually integrated. Consequently, due to the limited generalization capacity of condensed graphs, applications that employ GC for efficient GNN training end up with sub-optimal GNNs when confronted with evolving graph structures and distributions in dynamic real-world situations. To overcome this issue, we propose open-world graph condensation (OpenGC), a robust GC framework that integrates structure-aware distribution shift to simulate evolving graph patterns and exploit the temporal environments for invariance condensation. This approach is designed to extract temporal invariant patterns from the original graph, thereby enhancing the generalization capabilities of the condensed graph and, subsequently, the GNNs trained on it. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic evolving graphs demonstrate that OpenGC outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) GC methods in adapting to dynamic changes in open-world graph environments.</description>

      <title>Supervised Batch Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN), a widely-used technique in neural networks, enhances generalization and expedites training by normalizing each mini-batch to the same mean and variance. However, its effectiveness diminishes when confronted with diverse data distributions. To address this challenge, we propose Supervised Batch Normalization (SBN), a pioneering approach. We expand normalization beyond traditional single mean and variance parameters, enabling the identification of data modes prior to training. This ensures effective normalization for samples sharing common features. We define contexts as modes, categorizing data with similar characteristics. These contexts are explicitly defined, such as domains in domain adaptation or modalities in multimodal systems, or implicitly defined through clustering algorithms based on data similarity. We illustrate the superiority of our approach over BN and other commonly employed normalization techniques through various experiments on both single and multi-task datasets. Integrating SBN with Vision Transformer results in a remarkable \textit{15.13}\% accuracy enhancement on CIFAR-100. Additionally, in domain adaptation scenarios, employing AdaMatch demonstrates an impressive \textit{22.25}\% accuracy improvement on MNIST and SVHN compared to BN.</description>

      <title>Any-step Dynamics Model Improves Future Predictions for Online and Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based methods in reinforcement learning offer a promising approach to enhance data efficiency by facilitating policy exploration within a dynamics model. However, accurately predicting sequential steps in the dynamics model remains a challenge due to the bootstrapping prediction, which attributes the next state to the prediction of the current state. This leads to accumulated errors during model roll-out. In this paper, we propose the Any-step Dynamics Model (ADM) to mitigate the compounding error by reducing bootstrapping prediction to direct prediction. ADM allows for the use of variable-length plans as inputs for predicting future states without frequent bootstrapping. We design two algorithms, ADMPO-ON and ADMPO-OFF, which apply ADM in online and offline model-based frameworks, respectively. In the online setting, ADMPO-ON demonstrates improved sample efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. In the offline setting, ADMPO-OFF not only demonstrates superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art offline approaches but also offers better quantification of model uncertainty using only a single ADM.</description>

      <title>FUGNN: Harmonizing Fairness and Utility in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often face a challenging trade-off, where prioritizing fairness may require compromising utility. In this work, we re-examine fairness through the lens of spectral graph theory, aiming to reconcile fairness and utility within the framework of spectral graph learning. We explore the correlation between sensitive features and spectrum in GNNs, using theoretical analysis to delineate the similarity between original sensitive features and those after convolution under different spectrum. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the impact of similarity when the eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalue exhibit directional similarity. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose FUGNN, a novel spectral graph learning approach that harmonizes the conflict between fairness and utility. FUGNN ensures algorithmic fairness and utility by truncating the spectrum and optimizing eigenvector distribution during the encoding process. The fairness-aware eigenvector selection reduces the impact of convolution on sensitive features while concurrently minimizing the sacrifice of utility. FUGNN further optimizes the distribution of eigenvectors through a transformer architecture. By incorporating the optimized spectrum into the graph convolution network, FUGNN effectively learns node representations. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of FUGNN over baseline methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/yushuowiki/FUGNN.</description>

      <title>Glauber Generative Model: Discrete Diffusion Models via Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Glauber Generative Model (GGM), a new class of discrete diffusion models, to obtain new samples from a distribution given samples from a discrete space. GGM deploys a discrete Markov chain called the heat bath dynamics (or the Glauber dynamics) to denoise a sequence of noisy tokens to a sample from a joint distribution of discrete tokens. Our novel conceptual framework provides an exact reduction of the task of learning the denoising Markov chain to solving a class of binary classification tasks. More specifically, the model learns to classify a given token in a noisy sequence as signal or noise. In contrast, prior works on discrete diffusion models either solve regression problems to learn importance ratios, or minimize loss functions given by variational approximations. We apply GGM to language modeling and image generation, where images are discretized using image tokenizers like VQGANs. We show that it outperforms existing discrete diffusion models in language generation, and demonstrates strong performance for image generation without using dataset-specific image tokenizers. We also show that our model is capable of performing well in zero-shot control settings like text and image infilling.</description>

      <title>LabObf: A Label Protection Scheme for Vertical Federated Learning Through Label Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split learning, as one of the most common architectures in vertical federated learning, has gained widespread use in industry due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. In this architecture, the party holding the labels seeks cooperation from other parties to improve model performance due to insufficient feature data. Each of these participants has a self-defined bottom model to learn hidden representations from its own feature data and uploads the embedding vectors to the top model held by the label holder for final predictions. This design allows participants to conduct joint training without directly exchanging data. However, existing research points out that malicious participants may still infer label information from the uploaded embeddings, leading to privacy leakage. In this paper, we first propose an embedding extension attack that manually modifies embeddings to undermine existing defense strategies, which rely on constraining the correlation between the embeddings uploaded by participants and the labels. Subsequently, we propose a new label obfuscation defense strategy, called `LabObf', which randomly maps each original one-hot vector label to multiple numerical soft labels with values intertwined, significantly increasing the difficulty for attackers to infer the labels. We conduct experiments on four different types of datasets, and the results show that LabObf can reduce the attacker's success rate to near random guessing while maintaining an acceptable model accuracy.</description>

      <title>Verifying Properties of Binary Neural Networks Using Sparse Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores methods for verifying the properties of Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), focusing on robustness against adversarial attacks. Despite their lower computational and memory needs, BNNs, like their full-precision counterparts, are also sensitive to input perturbations. Established methods for solving this problem are predominantly based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming techniques, which are characterized by NP complexity and often face scalability issues.
  We introduce an alternative approach using Semidefinite Programming relaxations derived from sparse Polynomial Optimization. Our approach, compatible with continuous input space, not only mitigates numerical issues associated with floating-point calculations but also enhances verification scalability through the strategic use of tighter first-order semidefinite relaxations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in verifying robustness against both $\|.\|_\infty$ and $\|.\|_2$-based adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>HeNCler: Node Clustering in Heterophilous Graphs through Learned Asymmetric Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering nodes in heterophilous graphs presents unique challenges due to the asymmetric relationships often overlooked by traditional methods, which moreover assume that good clustering corresponds to high intra-cluster and low inter-cluster connectivity. To address these issues, we introduce HeNCler - a novel approach for Heterophilous Node Clustering. Our method begins by defining a weighted kernel singular value decomposition to create an asymmetric similarity graph, applicable to both directed and undirected graphs. We further establish that the dual problem of this formulation aligns with asymmetric kernel spectral clustering, interpreting learned graph similarities without relying on homophily. We demonstrate the ability to solve the primal problem directly, circumventing the computational difficulties of the dual approach. Experimental evidence confirms that HeNCler significantly enhances performance in node clustering tasks within heterophilous graph contexts.</description>

      <title>BeamVQ: Aligning Space-Time Forecasting Model via Self-training on Physics-aware Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven deep learning has emerged as the new paradigm to model complex physical space-time systems. These data-driven methods learn patterns by optimizing statistical metrics and tend to overlook the adherence to physical laws, unlike traditional model-driven numerical methods. Thus, they often generate predictions that are not physically realistic. On the other hand, by sampling a large amount of high quality predictions from a data-driven model, some predictions will be more physically plausible than the others and closer to what will happen in the future. Based on this observation, we propose \emph{Beam search by Vector Quantization} (BeamVQ) to enhance the physical alignment of data-driven space-time forecasting models. The key of BeamVQ is to train model on self-generated samples filtered with physics-aware metrics. To be flexibly support different backbone architectures, BeamVQ leverages a code bank to transform any encoder-decoder model to the continuous state space into discrete codes. Afterwards, it iteratively employs beam search to sample high-quality sequences, retains those with the highest physics-aware scores, and trains model on the new dataset. Comprehensive experiments show that BeamVQ not only gave an average statistical skill score boost for more than 32% for ten backbones on five datasets, but also significantly enhances physics-aware metrics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of Continual Learning (CL) task is to continuously learn multiple new tasks sequentially while achieving a balance between the plasticity and stability of new and old knowledge. This paper analyzes that this insufficiency arises from the ineffective handling of outliers, leading to abnormal gradients and unexpected model updates. To address this issue, we enhance the data-aware and parameter-aware robustness of CL, proposing a Robust Continual Learning (RCL) method. From the data perspective, we develop a contrastive loss based on the concepts of uniformity and alignment, forming a feature distribution that is more applicable to outliers. From the parameter perspective, we present a forward strategy for worst-case perturbation and apply robust gradient projection to the parameters. The experimental results on three benchmarks show that the proposed method effectively maintains robustness and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

      <title>Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Multinomial Logit Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new class of MDPs that employs multinomial logit (MNL) function approximation to ensure valid probability distributions over the state space. Despite its benefits, introducing non-linear function approximation raises significant challenges in both computational and statistical efficiency. The best-known method of Hwang and Oh [2023] has achieved an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{-1}dH^2\sqrt{K})$ regret, where $\kappa$ is a problem-dependent quantity, $d$ is the feature space dimension, $H$ is the episode length, and $K$ is the number of episodes. While this result attains the same rate in $K$ as the linear cases, the method requires storing all historical data and suffers from an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ computation cost per episode. Moreover, the quantity $\kappa$ can be exponentially small, leading to a significant gap for the regret compared to the linear cases. In this work, we first address the computational concerns by proposing an online algorithm that achieves the same regret with only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation cost. Then, we design two algorithms that leverage local information to enhance statistical efficiency. They not only maintain an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ computation cost per episode but achieve improved regrets of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa^{-1/2}dH^2\sqrt{K})$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(dH^2\sqrt{K} + \kappa^{-1}d^2H^2)$ respectively. Finally, we establish a lower bound, justifying the optimality of our results in $d$ and $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves almost the same computational and statistical efficiency as linear function approximation while employing non-linear function approximation for reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: Langevin Dynamics is a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) central to sampling and generative modeling and is implemented via time discretization. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), based on the Euler-Maruyama discretization, is the simplest and most studied algorithm. LMC can suffer from slow convergence - requiring a large number of steps of small step-size to obtain good quality samples. This becomes stark in the case of diffusion models where a large number of steps gives the best samples, but the quality degrades rapidly with smaller number of steps. Randomized Midpoint Method has been recently proposed as a better discretization of Langevin dynamics for sampling from strongly log-concave distributions. However, important applications such as diffusion models involve non-log concave densities and contain time varying drift. We propose its variant, the Poisson Midpoint Method, which approximates a small step-size LMC with large step-sizes. We prove that this can obtain a quadratic speed up of LMC under very weak assumptions. We apply our method to diffusion models for image generation and show that it maintains the quality of DDPM with 1000 neural network calls with just 50-80 neural network calls and outperforms ODE based methods with similar compute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new type of gradient flow geometries over non-negative and probability measures motivated via a principled construction that combines the optimal transport and interaction forces modeled by reproducing kernels. Concretely, we propose the interaction-force transport (IFT) gradient flows and its spherical variant via an infimal convolution of the Wasserstein and spherical MMD Riemannian metric tensors. We then develop a particle-based optimization algorithm based on the JKO-splitting scheme of the mass-preserving spherical IFT gradient flows. Finally, we provide both theoretical global exponential convergence guarantees and empirical simulation results for applying the IFT gradient flows to the sampling task of MMD-minimization studied by Arbel et al. [2019]. Furthermore, we prove that the spherical IFT gradient flow enjoys the best of both worlds by providing the global exponential convergence guarantee for both the MMD and KL energy.</description>

      <title>Effective Layer Pruning Through Similarity Metric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been the predominant paradigm in machine learning for solving cognitive tasks. Such models, however, are restricted by a high computational overhead, limiting their applicability and hindering advancements in the field. Extensive research demonstrated that pruning structures from these models is a straightforward approach to reducing network complexity. In this direction, most efforts focus on removing weights or filters. Studies have also been devoted to layer pruning as it promotes superior computational gains. However, layer pruning often hurts the network predictive ability (i.e., accuracy) at high compression rates. This work introduces an effective layer-pruning strategy that meets all underlying properties pursued by pruning methods. Our method estimates the relative importance of a layer using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) metric, employed to measure the similarity between the representations of the unpruned model and a candidate layer for pruning. We confirm the effectiveness of our method on standard architectures and benchmarks, in which it outperforms existing layer-pruning strategies and other state-of-the-art pruning techniques. Particularly, we remove more than 75% of computation while improving predictive ability. At higher compression regimes, our method exhibits negligible accuracy drop, while other methods notably deteriorate model accuracy. Apart from these benefits, our pruned models exhibit robustness to adversarial and out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Output Distribution of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions -- an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.</description>

      <title>Q-value Regularized Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning (RL) have underscored the capabilities of Conditional Sequence Modeling (CSM), a paradigm that learns the action distribution based on history trajectory and target returns for each state. However, these methods often struggle with stitching together optimal trajectories from sub-optimal ones due to the inconsistency between the sampled returns within individual trajectories and the optimal returns across multiple trajectories. Fortunately, Dynamic Programming (DP) methods offer a solution by leveraging a value function to approximate optimal future returns for each state, while these techniques are prone to unstable learning behaviors, particularly in long-horizon and sparse-reward scenarios. Building upon these insights, we propose the Q-value regularized Transformer (QT), which combines the trajectory modeling ability of the Transformer with the predictability of optimal future returns from DP methods. QT learns an action-value function and integrates a term maximizing action-values into the training loss of CSM, which aims to seek optimal actions that align closely with the behavior policy. Empirical evaluations on D4RL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of QT over traditional DP and CSM methods, highlighting the potential of QT to enhance the state-of-the-art in offline RL.</description>

      <title>Finding good policies in average-reward Markov Decision Processes without prior knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the identification of an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDP). In such MDPs, two measures of complexity have appeared in the literature: the diameter, $D$, and the optimal bias span, $H$, which satisfy $H\leq D$. Prior work have studied the complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal policy identification only when a generative model is available. In this case, it is known that there exists an MDP with $D \simeq H$ for which the sample complexity to output an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy is $\Omega(SAD/\varepsilon^2)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. Recently, an algorithm with a sample complexity of order $SAH/\varepsilon^2$ has been proposed, but it requires the knowledge of $H$. We first show that the sample complexity required to estimate $H$ is not bounded by any function of $S,A$ and $H$, ruling out the possibility to easily make the previous algorithm agnostic to $H$. By relying instead on a diameter estimation procedure, we propose the first algorithm for $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC policy identification that does not need any form of prior knowledge on the MDP. Its sample complexity scales in $SAD/\varepsilon^2$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$, which is near-optimal. In the online setting, our first contribution is a lower bound which implies that a sample complexity polynomial in $H$ cannot be achieved in this setting. Then, we propose an online algorithm with a sample complexity in $SAD^2/\varepsilon^2$, as well as a novel approach based on a data-dependent stopping rule that we believe is promising to further reduce this bound.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Bridge AutoEncoders for Unsupervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based representation learning has achieved substantial attention due to its promising capabilities in latent representation and sample generation. Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from a sample and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable z. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes information split problem because the diffusion and the auxiliary encoder would divide the information from the sample into two representations for each model. Particularly, the information modeled by the diffusion becomes over-regularized because of the static prior distribution on xT. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enable z-dependent endpoint xT inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at z, so xT becomes dependent on z in its generation. This results in two consequences: 1) z holds the full information of samples, and 2) xT becomes a learnable distribution, not static any further. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement. Additionally, DBAE generates high-fidelity samples in the unconditional generation.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Layered Intrinsic Dimensionality of Deep Models for Practical Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being a heavily researched topic, Adversarial Training (AT) is rarely, if ever, deployed in practical AI systems for two primary reasons: (i) the gained robustness is frequently accompanied by a drop in generalization and (ii) generating adversarial examples (AEs) is computationally prohibitively expensive. To address these limitations, we propose SMAAT, a new AT algorithm that leverages the manifold conjecture, stating that off-manifold AEs lead to better robustness while on-manifold AEs result in better generalization. Specifically, SMAAT aims at generating a higher proportion of off-manifold AEs by perturbing the intermediate deepnet layer with the lowest intrinsic dimension. This systematically results in better scalability compared to classical AT as it reduces the PGD chains length required for generating the AEs. Additionally, our study provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first explanation for the difference in the generalization and robustness trends between vision and language models, ie., AT results in a drop in generalization in vision models whereas, in encoder-based language models, generalization either improves or remains unchanged. We show that vision transformers and decoder-based models tend to have low intrinsic dimensionality in the earlier layers of the network (more off-manifold AEs), while encoder-based models have low intrinsic dimensionality in the later layers. We demonstrate the efficacy of SMAAT; on several tasks, including robustifying (i) sentiment classifiers, (ii) safety filters in decoder-based models, and (iii) retrievers in RAG setups. SMAAT requires only 25-33% of the GPU time compared to standard AT, while significantly improving robustness across all applications and maintaining comparable generalization.</description>

      <title>Your decision path does matter in pre-training industrial recommenders with multi-source behaviors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online service platforms offering a wide range of services through miniapps have become crucial for users who visit these platforms with clear intentions to find services they are interested in. Aiming at effective content delivery, cross-domain recommendation are introduced to learn high-quality representations by transferring behaviors from data-rich scenarios. However, these methods overlook the impact of the decision path that users take when conduct behaviors, that is, users ultimately exhibit different behaviors based on various intents. To this end, we propose HIER, a novel Hierarchical decIsion path Enhanced Representation learning for cross-domain recommendation. With the help of graph neural networks for high-order topological information of the knowledge graph between multi-source behaviors, we further adaptively learn decision paths through well-designed exemplar-level and information bottleneck based contrastive learning. Extensive experiments in online and offline environments show the superiority of HIER.</description>

      <title>Smoke and Mirrors in Causal Downstream Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where we assume binary effects that are recorded as high-dimensional images in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences. All code and data will be released.</description>

      <title>Injecting Hamiltonian Architectural Bias into Deep Graph Networks for Long-Range Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion within graphs is a critical open issue that heavily influences graph representation learning, especially when considering long-range propagation. This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.</description>

      <title>WeiPer: OOD Detection using Weight Perturbations of Class Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on image data show that pre-trained neural network classifiers can separate in-distribution (ID) from OOD data well, leveraging the class-discriminative ability of the model itself. Methods have been proposed that either use logit information directly or that process the model's penultimate layer activations. With "WeiPer", we introduce perturbations of the class projections in the final fully connected layer which creates a richer representation of the input. We show that this simple trick can improve the OOD detection performance of a variety of methods and additionally propose a distance-based method that leverages the properties of the augmented WeiPer space. We achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection results across multiple benchmarks of the OpenOOD framework, especially pronounced in difficult settings in which OOD samples are positioned close to the training set distribution. We support our findings with theoretical motivations and empirical observations, and run extensive ablations to provide insights into why WeiPer works.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Four Business Cycle Phases Using Machine Learning: A Case Study of US and EuroZone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the business cycle is crucial for building economic stability, guiding business planning, and informing investment decisions. The business cycle refers to the recurring pattern of expansion and contraction in economic activity over time. Economic analysis is inherently complex, incorporating a myriad of factors (such as macroeconomic indicators, political decisions). This complexity makes it challenging to fully account for all variables when determining the current state of the economy and predicting its future trajectory in the upcoming months. The objective of this study is to investigate the capacity of machine learning models in automatically analyzing the state of the economic, with the goal of forecasting business phases (expansion, slowdown, recession and recovery) in the United States and the EuroZone. We compared three different machine learning approaches to classify the phases of the business cycle, and among them, the Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) achieved the best results. Specifically, MLR got the best results by achieving the accuracy of 65.25% (Top1) and 84.74% (Top2) for the EuroZone and 75% (Top1) and 92.14% (Top2) for the United States. These results demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques to predict business cycles accurately, which can aid in making informed decisions in the fields of economics and finance.</description>

      <title>Spectral regularization for adversarially-robust representation learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerability of neural network classifiers to adversarial attacks is a major obstacle to their deployment in safety-critical applications. Regularization of network parameters during training can be used to improve adversarial robustness and generalization performance. Usually, the network is regularized end-to-end, with parameters at all layers affected by regularization. However, in settings where learning representations is key, such as self-supervised learning (SSL), layers after the feature representation will be discarded when performing inference. For these models, regularizing up to the feature space is more suitable. To this end, we propose a new spectral regularizer for representation learning that encourages black-box adversarial robustness in downstream classification tasks. In supervised classification settings, we show empirically that this method is more effective in boosting test accuracy and robustness than previously-proposed methods that regularize all layers of the network. We then show that this method improves the adversarial robustness of classifiers using representations learned with self-supervised training or transferred from another classification task. In all, our work begins to unveil how representational structure affects adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Convex Relaxation for Solving Large-Margin Classifiers in Hyperbolic Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces have increasingly been recognized for their outstanding performance in handling data with inherent hierarchical structures compared to their Euclidean counterparts. However, learning in hyperbolic spaces poses significant challenges. In particular, extending support vector machines to hyperbolic spaces is in general a constrained non-convex optimization problem. Previous and popular attempts to solve hyperbolic SVMs, primarily using projected gradient descent, are generally sensitive to hyperparameters and initializations, often leading to suboptimal solutions. In this work, by first rewriting the problem into a polynomial optimization, we apply semidefinite relaxation and sparse moment-sum-of-squares relaxation to effectively approximate the optima. From extensive empirical experiments, these methods are shown to perform better than the projected gradient descent approach.</description>

      <title>How Do Transformers "Do" Physics? Investigating the Simple Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do transformers model physics? Do transformers model systems with interpretable analytical solutions, or do they create "alien physics" that are difficult for humans to decipher? We take a step in demystifying this larger puzzle by investigating the simple harmonic oscillator (SHO), $\ddot{x}+2\gamma \dot{x}+\omega_0^2x=0$, one of the most fundamental systems in physics. Our goal is to identify the methods transformers use to model the SHO, and to do so we hypothesize and evaluate possible methods by analyzing the encoding of these methods' intermediates. We develop four criteria for the use of a method within the simple testbed of linear regression, where our method is $y = wx$ and our intermediate is $w$: (1) Can the intermediate be predicted from hidden states? (2) Is the intermediate's encoding quality correlated with model performance? (3) Can the majority of variance in hidden states be explained by the intermediate? (4) Can we intervene on hidden states to produce predictable outcomes? Armed with these two correlational (1,2), weak causal (3) and strong causal (4) criteria, we determine that transformers use known numerical methods to model trajectories of the simple harmonic oscillator, specifically the matrix exponential method. Our analysis framework can conveniently extend to high-dimensional linear systems and nonlinear systems, which we hope will help reveal the "world model" hidden in transformers.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Fine-Tuning of Accurate Spatiotemporal Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) that learns maps between Bochner spaces, and a new learning framework to address these issues. This new paradigm leverages wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques to refine the pipeline of commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeling by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed architecture initiates the training with a few epochs for SFNO, concluding with the freezing of most model parameters. Then, the last linear spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The optimization uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time as the loss in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type \emph{a posteriori} error estimator whose evaluation is almost exact thanks to the Parseval identity. This design allows the neural operators to effectively tackle low-frequency errors while the relief of the de-aliasing filter addresses high-frequency errors. Numerical experiments on commonly used benchmarks for the 2D NSE demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers.</description>

      <title>Autoformalizing Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable. Euclidean geometry provides an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization. In this paper, we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry, which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs). One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving gaps in texts that are hard to formalize. To address this issue, we use theorem provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the model. We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem statements. We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of problems from Euclid's Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof assistant. Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems. The data and code are available at https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/LeanEuclid.</description>

      <title>A Retrospective of the Tutorial on Opportunities and Challenges of Online Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have become indispensable in today's world. They support and accelerate the way we make decisions based on the data at hand. This acceleration means that data structures that were valid at one moment could no longer be valid in the future. With these changing data structures, it is necessary to adapt machine learning (ML) systems incrementally to the new data. This is done with the use of online learning or continuous ML technologies. While deep learning technologies have shown exceptional performance on predefined datasets, they have not been widely applied to online, streaming, and continuous learning. In this retrospective of our tutorial titled Opportunities and Challenges of Online Deep Learning held at ECML PKDD 2023, we provide a brief overview of the opportunities but also the potential pitfalls for the application of neural networks in online learning environments using the frameworks River and Deep-River.</description>

      <title>CLAQ: Pushing the Limits of Low-Bit Post-Training Quantization for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attentions recently in reducing memory costs and improving computational efficiency. Early approaches have been widely adopted. However, the existing methods suffer from poor performance in low-bit (such as 2 to 3 bits) scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel and effective Column-Level Adaptive weight Quantization (CLAQ) framework by introducing three different types of adaptive strategies for LLM quantization. Firstly, a K-Means clustering based algorithm is proposed that allows dynamic generation of quantization centroids for each column of a parameter matrix. Secondly, we design an outlier-guided adaptive precision search strategy which can dynamically assign varying bit-widths to different columns. Finally, a dynamic outlier reservation scheme is developed to retain some parameters in their original float point precision, in trade off of boosted model performance. Experiments on various mainstream open source LLMs including LLaMA-1, LLaMA-2 and Yi demonstrate that our methods achieve the state-of-the-art results across different bit settings, especially in extremely low-bit scenarios. Code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Surprise-Adaptive Intrinsic Motivation for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both entropy-minimizing and entropy-maximizing (curiosity) objectives for unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) have been shown to be effective in different environments, depending on the environment's level of natural entropy. However, neither method alone results in an agent that will consistently learn intelligent behavior across environments. In an effort to find a single entropy-based method that will encourage emergent behaviors in any environment, we propose an agent that can adapt its objective online, depending on the entropy conditions by framing the choice as a multi-armed bandit problem. We devise a novel intrinsic feedback signal for the bandit, which captures the agent's ability to control the entropy in its environment. We demonstrate that such agents can learn to control entropy and exhibit emergent behaviors in both high- and low-entropy regimes and can learn skillful behaviors in benchmark tasks. Videos of the trained agents and summarized findings can be found on our project page https://sites.google.com/view/surprise-adaptive-agents</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Vision-Language Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), several attempts have been made to extend them to the visual domain. From having a visual assistant that could guide us through unfamiliar environments to generative models that produce images using only a high-level text description, the vision-language model (VLM) applications will significantly impact our relationship with technology. However, there are many challenges that need to be addressed to improve the reliability of those models. While language is discrete, vision evolves in a much higher dimensional space in which concepts cannot always be easily discretized. To better understand the mechanics behind mapping vision to language, we present this introduction to VLMs which we hope will help anyone who would like to enter the field. First, we introduce what VLMs are, how they work, and how to train them. Then, we present and discuss approaches to evaluate VLMs. Although this work primarily focuses on mapping images to language, we also discuss extending VLMs to videos.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Embedding of Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing the nodes of continuous-time temporal graphs in a low-dimensional latent space has wide-ranging applications, from prediction to visualization. Yet, analyzing continuous-time relational data with timestamped interactions introduces unique challenges due to its sparsity. Merely embedding nodes as trajectories in the latent space overlooks this sparsity, emphasizing the need to quantify uncertainty around the latent positions. In this paper, we propose TGNE (\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{E}mbedding), an innovative method that bridges two distinct strands of literature: the statistical analysis of networks via Latent Space Models (LSM)\cite{Hoff2002} and temporal graph machine learning. TGNE embeds nodes as piece-wise linear trajectories of Gaussian distributions in the latent space, capturing both structural information and uncertainty around the trajectories. We evaluate TGNE's effectiveness in reconstructing the original graph and modelling uncertainty. The results demonstrate that TGNE generates competitive time-varying embedding locations compared to common baselines for reconstructing unobserved edge interactions based on observed edges. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimates align with the time-varying degree distribution in the network, providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of the graph. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide an open-source implementation of TGNE at \url{https://github.com/aida-ugent/tgne}.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Trans-LoRA}$: towards data-free Transferable Parameter Efficient Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank adapters (LoRA) and their variants are popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques that closely match full model fine-tune performance while requiring only a small number of additional parameters. These additional LoRA parameters are specific to the base model being adapted. When the base model needs to be deprecated and replaced with a new one, all the associated LoRA modules need to be re-trained. Such re-training requires access to the data used to train the LoRA for the original base model. This is especially problematic for commercial cloud applications where the LoRA modules and the base models are hosted by service providers who may not be allowed to host proprietary client task data. To address this challenge, we propose $\textit{Trans-LoRA}$ -- a novel method for lossless, nearly data-free transfer of LoRAs across base models. Our approach relies on synthetic data to transfer LoRA modules. Using large language models, we design a synthetic data generator to approximate the data-generating process of the $\textit{observed}$ task data subset. Training on the resulting synthetic dataset transfers LoRA modules to new models. We show the effectiveness of our approach using both LLama and Gemma model families. Our approach achieves lossless (mostly improved) LoRA transfer between models within and across different base model families, and even between different PEFT methods, on a wide variety of tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Simulation of Two-Phase Flows with Neural PDE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.</description>

      <title>FedHPL: Efficient Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Prompt Tuning and Logit Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed clients to collaboratively train models with a central server while keeping raw data locally. In practice, distinct model architectures, varying data distributions, and limited resources across local clients inevitably cause model performance degradation and a slowdown in convergence speed. However, existing FL methods can only solve some of the above heterogeneous challenges and have obvious performance limitations. Notably, a unified framework has not yet been explored to overcome these challenges. Accordingly, we propose FedHPL, a parameter-efficient unified $\textbf{Fed}$erated learning framework for $\textbf{H}$eterogeneous settings based on $\textbf{P}$rompt tuning and $\textbf{L}$ogit distillation. Specifically, we employ a local prompt tuning scheme that leverages a few learnable visual prompts to efficiently fine-tune the frozen pre-trained foundation model for downstream tasks, thereby accelerating training and improving model performance under limited local resources and data heterogeneity. Moreover, we design a global logit distillation scheme to handle the model heterogeneity and guide the local training. In detail, we leverage logits to implicitly capture local knowledge and design a weighted knowledge aggregation mechanism to generate global client-specific logits. We provide a theoretical guarantee on the generalization error bound for FedHPL. The experiments on various benchmark datasets under diverse settings of models and data demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art FL approaches, with less computation overhead and training rounds.</description>

      <title>DPN: Decoupling Partition and Navigation for Neural Solvers of Min-max Vehicle Routing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The min-max vehicle routing problem (min-max VRP) traverses all given customers by assigning several routes and aims to minimize the length of the longest route. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based sequential planning methods have exhibited advantages in solving efficiency and optimality. However, these methods fail to exploit the problem-specific properties in learning representations, resulting in less effective features for decoding optimal routes. This paper considers the sequential planning process of min-max VRPs as two coupled optimization tasks: customer partition for different routes and customer navigation in each route (i.e., partition and navigation). To effectively process min-max VRP instances, we present a novel attention-based Partition-and-Navigation encoder (P&amp;N Encoder) that learns distinct embeddings for partition and navigation. Furthermore, we utilize an inherent symmetry in decoding routes and develop an effective agent-permutation-symmetric (APS) loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Decoupling-Partition-Navigation (DPN) method significantly surpasses existing learning-based methods in both single-depot and multi-depot min-max VRPs.

      <description>arXiv:2405.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning scientific and probabilistic machine learning models -- for example, partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian neural networks -- often relies on evaluating functions of matrices whose size grows with the data set or the number of parameters. While the state-of-the-art for evaluating these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to differentiate these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently. To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks. All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation. Find the code at https://github.com/pnkraemer/experiments-lanczos-adjoints and install the library with pip install matfree.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Complex-Weighted Autoencoders for Unsupervised Object Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art synchrony-based models encode object bindings with complex-valued activations and compute with real-valued weights in feedforward architectures. We argue for the computational advantages of a recurrent architecture with complex-valued weights. We propose a fully convolutional autoencoder, SynCx, that performs iterative constraint satisfaction: at each iteration, a hidden layer bottleneck encodes statistically regular configurations of features in particular phase relationships; over iterations, local constraints propagate and the model converges to a globally consistent configuration of phase assignments. Binding is achieved simply by the matrix-vector product operation between complex-valued weights and activations, without the need for additional mechanisms that have been incorporated into current synchrony-based models. SynCx outperforms or is strongly competitive with current models for unsupervised object discovery. SynCx also avoids certain systematic grouping errors of current models, such as the inability to separate similarly colored objects without additional supervision.</description>

      <title>Opinion-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human guidance is often desired in reinforcement learning to improve the performance of the learning agent. However, human insights are often mere opinions and educated guesses rather than well-formulated arguments. While opinions are subject to uncertainty, e.g., due to partial informedness or ignorance about a problem, they also emerge earlier than hard evidence could be produced. Thus, guiding reinforcement learning agents through opinions offers the potential for more performant learning processes, but comes with the challenge of modeling and managing opinions in a formal way. In this article, we present a method to guide reinforcement learning agents through opinions. To this end, we provide an end-to-end method to model and manage advisors' opinions. To assess the utility of the approach, we evaluate it with synthetic and human advisors, at different levels of uncertainty, and under multiple advise strategies. Our results indicate that opinions, even if uncertain, improve the performance of reinforcement learning agents, resulting in higher rewards, more efficient exploration, and a better reinforced policy. Although we demonstrate our approach in a simplified topological running example, our approach is applicable to complex problems with higher dimensions as well.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ensembles Improve Training Data Attribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to quantify the influence of individual training data points on the model predictions, with broad applications in data-centric AI, such as mislabel detection, data selection, and copyright compensation. However, existing methods in this field, which can be categorized as retraining-based and gradient-based, have struggled with the trade-off between computational efficiency and attribution efficacy. Retraining-based methods can accurately attribute complex non-convex models but are computationally prohibitive, while gradient-based methods are efficient but often fail for non-convex models. Recent research has shown that augmenting gradient-based methods with ensembles of multiple independently trained models can achieve significantly better attribution efficacy. However, this approach remains impractical for very large-scale applications.
  In this work, we discover that expensive, fully independent training is unnecessary for ensembling the gradient-based methods, and we propose two efficient ensemble strategies, DROPOUT ENSEMBLE and LORA ENSEMBLE, alternative to naive independent ensemble. These strategies significantly reduce training time (up to 80%), serving time (up to 60%), and space cost (up to 80%) while maintaining similar attribution efficacy to the naive independent ensemble. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategies are effective across multiple TDA methods on diverse datasets and models, including generative settings, significantly advancing the Pareto frontier of TDA methods with better computational efficiency and attribution efficacy.</description>

      <title>Survey of Graph Neural Network for Internet of Things and NextG Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices coupled with 6G pushing towards higher data rates and connected devices has sparked a surge in data. Consequently, harnessing the full potential of data-driven machine learning has become one of the important thrusts. In addition to the advancement in wireless technology, it is important to efficiently use the resources available and meet the users' requirements. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for effectively modeling and extracting insights which inherently exhibit complex network structures due to its high performance and accuracy, scalability, adaptability, and resource efficiency. There is a lack of a comprehensive survey that focuses on the applications and advances GNN has made in the context of IoT and Next Generation (NextG) networks. To bridge that gap, this survey starts by providing a detailed description of GNN's terminologies, architecture, and the different types of GNNs. Then we provide a comprehensive survey of the advancements in applying GNNs for IoT from the perspective of data fusion and intrusion detection. Thereafter, we survey the impact GNN has made in improving spectrum awareness. Next, we provide a detailed account of how GNN has been leveraged for networking and tactical systems. Through this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers to learn more about GNN in the context of wireless networks, and understand its state-of-the-art use cases while contrasting to other machine learning approaches. Finally, we also discussed the challenges and wide range of future research directions to further motivate the use of GNN for IoT and NextG Networks.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Graph Rewiring via Virtual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph-based machine learning. Despite their effectiveness, MPNNs face challenges such as under-reaching and over-squashing, where limited receptive fields and structural bottlenecks hinder information flow in the graph. While graph transformers hold promise in addressing these issues, their scalability is limited due to quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes, rendering them impractical for larger graphs. Here, we propose \emph{implicitly rewired message-passing neural networks} (IPR-MPNNs), a novel approach that integrates \emph{implicit} probabilistic graph rewiring into MPNNs. By introducing a small number of virtual nodes, i.e., adding additional nodes to a given graph and connecting them to existing nodes, in a differentiable, end-to-end manner, IPR-MPNNs enable long-distance message propagation, circumventing quadratic complexity. Theoretically, we demonstrate that IPR-MPNNs surpass the expressiveness of traditional MPNNs. Empirically, we validate our approach by showcasing its ability to mitigate under-reaching and over-squashing effects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple graph datasets. Notably, IPR-MPNNs outperform graph transformers while maintaining significantly faster computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Offline Data in Linear Latent Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making domains such as recommender systems, healthcare and education often have unobserved heterogeneity in the population that can be modeled using latent bandits $-$ a framework where an unobserved latent state determines the model for a trajectory. While the latent bandit framework is compelling, the extent of its generality is unclear. We first address this by establishing a de Finetti theorem for decision processes, and show that $\textit{every}$ exchangeable and coherent stateless decision process is a latent bandit. The latent bandit framework lends itself particularly well to online learning with offline datasets, a problem of growing interest in sequential decision-making. One can leverage offline latent bandit data to learn a complex model for each latent state, so that an agent can simply learn the latent state online to act optimally. We focus on a linear model for a latent bandit with $d_A$-dimensional actions, where the latent states lie in an unknown $d_K$-dimensional subspace for $d_K \ll d_A$. We present SOLD, a novel principled method to learn this subspace from short offline trajectories with guarantees. We then provide two methods to leverage this subspace online: LOCAL-UCB and ProBALL-UCB. We demonstrate that LOCAL-UCB enjoys $\tilde O(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, where the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger. ProBALL-UCB enjoys a slightly weaker guarantee, but is more practical and computationally efficient. Finally, we establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Real NVP for Satellite Power System Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique challenges posed by the space environment, characterized by extreme conditions and limited accessibility, raise the need for robust and reliable techniques to identify and prevent satellite faults. Fault detection methods in the space sector are required to ensure mission success and to protect valuable assets. In this context, this paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based fault detection methodology and evaluates its performance on ADAPT (Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed), an Electrical Power System (EPS) dataset, crafted in laboratory by NASA.
  Our study focuses on the application of a physics-informed (PI) real-valued non-volume preserving (Real NVP) model for fault detection in space systems. The efficacy of this method is systematically compared against other AI approaches such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Autoencoder-based techniques.
  Results show that our physics-informed approach outperforms existing methods of fault detection, demonstrating its suitability for addressing the unique challenges of satellite EPS sub-system faults. Furthermore, we unveil the competitive advantage of physics-informed loss in AI models to address specific space needs, namely robustness, reliability, and power constraints, crucial for space exploration and satellite missions.</description>

      <title>Prompt Optimization with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performances in various tasks. However, the performance of LLMs heavily depends on the input prompt, which has given rise to a number of recent works on prompt optimization. However, previous works often require the availability of a numeric score to assess the quality of every prompt. Unfortunately, when a human user interacts with a black-box LLM, attaining such a score is often infeasible and unreliable. Instead, it is usually significantly easier and more reliable to obtain preference feedback from a human user, i.e., showing the user the responses generated from a pair of prompts and asking the user which one is preferred. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of prompt optimization with human feedback (POHF), in which we aim to optimize the prompt for a black-box LLM using only human preference feedback. Drawing inspiration from dueling bandits, we design a theoretically principled strategy to select a pair of prompts to query for preference feedback in every iteration, and hence introduce our algorithm named automated POHF (APOHF). We apply our APOHF algorithm to various tasks, including optimizing user instructions, prompt optimization for text-to-image generative models, and response optimization with human feedback (i.e., further refining the response using a variant of our APOHF). The results demonstrate that our APOHF can efficiently find a good prompt using a small number of preference feedback instances. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xqlin98/APOHF}.</description>

      <title>Assessing the significance of longitudinal data in Alzheimer's Disease forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a transformer encoder model to characterize the significance of longitudinal patient data for forecasting the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Our model, Longitudinal Forecasting Model for Alzheimer's Disease (LongForMAD), harnesses the comprehensive temporal information embedded in sequences of patient visits that incorporate multimodal data, providing a deeper understanding of disease progression than can be drawn from single-visit data alone. We present an empirical analysis across two patient groups-Cognitively Normal (CN) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)-over a span of five follow-up years. Our findings reveal that models incorporating more extended patient histories can outperform those relying solely on present information, suggesting a deeper historical context is critical in enhancing predictive accuracy for future AD progression. Our results support the incorporation of longitudinal data in clinical settings to enhance the early detection and monitoring of AD. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/batuhankmkaraman/LongForMAD}.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Transformers in Solving POMDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential decision-making algorithms such as reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world scenarios inevitably face environments with partial observability. This paper scrutinizes the effectiveness of a popular architecture, namely Transformers, in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) and reveals its theoretical limitations. We establish that regular languages, which Transformers struggle to model, are reducible to POMDPs. This poses a significant challenge for Transformers in learning POMDP-specific inductive biases, due to their lack of inherent recurrence found in other models like RNNs. This paper casts doubt on the prevalent belief in Transformers as sequence models for RL and proposes to introduce a point-wise recurrent structure. The Deep Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) emerges as a well-suited alternative for Partially Observable RL, with empirical results highlighting the sub-optimal performance of the Transformer and considerable strength of LRU.</description>

      <title>EM-GANSim: Real-time and Accurate EM Simulation Using Conditional GANs for 3D Indoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps. Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Safety Landscape: Measuring Risks in Finetuning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety alignment is the key to guiding the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) that are in line with human preferences and restrict harmful behaviors at inference time, but recent studies show that it can be easily compromised by finetuning with only a few adversarially designed training examples. We aim to measure the risks in finetuning LLMs through navigating the LLM safety landscape. We discover a new phenomenon observed universally in the model parameter space of popular open-source LLMs, termed as "safety basin": randomly perturbing model weights maintains the safety level of the original aligned model in its local neighborhood. Our discovery inspires us to propose the new VISAGE safety metric that measures the safety in LLM finetuning by probing its safety landscape. Visualizing the safety landscape of the aligned model enables us to understand how finetuning compromises safety by dragging the model away from the safety basin. LLM safety landscape also highlights the system prompt's critical role in protecting a model, and that such protection transfers to its perturbed variants within the safety basin. These observations from our safety landscape research provide new insights for future work on LLM safety community.</description>

      <title>How Does Perfect Fitting Affect Representation Learning? On the Training Dynamics of Representations in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we elucidate how representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) evolve during training. We focus on overparameterized learning settings where the training continues much after the trained DNN starts to perfectly fit its training data. We examine the evolution of learned representations along the entire training process, including its perfect fitting regime, and with respect to the epoch-wise double descent phenomenon. We explore the representational similarity of DNN layers, each layer with respect to its own representations throughout the training process. For this, we use two similarity metrics: (1) The centered kernel alignment (CKA) similarity; (2) Similarity of decision regions of linear classifier probes that we train for the DNN layers. Our extensive experiments discover training dynamics patterns that can emerge in layers depending on the relative layer-depth, DNN width, and architecture. We show that representations at the deeper layers evolve much more in the training when an epoch-wise double descent occurs. For Vision Transformer, we show that the perfect fitting threshold creates a transition in the evolution of representations across all the encoder blocks.</description>

      <title>RTL-Repo: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Large-Scale RTL Design Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting with Register Transfer Level (RTL) design tasks. Nevertheless, there remains to be a significant gap in benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexity of real-world RTL projects. To address this, this paper presents RTL-Repo, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on large-scale RTL design projects. RTL-Repo includes a comprehensive dataset of more than 4000 Verilog code samples extracted from public GitHub repositories, with each sample providing the full context of the corresponding repository. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on the RTL-Repo benchmark, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Starcoder2, alongside Verilog-specific models like VeriGen and RTLCoder, and compare their performance in generating Verilog code for complex projects. The RTL-Repo benchmark provides a valuable resource for the hardware design community to assess and compare LLMs' performance in real-world RTL design scenarios and train LLMs specifically for Verilog code generation in complex, multi-file RTL projects. RTL-Repo is open-source and publicly available on Github.</description>

      <title>ReMoDetect: Reward Models Recognize Aligned LLM's Generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable capabilities and easy accessibility of large language models (LLMs) have significantly increased societal risks (e.g., fake news generation), necessitating the development of LLM-generated text (LGT) detection methods for safe usage. However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to the vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM individually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics shared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make the reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six text domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates state-of-the-art results.

      <title>Dataset-learning duality and emergent criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In artificial neural networks, the activation dynamics of non-trainable variables is strongly coupled to the learning dynamics of trainable variables. During the activation pass, the boundary neurons (e.g., input neurons) are mapped to the bulk neurons (e.g., hidden neurons), and during the learning pass, both bulk and boundary neurons are mapped to changes in trainable variables (e.g., weights and biases). For example, in feed-forward neural networks, forward propagation is the activation pass and backward propagation is the learning pass. We show that a composition of the two maps establishes a duality map between a subspace of non-trainable boundary variables (e.g., dataset) and a tangent subspace of trainable variables (i.e., learning). In general, the dataset-learning duality is a complex non-linear map between high-dimensional spaces, but in a learning equilibrium, the problem can be linearized and reduced to many weakly coupled one-dimensional problems. We use the duality to study the emergence of criticality, or the power-law distributions of fluctuations of the trainable variables. In particular, we show that criticality can emerge in the learning system even from the dataset in a non-critical state, and that the power-law distribution can be modified by changing either the activation function or the loss function.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Do Arithmetic with the Right Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in large part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each digit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an embedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the number. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show that this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and recurrent layers to improve performance even further.
  With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of transformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more complex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20 digit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems. Finally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other multi-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.</description>

      <title>RB-Modulation: Training-Free Personalization of Diffusion Models using Stochastic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Reference-Based Modulation (RB-Modulation), a new plug-and-play solution for training-free personalization of diffusion models. Existing training-free approaches exhibit difficulties in (a) style extraction from reference images in the absence of additional style or content text descriptions, (b) unwanted content leakage from reference style images, and (c) effective composition of style and content. RB-Modulation is built on a novel stochastic optimal controller where a style descriptor encodes the desired attributes through a terminal cost. The resulting drift not only overcomes the difficulties above, but also ensures high fidelity to the reference style and adheres to the given text prompt. We also introduce a cross-attention-based feature aggregation scheme that allows RB-Modulation to decouple content and style from the reference image. With theoretical justification and empirical evidence, our framework demonstrates precise extraction and control of content and style in a training-free manner. Further, our method allows a seamless composition of content and style, which marks a departure from the dependency on external adapters or ControlNets.</description>

Abstract: Training diffusion models is always a computation-intensive task. In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</description>

      <title>Spectral Greedy Coresets for Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ubiquity of large-scale graphs in node-classification tasks significantly hinders the real-world applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Node sampling, graph coarsening, and dataset condensation are effective strategies for enhancing data efficiency. However, owing to the interdependence of graph nodes, coreset selection, which selects subsets of the data examples, has not been successfully applied to speed up GNN training on large graphs, warranting special treatment. This paper studies graph coresets for GNNs and avoids the interdependence issue by selecting ego-graphs (i.e., neighborhood subgraphs around a node) based on their spectral embeddings. We decompose the coreset selection problem for GNNs into two phases: a coarse selection of widely spread ego graphs and a refined selection to diversify their topologies. We design a greedy algorithm that approximately optimizes both objectives. Our spectral greedy graph coreset (SGGC) scales to graphs with millions of nodes, obviates the need for model pre-training, and applies to low-homophily graphs. Extensive experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that SGGC outperforms other coreset methods by a wide margin, generalizes well across GNN architectures, and is much faster than graph condensation.</description>

      <title>A Recipe for Unbounded Data Augmentation in Visual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $Q$-learning algorithms are appealing for real-world applications due to their data-efficiency, but they are very prone to overfitting and training instabilities when trained from visual observations. Prior work, namely SVEA, finds that selective application of data augmentation can improve the visual generalization of RL agents without destabilizing training. We revisit its recipe for data augmentation, and find an assumption that limits its effectiveness to augmentations of a photometric nature. Addressing these limitations, we propose a generalized recipe, SADA, that works with wider varieties of augmentations. We benchmark its effectiveness on DMC-GB2 -- our proposed extension of the popular DMControl Generalization Benchmark -- as well as tasks from Meta-World and the Distracting Control Suite, and find that our method, SADA, greatly improves training stability and generalization of RL agents across a diverse set of augmentations. Visualizations, code, and benchmark: see https://aalmuzairee.github.io/SADA/</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest Representation: A Case Study with Modular Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a neural network can learn multiple distinct algorithms to solve a task, how does it "choose" between them during training? To approach this question, we take inspiration from ecology: when multiple species coexist, they eventually reach an equilibrium where some survive while others die out. Analogously, we suggest that a neural network at initialization contains many solutions (representations and algorithms), which compete with each other under pressure from resource constraints, with the "fittest" ultimately prevailing. To investigate this Survival of the Fittest hypothesis, we conduct a case study on neural networks performing modular addition, and find that these networks' multiple circular representations at different Fourier frequencies undergo such competitive dynamics, with only a few circles surviving at the end. We find that the frequencies with high initial signals and gradients, the "fittest," are more likely to survive. By increasing the embedding dimension, we also observe more surviving frequencies. Inspired by the Lotka-Volterra equations describing the dynamics between species, we find that the dynamics of the circles can be nicely characterized by a set of linear differential equations. Our results with modular addition show that it is possible to decompose complicated representations into simpler components, along with their basic interactions, to offer insight on the training dynamics of representations.</description>

      <title>From Neurons to Neutrons: A Case Study in Interpretability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) promises a path toward fully understanding how neural networks make their predictions. Prior work demonstrates that even when trained to perform simple arithmetic, models can implement a variety of algorithms (sometimes concurrently) depending on initialization and hyperparameters. Does this mean neuron-level interpretability techniques have limited applicability? We argue that high-dimensional neural networks can learn low-dimensional representations of their training data that are useful beyond simply making good predictions. Such representations can be understood through the mechanistic interpretability lens and provide insights that are surprisingly faithful to human-derived domain knowledge. This indicates that such approaches to interpretability can be useful for deriving a new understanding of a problem from models trained to solve it. As a case study, we extract nuclear physics concepts by studying models trained to reproduce nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Generative Tabular Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective tabular data watermarking mechanism with statistical guarantees. We show theoretically that the proposed watermark can be effectively detected, while faithfully preserving the data fidelity, and also demonstrates appealing robustness against additive noise attack. The general idea is to achieve the watermarking through a strategic embedding based on simple data binning. Specifically, it divides the feature's value range into finely segmented intervals and embeds watermarks into selected ``green list" intervals. To detect the watermarks, we develop a principled statistical hypothesis-testing framework with minimal assumptions: it remains valid as long as the underlying data distribution has a continuous density function. The watermarking efficacy is demonstrated through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, highlighting its utility in enhancing the security of synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Splitting of Reusable Temporal Monitors for Rare Traffic Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.</description>

      <title>Feature Aggregation with Latent Generative Replay for Federated Continual Learning of Socially Appropriate Robot Behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For widespread real-world applications, it is beneficial for robots to explore Federated Learning (FL) settings where several robots, deployed in parallel, can learn independently while also sharing their learning with each other. This work explores a simulated living room environment where robots need to learn the social appropriateness of their actions. We propose Federated Root (FedRoot), a novel weight aggregation strategy which disentangles feature learning across clients from individual task-based learning. Adapting popular FL strategies to use FedRoot instead, we present a novel FL benchmark for learning the social appropriateness of different robot actions in diverse social configurations. FedRoot-based methods offer competitive performance compared to others while offering sizeable (up to 86% for CPU usage and up to 72% for GPU usage) reduction in resource consumption. Furthermore, real-world interactions require social robots to dynamically adapt to changing environmental and task settings. To facilitate this, we propose Federated Latent Generative Replay (FedLGR), a novel Federated Continual Learning (FCL) strategy that uses FedRoot-based weight aggregation and embeds each client with a generator model for pseudo-rehearsal of learnt feature embeddings to mitigate forgetting in a resource-efficient manner. Our benchmark results demonstrate that FedRoot-based FCL methods outperform other methods while also offering sizeable (up to 84% for CPU usage and up to 92% for GPU usage) reduction in resource consumption, with FedLGR providing the best results across evaluations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Energy-efficient AI Model Architectures and Compression Techniques for "Green" Fetal Brain Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence have contributed to advancements across various industries. However, the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies also raises concerns about their environmental impact, due to associated carbon footprints to train computational models. Fetal brain segmentation in medical imaging is challenging due to the small size of the fetal brain and the limited image quality of fast 2D sequences. Deep neural networks are a promising method to overcome this challenge. In this context, the construction of larger models requires extensive data and computing power, leading to high energy consumption. Our study aims to explore model architectures and compression techniques that promote energy efficiency by optimizing the trade-off between accuracy and energy consumption through various strategies such as lightweight network design, architecture search, and optimized distributed training tools. We have identified several effective strategies including optimization of data loading, modern optimizers, distributed training strategy implementation, and reduced floating point operations precision usage with light model architectures while tuning parameters according to available computer resources. Our findings demonstrate that these methods lead to satisfactory model performance with low energy consumption during deep neural network training for medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Sequence Length Scaling in Vision Transformers for Scientific Images on Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are pivotal for foundational models in scientific imagery, including Earth science applications, due to their capability to process large sequence lengths. While transformers for text has inspired scaling sequence lengths in ViTs, yet adapting these for ViTs introduces unique challenges. We develop distributed sequence parallelism for ViTs, enabling them to handle up to 1M tokens. Our approach, leveraging DeepSpeed-Ulysses and Long-Sequence-Segmentation with model sharding, is the first to apply sequence parallelism in ViT training, achieving a 94% batch scaling efficiency on 2,048 AMD-MI250X GPUs. Evaluating sequence parallelism in ViTs, particularly in models up to 10B parameters, highlighted substantial bottlenecks. We countered these with hybrid sequence, pipeline, tensor parallelism, and flash attention strategies, to scale beyond single GPU memory limits. Our method significantly enhances climate modeling accuracy by 20% in temperature predictions, marking the first training of a transformer model on a full-attention matrix over 188K sequence length.</description>

      <title>Towards Fairness in Provably Communication-Efficient Federated Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reduce the communication overhead caused by parallel training of multiple clients, various federated learning (FL) techniques use random client sampling. Nonetheless, ensuring the efficacy of random sampling and determining the optimal number of clients to sample in federated recommender systems (FRSs) remains challenging due to the isolated nature of each user as a separate client. This challenge is exacerbated in models where public and private features can be separated, and FL allows communication of only public features (item gradients). In this study, we establish sample complexity bounds that dictate the ideal number of clients required for improved communication efficiency and retained accuracy in such models. In line with our theoretical findings, we empirically demonstrate that RS-FairFRS reduces communication cost (~47%). Second, we demonstrate the presence of class imbalance among clients that raises a substantial equity concern for FRSs. Unlike centralized machine learning, clients in FRS can not share raw data, including sensitive attributes. For this, we introduce RS-FairFRS, first fairness under unawareness FRS built upon random sampling based FRS. While random sampling improves communication efficiency, we propose a novel two-phase dual-fair update technique to achieve fairness without revealing protected attributes of active clients participating in training. Our results on real-world datasets and different sensitive features illustrate a significant reduction in demographic bias (~approx40\%), offering a promising path to achieving fairness and communication efficiency in FRSs without compromising the overall accuracy of FRS.</description>

      <title>Semantic Objective Functions: A distribution-aware method for adding logical constraints in deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Issues of safety, explainability, and efficiency are of increasing concern in learning systems deployed with hard and soft constraints. Symbolic Constrained Learning and Knowledge Distillation techniques have shown promising results in this area, by embedding and extracting knowledge, as well as providing logical constraints during neural network training. Although many frameworks exist to date, through an integration of logic and information geometry, we provide a construction and theoretical framework for these tasks that generalize many approaches. We propose a loss-based method that embeds knowledge-enforces logical constraints-into a machine learning model that outputs probability distributions. This is done by constructing a distribution from the external knowledge/logic formula and constructing a loss function as a linear combination of the original loss function with the Fisher-Rao distance or Kullback-Leibler divergence to the constraint distribution. This construction includes logical constraints in the form of propositional formulas (Boolean variables), formulas of a first-order language with finite variables over a model with compact domain (categorical and continuous variables), and in general, likely applicable to any statistical model that was pretrained with semantic information. We evaluate our method on a variety of learning tasks, including classification tasks with logic constraints, transferring knowledge from logic formulas, and knowledge distillation from general distributions.</description>

Abstract: Software engineering is a challenging task requiring proficiency in both code generation and interacting with computers. In this paper, we introduce SWE-agent, an autonomous system that uses a language model to interact with a computer to solve software engineering tasks. We show that a custom-built agent-computer interface (ACI) greatly enhances the ability of an agent to create and edit code files, navigate entire repositories and execute programs. On SWE-bench, SWE-agent is able to solve 12.5% of issues, compared to the previous best of 3.8% achieved with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We explore how ACI design impacts an agent's behavior and performance, and provide insights on effective design.</description>

      <title>DSAM: A Deep Learning Framework for Analyzing Temporal and Spatial Dynamics in Brain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a noninvasive technique pivotal for understanding human neural mechanisms of intricate cognitive processes. Most rs-fMRI studies compute a single static functional connectivity matrix across brain regions of interest, or dynamic functional connectivity matrices with a sliding window approach. These approaches are at risk of oversimplifying brain dynamics and lack proper consideration of the goal at hand. While deep learning has gained substantial popularity for modeling complex relational data, its application to uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain is still limited. We propose a novel interpretable deep learning framework that learns goal-specific functional connectivity matrix directly from time series and employs a specialized graph neural network for the final classification. Our model, DSAM, leverages temporal causal convolutional networks to capture the temporal dynamics in both low- and high-level feature representations, a temporal attention unit to identify important time points, a self-attention unit to construct the goal-specific connectivity matrix, and a novel variant of graph neural network to capture the spatial dynamics for downstream classification. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset with 1075 samples to build and interpret the model for the classification of sex group, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset with 8520 samples for independent testing. Compared our proposed framework with other state-of-art models, results suggested this novel approach goes beyond the assumption of a fixed connectivity matrix and provides evidence of goal-specific brain connectivity patterns, which opens up the potential to gain deeper insights into how the human brain adapts its functional connectivity specific to the task at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, cognitive and computer scientists have viewed intelligence solipsistically, as a property of unitary agents devoid of social context. Given the success of contemporary learning algorithms, we argue that the bottleneck in artificial intelligence (AI) progress is shifting from data assimilation to novel data generation. We bring together evidence showing that natural intelligence emerges at multiple scales in networks of interacting agents via collective living, social relationships and major evolutionary transitions, which contribute to novel data generation through mechanisms such as population pressures, arms races, Machiavellian selection, social learning and cumulative culture. Many breakthroughs in AI exploit some of these processes, from multi-agent structures enabling algorithms to master complex games like Capture-The-Flag and StarCraft II, to strategic communication in Diplomacy and the shaping of AI data streams by other AIs. Moving beyond a solipsistic view of agency to integrate these mechanisms suggests a path to human-like compounding innovation through ongoing novel data generation.</description>

Abstract: We develop new algorithms for Riemannian bilevel optimization. We focus in particular on batch and stochastic gradient-based methods, with the explicit goal of avoiding second-order information such as Riemannian hyper-gradients. We propose and analyze $\mathrm{RF^2SA}$, a method that leverages first-order gradient information to navigate the complex geometry of Riemannian manifolds efficiently. Notably, $\mathrm{RF^2SA}$ is a single-loop algorithm, and thus easier to implement and use. Under various setups, including stochastic optimization, we provide explicit convergence rates for reaching $\epsilon$-stationary points. We also address the challenge of optimizing over Riemannian manifolds with constraints by adjusting the multiplier in the Lagrangian, ensuring convergence to the desired solution without requiring access to second-order derivatives.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing Language Agents via Policy Optimization with Action Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models as intelligent agents push the boundaries of sequential decision-making agents but struggle with limited knowledge of environmental dynamics and exponentially huge action space. Recent efforts like GLAM and TWOSOME manually constrain the action space to a restricted subset and employ reinforcement learning to align agents' knowledge with specific environments. However, they overlook fine-grained credit assignments for intra-action tokens, which is essential for efficient language agent optimization, and rely on human's prior knowledge to restrict action space. This paper proposes decomposing language agent optimization from the action level to the token level, offering finer supervision for each intra-action token and manageable optimization complexity in environments with unrestricted action spaces. Beginning with the simplification of flattening all actions, we theoretically explore the discrepancies between action-level optimization and this naive token-level optimization. We then derive the Bellman backup with Action Decomposition (BAD) to integrate credit assignments for both intra-action and inter-action tokens, effectively eliminating the discrepancies. Implementing BAD within the PPO algorithm, we introduce Policy Optimization with Action Decomposition (POAD). POAD benefits from a finer-grained credit assignment process and lower optimization complexity, leading to enhanced learning efficiency and generalization abilities in aligning language agents with interactive environments. We validate POAD across diverse testbeds, with results affirming the advantages of our approach and the correctness of our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Transmission Interface Power Flow Adjustment: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach based on Multi-task Attribution Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission interface power flow adjustment is a critical measure to ensure the security and economy operation of power systems. However, conventional model-based adjustment schemes are limited by the increasing variations and uncertainties occur in power systems, where the adjustment problems of different transmission interfaces are often treated as several independent tasks, ignoring their coupling relationship and even leading to conflict decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, to handle multiple power flow adjustment tasks jointly instead of learning each task from scratch. At the heart of the proposed method is a multi-task attribution map (MAM), which enables the DRL agent to explicitly attribute each transmission interface task to different power system nodes with task-adaptive attention weights. Based on this MAM, the agent can further provide effective strategies to solve the multi-task adjustment problem with a near-optimal operation cost. Simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a very large European system with 9241 buses demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance compared with several baseline methods, and exhibits high interpretability with the learnable MAM.</description>

Abstract: Gradient flows play a substantial role in addressing many machine learning problems. We examine the convergence in continuous-time of a \textit{Fisher-Rao} (Mean-Field Birth-Death) gradient flow in the context of solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization.

      <title>Learning the Language of Protein Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning and \emph{de novo} generation of proteins are pivotal computational biology tasks. Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \AA. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.</description>

      <title>Model Cascading for Code: Reducing Inference Costs with Model Cascading for LLM Based Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant advancements in code completion tasks. While larger models have higher accuracy, they also cost much more to run. Meanwhile, model cascading has been proven effective to conserve computational resources while enhancing accuracy in LLMs on natural language generation tasks. It generates output with the smallest model in a set, and only queries the larger models when it fails to meet predefined quality criteria. However, this strategy has not been used in code completion tasks, primarily because assessing the quality of code completions differs substantially from assessing natural language, where the former relies heavily on the functional correctness. To address this, we propose letting each model generate and execute a set of test cases for their solutions, and use the test results as the cascading threshold. We show that our model cascading strategy reduces computational costs while increases accuracy compared to generating the output with a single model. We also introduce a heuristics to determine the optimal combination of the number of solutions, test cases, and test lines each model should generate, based on the budget. Compared to speculative decoding, our method works on black-box models, having the same level of cost-accuracy trade-off, yet providing much more choices based on the server's budget. Ours is the first work to optimize cost-accuracy trade-off for LLM code generation with model cascading.</description>

      <title>LLS: Local Learning Rule for Deep Neural Networks Inspired by Neural Activity Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) using traditional backpropagation (BP) presents challenges in terms of computational complexity and energy consumption, particularly for on-device learning where computational resources are limited. Various alternatives to BP, including random feedback alignment, forward-forward, and local classifiers, have been explored to address these challenges. These methods have their advantages, but they can encounter difficulties when dealing with intricate visual tasks or demand considerable computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel Local Learning rule inspired by neural activity Synchronization phenomena (LLS) observed in the brain. LLS utilizes fixed periodic basis vectors to synchronize neuron activity within each layer, enabling efficient training without the need for additional trainable parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLS and its variations, LLS-M and LLS-MxM, on multiple image classification datasets, achieving accuracy comparable to BP with reduced computational complexity and minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, the performance of LLS on the Visual Wake Word (VWW) dataset highlights its suitability for on-device learning tasks, making it a promising candidate for edge hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Scaling Diffusion Mamba with Bidirectional SSMs for Efficient Image and Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent developments, the Mamba architecture, known for its selective state space approach, has shown potential in the efficient modeling of long sequences. However, its application in image generation remains underexplored. Traditional diffusion transformers (DiT), which utilize self-attention blocks, are effective but their computational complexity scales quadratically with the input length, limiting their use for high-resolution images. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion architecture, Diffusion Mamba (DiM), which foregoes traditional attention mechanisms in favor of a scalable alternative. By harnessing the inherent efficiency of the Mamba architecture, DiM achieves rapid inference times and reduced computational load, maintaining linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our architecture not only scales effectively but also outperforms existing diffusion transformers in both image and video generation tasks. The results affirm the scalability and efficiency of DiM, establishing a new benchmark for image and video generation techniques. This work advances the field of generative models and paves the way for further applications of scalable architectures.</description>

      <title>Score Distillation via Reparametrized DDIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) built on these 2D diffusion models produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems where the objective depends on some parameter, as commonly found in hyperparameter optimization for instance. We investigate the behavior of the derivatives of the iterates of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with respect to that parameter and show that they are driven by an inexact SGD recursion on a different objective function, perturbed by the convergence of the original SGD. This enables us to establish that the derivatives of SGD converge to the derivative of the solution mapping in terms of mean squared error whenever the objective is strongly convex. Specifically, we demonstrate that with constant step-sizes, these derivatives stabilize within a noise ball centered at the solution derivative, and that with vanishing step-sizes they exhibit $O(\log(k)^2 / k)$ convergence rates. Additionally, we prove exponential convergence in the interpolation regime. Our theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical experiments on synthetic tasks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Informed Auto-Penetration Testing Based on Reinforcement Learning with Reward Machine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) based on reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its ability to improve the efficiency of vulnerability identification in information systems. However, RL-based PT encounters several challenges, including poor sampling efficiency, intricate reward specification, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a knowledge-informed AutoPT framework called DRLRM-PT, which leverages reward machines (RMs) to encode domain knowledge as guidelines for training a PT policy. In our study, we specifically focus on lateral movement as a PT case study and formulate it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) guided by RMs. We design two RMs based on the MITRE ATT\&amp;CK knowledge base for lateral movement. To solve the POMDP and optimize the PT policy, we employ the deep Q-learning algorithm with RM (DQRM). The experimental results demonstrate that the DQRM agent exhibits higher training efficiency in PT compared to agents without knowledge embedding. Moreover, RMs encoding more detailed domain knowledge demonstrated better PT performance compared to RMs with simpler knowledge.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Neurosymbolic Programs via Compositional Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become an effective tool for automatically annotating unstructured data (e.g., images) with structured labels (e.g., object detections). As a result, a new programming paradigm called neurosymbolic programming has emerged where users write queries against these predicted annotations. However, due to the intrinsic fallibility of machine learning models, these programs currently lack any notion of correctness. In many domains, users may want some kind of conservative guarantee that the results of their queries contain all possibly relevant instances. Conformal prediction has emerged as a promising strategy for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning by modifying models to predict sets of labels instead of individual labels; it provides a probabilistic guarantee that the prediction set contains the true label with high probability. We propose a novel framework for adapting conformal prediction to neurosymbolic programs; our strategy is to represent prediction sets as abstract values in some abstract domain, and then to use abstract interpretation to propagate prediction sets through the program. Our strategy satisfies three key desiderata: (i) correctness (i.e., the program outputs a prediction set that contains the true output with high probability), (ii) compositionality (i.e., we can quantify uncertainty separately for different modules and then compose them together), and (iii) structured values (i.e., we can provide uncertainty quantification for structured values such as lists). When the full program is available ahead-of-time, we propose an optimization that incorporates conformal prediction at intermediate program points to reduce imprecision in abstract interpretation. We evaluate our approach on programs that take MNIST and MS-COCO images as input, demonstrating that it produces reasonably sized prediction sets while satisfying a coverage guarantee.</description>

      <title>PatchProt: Hydrophobic patch prediction using protein foundation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces play important functional roles in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Large hydrophobic surfaces are also involved in the progression of aggregation diseases. Predicting exposed hydrophobic patches from a protein sequence has been shown to be a difficult task. Fine-tuning foundation models allows for adapting a model to the specific nuances of a new task using a much smaller dataset. Additionally, multi-task deep learning offers a promising solution for addressing data gaps, simultaneously outperforming single-task methods. In this study, we harnessed a recently released leading large language model ESM-2. Efficient fine-tuning of ESM-2 was achieved by leveraging a recently developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. This approach enabled comprehensive training of model layers without excessive parameters and without the need to include a computationally expensive multiple sequence analysis. We explored several related tasks, at local (residue) and global (protein) levels, to improve the representation of the model. As a result, our fine-tuned ESM-2 model, PatchProt, cannot only predict hydrophobic patch areas but also outperforms existing methods at predicting primary tasks, including secondary structure and surface accessibility predictions. Importantly, our analysis shows that including related local tasks can improve predictions on more difficult global tasks. This research sets a new standard for sequence-based protein property prediction and highlights the remarkable potential of fine-tuning foundation models enriching the model representation by training over related tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a broad range of variations of the stochastic proximal point method (SPPM). Proximal point methods have attracted considerable interest owing to their numerical stability and robustness against imperfect tuning, a trait not shared by the dominant stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. A framework of assumptions that we introduce encompasses methods employing techniques such as variance reduction and arbitrary sampling. A cornerstone of our general theoretical approach is a parametric assumption on the iterates, correction and control vectors. We establish a single theorem that ensures linear convergence under this assumption and the $\mu$-strong convexity of the loss function, and without the need to invoke smoothness. This integral theorem reinstates best known complexity and convergence guarantees for several existing methods which demonstrates the robustness of our approach. We expand our study by developing three new variants of SPPM, and through numerical experiments we elucidate various properties inherent to them.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Bias of Machine Learning Regression Models and Its Correction: an Application to Imaging-based Brain Age Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models for continuous outcomes often yield systematically biased predictions, particularly for values that largely deviate from the mean. Specifically, predictions for large-valued outcomes tend to be negatively biased, while those for small-valued outcomes are positively biased. We refer to this linear central tendency warped bias as the "systematic bias of machine learning regression". In this paper, we first demonstrate that this issue persists across various machine learning models, and then delve into its theoretical underpinnings. We propose a general constrained optimization approach designed to correct this bias and develop a computationally efficient algorithm to implement our method. Our simulation results indicate that our correction method effectively eliminates the bias from the predicted outcomes. We apply the proposed approach to the prediction of brain age using neuroimaging data. In comparison to competing machine learning models, our method effectively addresses the longstanding issue of "systematic bias of machine learning regression" in neuroimaging-based brain age calculation, yielding unbiased predictions of brain age.</description>

Unfortunately, most of these models are black boxes, i.e., they are unable to reveal how they reach these prediction decisions. A need for transparency demands justification for such predictions. An affected individual might also desire explanations to understand why a decision was made. Ethical and legal considerations require informing the individual of changes in the input attribute (s) that could be made to produce a desirable outcome. Our work focuses on the latter problem of generating counterfactual explanations by considering the causal dependencies between features. In this paper, we present the framework CFGs, CounterFactual Generation with s(CASP), which utilizes the goal-directed Answer Set Programming (ASP) system s(CASP) to automatically generate counterfactual explanations from models generated by rule-based machine learning algorithms in particular. We benchmark CFGs with the FOLD-SE model. Reaching the counterfactual state from the initial state is planned and achieved using a series of interventions. To validate our proposal, we show how counterfactual explanations are computed and justified by imagining worlds where some or all factual assumptions are altered/changed. More importantly, we show how CFGs navigates between these worlds, namely, go from our initial state where we obtain an undesired outcome to the imagined goal state where we obtain the desired decision, taking into account the causal relationships among features.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision Language Models via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in various visual question-answering and reasoning tasks through vision instruction tuning on specific datasets. However, there is still significant room for improvement in the alignment between visual and language modalities. Previous methods to enhance this alignment typically require external models or data, heavily depending on their capabilities and quality, which inevitably sets an upper bound on performance. In this paper, we propose SIMA, a framework that enhances visual and language modality alignment through self-improvement, eliminating the needs for external models or data. SIMA leverages prompts from existing vision instruction tuning datasets to self-generate responses and employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for preference tuning. The key innovation is the introduction of three vision metrics during the in-context self-critic process, which can guide the LVLM in selecting responses that enhance image comprehension. Through experiments across 14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that SIMA not only improves model performance across all benchmarks but also achieves superior modality alignment, outperforming previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Inference of Utilities and Time Preference in Sequential Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stochastic control framework to enhance the capabilities of automated investment managers, or robo-advisors, by accurately inferring clients' investment preferences from past activities. Our approach leverages a continuous-time model that incorporates utility functions and a generic discounting scheme of a time-varying rate, tailored to each client's risk tolerance, valuation of daily consumption, and significant life goals. We address the resulting time inconsistency issue through state augmentation and the establishment of the dynamic programming principle and the verification theorem. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of client investment preferences. To complement our theoretical developments, we propose a learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation within a discrete-time Markov Decision Process framework, augmented with entropy regularization. We prove that the log-likelihood function is locally concave, facilitating the fast convergence of our proposed algorithm. Practical effectiveness and efficiency are showcased through two numerical examples, including Merton's problem and an investment problem with unhedgeable risks.
  Our proposed framework not only advances financial technology by improving personalized investment advice but also contributes broadly to other fields such as healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence, where understanding individual preferences is crucial.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Clustering via Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a local search algorithm for hierarchical clustering. For the local step, we consider a tree re-arrangement operation, known as the {\em interchange}, which involves swapping two closely positioned sub-trees within a tree hierarchy. The interchange operation has been previously used in the context of phylogenetic trees. As the objective function for evaluating the resulting hierarchies, we utilize the revenue function proposed by Moseley and Wang (NIPS 2017.)
  In our main result, we show that any locally optimal tree guarantees a revenue of at least $\frac{n-2}{3}\sum_{i &lt; j}w(i,j)$ where is $n$ the number of objects and $w: [n] \times [n] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ is the associated similarity function. This finding echoes the previously established bound for the average link algorithm as analyzed by Moseley and Wang. We demonstrate that this alignment is not coincidental, as the average link trees enjoy the property of being locally optimal with respect to the interchange operation. Consequently, our study provides an alternative insight into the average link algorithm and reveals the existence of a broader range of hierarchies with relatively high revenue achievable through a straightforward local search algorithm.
  Furthermore, we present an implementation of the local search framework, where each local step requires $O(n)$ computation time. Our empirical results indicate that the proposed method, used as post-processing step, can effectively generate a hierarchical clustering with substantial revenue.</description>

      <title>Carnatic Raga Identification System using Rigorous Time-Delay Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large scale machine learning-based Raga identification continues to be a nontrivial issue in the computational aspects behind Carnatic music. Each raga consists of many unique and intrinsic melodic patterns that can be used to easily identify them from others. These ragas can also then be used to cluster songs within the same raga, as well as identify songs in other closely related ragas. In this case, the input sound is analyzed using a combination of steps including using a Discrete Fourier transformation and using Triangular Filtering to create custom bins of possible notes, extracting features from the presence of particular notes or lack thereof. Using a combination of Neural Networks including 1D Convolutional Neural Networks conventionally known as Time-Delay Neural Networks) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which are a form of Recurrent Neural Networks, the backbone of the classification strategy to build the model can be created. In addition, to help with variations in shruti, a long-time attention-based mechanism will be implemented to determine the relative changes in frequency rather than the absolute differences. This will provide a much more meaningful data point when training audio clips in different shrutis. To evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, a dataset of 676 recordings is used. The songs are distributed across the list of ragas. The goal of this program is to be able to effectively and efficiently label a much wider range of audio clips in more shrutis, ragas, and with more background noise.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Heterogeneous Knowledge Concept Embedding for Cognitive Diagnosis on Untested Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis is a fundamental and critical task in learning assessment, which aims to infer students' proficiency on knowledge concepts from their response logs. Current works assume each knowledge concept will certainly be tested and covered by multiple exercises. However, whether online or offline courses, it's hardly feasible to completely cover all knowledge concepts in several exercises. Restricted tests lead to undiscovered knowledge deficits, especially untested knowledge concepts(UKCs). In this paper, we propose a novel \underline{Dis}entangling Heterogeneous \underline{K}nowledge \underline{C}ognitive \underline{D}iagnosis framework on untested knowledge(DisKCD). Specifically, we leverage course grades, exercise questions, and resources to learn the potential representations of students, exercises, and knowledge concepts. In particular, knowledge concepts are disentangled into tested and untested based on the limiting actual exercises. We construct a heterogeneous relation graph network via students, exercises, tested knowledge concepts(TKCs), and UKCs. Then, through a hierarchical heterogeneous message-passing mechanism, the fine-grained relations are incorporated into the embeddings of the entities. Finally, the embeddings will be applied to multiple existing cognitive diagnosis models to infer students' proficiency on UKCs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model can effectively improve the performance of the task of diagnosing students' proficiency on UKCs.

      <title>A Bi-Objective Approach to Last-Mile Delivery Routing Considering Driver Preferences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Objective Vehicle Routing Problem (MOVRP) is a complex optimization problem in the transportation and logistics industry. This paper proposes a novel approach to the MOVRP that aims to create routes that consider drivers' and operators' decisions and preferences. We evaluate two approaches to address this objective: visually attractive route planning and data mining of historical driver behavior to plan similar routes. Using a real-world dataset provided by Amazon, we demonstrate that data mining of historical patterns is more effective than visual attractiveness metrics found in the literature. Furthermore, we propose a bi-objective problem to balance the similarity of routes to historical routes and minimize routing costs. We propose a two-stage GRASP algorithm with heuristic box splitting to solve this problem. The proposed algorithm aims to approximate the Pareto front and to present routes that cover a wide range of the objective function space. The results demonstrate that our approach can generate a small number of non-dominated solutions per instance, which can help decision-makers to identify trade-offs between routing costs and drivers' preferences. Our approach has the potential to enhance the last-mile delivery operations of logistics companies by balancing these conflicting objectives.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning for Non-factorizable Models using Deep Generative Prior Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows for collaborative model training across decentralized clients while preserving privacy by avoiding data sharing. However, current FL methods assume conditional independence between client models, limiting the use of priors that capture dependence, such as Gaussian processes (GPs). We introduce the Structured Independence via deep Generative Model Approximation (SIGMA) prior which enables FL for non-factorizable models across clients, expanding the applicability of FL to fields such as spatial statistics, epidemiology, environmental science, and other domains where modeling dependencies is crucial. The SIGMA prior is a pre-trained deep generative model that approximates the desired prior and induces a specified conditional independence structure in the latent variables, creating an approximate model suitable for FL settings. We demonstrate the SIGMA prior's effectiveness on synthetic data and showcase its utility in a real-world example of FL for spatial data, using a conditional autoregressive prior to model spatial dependence across Australia. Our work enables new FL applications in domains where modeling dependent data is essential for accurate predictions and decision-making.</description>

      <title>SPP: Sparsity-Preserved Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing the field of artificial intelligence, yet their immense sizes pose significant challenges for both fine-tuning and deployment. Current post-training pruning methods, while reducing the sizes of LLMs, often fail to maintain their original performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SPP, a Sparsity-Preserved Parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Different from existing post-training pruning approaches that struggle with performance retention, SPP proposes to employ lightweight learnable column and row matrices to optimize sparse LLM weights, keeping the structure and sparsity of pruned pre-trained models intact. By element-wise multiplication and residual addition, SPP ensures the consistency of model sparsity pattern and ratio during both training and weight-merging processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPP by applying it to the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 model families with recent post-training pruning methods. Our results show that SPP significantly enhances the performance of models with different sparsity patterns (i.e. unstructured and N:M sparsity), especially for those with high sparsity ratios (e.g. 75%), making it a promising solution for the efficient fine-tuning of sparse LLMs. Code will be made available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/SPP.</description>

Abstract: The normal-inverse-Wishart (NIW) distribution is commonly used as a prior distribution for the mean and covariance parameters of a multivariate normal distribution. The family of NIW distributions is also a minimal exponential family. In this short note we describe a convergent procedure for converting from mean parameters to natural parameters in the NIW family, or -- equivalently -- for performing maximum likelihood estimation of the natural parameters given observed sufficient statistics. This is needed, for example, when using a NIW base family in expectation propagation</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Quaternion CNN and BiGRU with Cross Self-attention Feature Fusion for Fault Diagnosis of Bearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has led to significant advances in bearing fault diagnosis (FD). Most techniques aim to achieve greater accuracy. However, they are sensitive to noise and lack robustness, resulting in insufficient domain adaptation and anti-noise ability. The comparison of studies reveals that giving equal attention to all features does not differentiate their significance. In this work, we propose a novel FD model by integrating multi-scale quaternion convolutional neural network (MQCNN), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and cross self-attention feature fusion (CSAFF). We have developed innovative designs in two modules, namely MQCNN and CSAFF. Firstly, MQCNN applies quaternion convolution to multi-scale architecture for the first time, aiming to extract the rich hidden features of the original signal from multiple scales. Then, the extracted multi-scale information is input into CSAFF for feature fusion, where CSAFF innovatively incorporates cross self-attention mechanism to enhance discriminative interaction representation within features. Finally, BiGRU captures temporal dependencies while a softmax layer is employed for fault classification, achieving accurate FD. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we experiment on three public datasets (CWRU, MFPT, and Ottawa) and compare it with other excellent methods. The results confirm its state-of-the-art, which the average accuracies can achieve up to 99.99%, 100%, and 99.21% on CWRU, MFPT, and Ottawa datasets. Moreover, we perform practical tests and ablation experiments to validate the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach. Code is available at https://github.com/mubai011/MQCCAF.</description>

Abstract: The extraction and analysis of insights from medical data, primarily stored in free-text formats by healthcare workers, presents significant challenges due to its unstructured nature. Medical coding, a crucial process in healthcare, remains minimally automated due to the complexity of medical ontologies and restricted access to medical texts for training Natural Language Processing models. In this paper, we proposed a method, "SNOBERT," of linking text spans in clinical notes to specific concepts in the SNOMED CT using BERT-based models. The method consists of two stages: candidate selection and candidate matching. The models were trained on one of the largest publicly available dataset of labeled clinical notes. SNOBERT outperforms other classical methods based on deep learning, as confirmed by the results of a challenge in which it was applied.</description>

      <title>Prompt Optimization with EASE? Efficient Ordering-aware Automated Selection of Exemplars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in real-world applications. The capability of in-context learning (ICL) allows us to adapt an LLM to downstream tasks by including input-label exemplars in the prompt without model fine-tuning. However, the quality of these exemplars in the prompt greatly impacts performance, highlighting the need for an effective automated exemplar selection method. Recent studies have explored retrieval-based approaches to select exemplars tailored to individual test queries, which can be undesirable due to extra test-time computation and an increased risk of data exposure. Moreover, existing methods fail to adequately account for the impact of exemplar ordering on the performance. On the other hand, the impact of the instruction, another essential component in the prompt given to the LLM, is often overlooked in existing exemplar selection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named EASE, which leverages the hidden embedding from a pre-trained language model to represent ordered sets of exemplars and uses a neural bandit algorithm to optimize the sets of exemplars while accounting for exemplar ordering. Our EASE can efficiently find an ordered set of exemplars that performs well for all test queries from a given task, thereby eliminating test-time computation. Importantly, EASE can be readily extended to jointly optimize both the exemplars and the instruction. Through extensive empirical evaluations (including novel tasks), we demonstrate the superiority of EASE over existing methods, and reveal practical insights about the impact of exemplar selection on ICL, which may be of independent interest. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuanWu/EASE-Prompt-Optimization.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Minimax Optimization under the Second-Order Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed convex-concave minimax optimization under the second-order similarity. We propose stochastic variance-reduced optimistic gradient sliding (SVOGS) method, which takes the advantage of the finite-sum structure in the objective by involving the mini-batch client sampling and variance reduction. We prove SVOGS can achieve the $\varepsilon$-duality gap within communication rounds of ${\mathcal O}(\delta D^2/\varepsilon)$, communication complexity of ${\mathcal O}(n+\sqrt{n}\delta D^2/\varepsilon)$, and local gradient calls of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n+(\sqrt{n}\delta+L)D^2/\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ is the number of nodes, $\delta$ is the degree of the second-order similarity, $L$ is the smoothness parameter and $D$ is the diameter of the constraint set. We can verify that all of above complexity (nearly) matches the corresponding lower bounds. For the specific $\mu$-strongly-convex-$\mu$-strongly-convex case, our algorithm has the upper bounds on communication rounds, communication complexity, and local gradient calls of $\mathcal O(\delta/\mu\log(1/\varepsilon))$, ${\mathcal O}((n+\sqrt{n}\delta/\mu)\log(1/\varepsilon))$, and $\tilde{\mathcal O}(n+(\sqrt{n}\delta+L)/\mu)\log(1/\varepsilon))$ respectively, which are also nearly tight. Furthermore, we conduct the numerical experiments to show the empirical advantages of proposed method.</description>

      <title>C3LLM: Conditional Multimodal Content Generation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce C3LLM (Conditioned-on-Three-Modalities Large Language Models), a novel framework combining three tasks of video-to-audio, audio-to-text, and text-to-audio together. C3LLM adapts the Large Language Model (LLM) structure as a bridge for aligning different modalities, synthesizing the given conditional information, and making multimodal generation in a discrete manner. Our contributions are as follows. First, we adapt a hierarchical structure for audio generation tasks with pre-trained audio codebooks. Specifically, we train the LLM to generate audio semantic tokens from the given conditions, and further use a non-autoregressive transformer to generate different levels of acoustic tokens in layers to better enhance the fidelity of the generated audio. Second, based on the intuition that LLMs were originally designed for discrete tasks with the next-word prediction method, we use the discrete representation for audio generation and compress their semantic meanings into acoustic tokens, similar to adding "acoustic vocabulary" to LLM. Third, our method combines the previous tasks of audio understanding, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation together into one unified model, providing more versatility in an end-to-end fashion. Our C3LLM achieves improved results through various automated evaluation metrics, providing better semantic alignment compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Safe Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Lyapunov Functions</title>

Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has shown many desirable properties for intelligent control tasks. However, satisfying safety and stability constraints during training and rollout remains an open question. We propose a new Model-based RL framework to enable efficient policy learning with unknown dynamics based on learning model predictive control (LMPC) framework with mathematically provable guarantees of stability. We introduce and explore a novel method for adding safety constraints for model-based RL during training and policy learning. The new stability-augmented framework consists of a neural-network-based learner that learns to construct a Lyapunov function, and a model-based RL agent to consistently complete the tasks while satisfying user-specified constraints given only sub-optimal demonstrations and sparse-cost feedback. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework through simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning Visual-Semantic Subspace Representations for Propositional Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning representations that capture rich semantic relationships and accommodate propositional calculus poses a significant challenge. Existing approaches are either contrastive, lacking theoretical guarantees, or fall short in effectively representing the partial orders inherent to rich visual-semantic hierarchies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning visual representations that not only conform to a specified semantic structure but also facilitate probabilistic propositional reasoning. Our approach is based on a new nuclear norm-based loss. We show that its minimum encodes the spectral geometry of the semantics in a subspace lattice, where logical propositions can be represented by projection operators.</description>

      <title>Detecting Adversarial Data via Perturbation Forgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a defense strategy against adversarial attacks, adversarial detection aims to identify and filter out adversarial data from the data flow based on discrepancies in distribution and noise patterns between natural and adversarial data. Although previous detection methods achieve high performance in detecting gradient-based adversarial attacks, new attacks based on generative models with imbalanced and anisotropic noise patterns evade detection. Even worse, existing techniques either necessitate access to attack data before deploying a defense or incur a significant time cost for inference, rendering them impractical for defending against newly emerging attacks that are unseen by defenders. In this paper, we explore the proximity relationship between adversarial noise distributions and demonstrate the existence of an open covering for them. By learning to distinguish this open covering from the distribution of natural data, we can develop a detector with strong generalization capabilities against all types of adversarial attacks. Based on this insight, we heuristically propose Perturbation Forgery, which includes noise distribution perturbation, sparse mask generation, and pseudo-adversarial data production, to train an adversarial detector capable of detecting unseen gradient-based, generative-model-based, and physical adversarial attacks, while remaining agnostic to any specific models. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple general and facial datasets, with a wide spectrum of attacks, validate the strong generalization of our method.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for weak-to-strong generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large language model (LLM) alignment techniques rely on human feedback, but it is unclear whether the techniques fundamentally limit the capabilities of aligned LLMs. In particular, it is unclear whether it is possible to align (stronger) LLMs with superhuman capabilities with (weaker) human feedback without degrading their capabilities. This is an instance of the weak-to-strong generalization problem: using weaker (less capable) feedback to train a stronger (more capable) model. We prove that weak-to-strong generalization is possible by eliciting latent knowledge from pre-trained LLMs. In particular, we cast the weak-to-strong generalization problem as a transfer learning problem in which we wish to transfer a latent concept from a weak model to a strong pre-trained model. We prove that a naive fine-tuning approach suffers from fundamental limitations, but an alternative refinement-based approach suggested by the problem structure provably overcomes the limitations of fine-tuning. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the refinement approach with three LLM alignment tasks.</description>

      <title>Combining Radiomics and Machine Learning Approaches for Objective ASD Diagnosis: Verifying White Matter Associations with ASD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition characterized by a typical brain development leading to impairments in social skills, communication abilities, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing. There have been many studies combining brain MRI images with machine learning algorithms to achieve objective diagnosis of autism, but the correlation between white matter and autism has not been fully utilized. To address this gap, we develop a computer-aided diagnostic model focusing on white matter regions in brain MRI by employing radiomics and machine learning methods. This study introduced a MultiUNet model for segmenting white matter, leveraging the UNet architecture and utilizing manually segmented MRI images as the training data. Subsequently, we extracted white matter features using the Pyradiomics toolkit and applied different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict autism. The prediction sets all exceeded 80% accuracy. Additionally, we employed Convolutional Neural Network to analyze segmented white matter images, achieving a prediction accuracy of 86.84%. Notably, Support Vector Machine demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 89.47%. These findings not only underscore the efficacy of the models but also establish a link between white matter abnormalities and autism. Our study contributes to a comprehensive evaluation of various diagnostic models for autism and introduces a computer-aided diagnostic algorithm for early and objective autism diagnosis based on MRI white matter regions.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the front-propagation algorithm, a novel eXplainable AI (XAI) technique designed to elucidate the decision-making logic of deep neural networks. Unlike other popular explainability algorithms such as Integrated Gradients or Shapley Values, the proposed algorithm is able to extract an accurate and consistent linear function explanation of the network in a single forward pass of the trained model. This nuance sets apart the time complexity of the front-propagation as it could be running real-time and in parallel with deployed models. We packaged this algorithm in a software called $\texttt{front-prop}$ and we demonstrate its efficacy in providing accurate linear functions with three different neural network architectures trained on publicly available benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Consistency-Based Image Generation via Adversarialy-Trained Classification and Energy-Based Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced Consistency models pose an efficient alternative to diffusion algorithms, enabling rapid and good quality image synthesis. These methods overcome the slowness of diffusion models by directly mapping noise to data, while maintaining a (relatively) simpler training. Consistency models enable a fast one- or few-step generation, but they typically fall somewhat short in sample quality when compared to their diffusion origins. In this work we propose a novel and highly effective technique for post-processing Consistency-based generated images, enhancing their perceptual quality. Our approach utilizes a joint classifier-discriminator model, in which both portions are trained adversarially. While the classifier aims to grade an image based on its assignment to a designated class, the discriminator portion of the very same network leverages the softmax values to assess the proximity of the input image to the targeted data manifold, thereby serving as an Energy-based Model. By employing example-specific projected gradient iterations under the guidance of this joint machine, we refine synthesized images and achieve an improved FID scores on the ImageNet 64x64 dataset for both Consistency-Training and Consistency-Distillation techniques.</description>

Abstract: Collision-free motion is essential for mobile robots. Most approaches to collision-free and efficient navigation with wheeled robots require parameter tuning by experts to obtain good navigation behavior. This study investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning to train a mobile robot for autonomous navigation in a complex environment. The robot utilizes LiDAR sensor data and a deep neural network to generate control signals guiding it toward a specified target while avoiding obstacles. We employ two reinforcement learning algorithms in the Gazebo simulation environment: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and proximal policy optimization. The study introduces an enhanced neural network structure in the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to boost performance, accompanied by a well-designed reward function to improve algorithm efficacy. Experimental results conducted in both obstacle and obstacle-free environments underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This research significantly contributes to the advancement of autonomous robotics in complex environments through the application of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), showcasing advanced textual common-sense reasoning. However, applying this reasoning to multimodal domains, where understanding text and images together is essential, remains a substantial challenge. To address this, we introduce WinoVis, a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text-to-image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT-4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis, we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models' ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that, despite incremental advancements, Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.7% on WinoVis, only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text-to-image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.</description>

      <title>Confidence Under the Hood: An Investigation into the Confidence-Probability Alignment in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more widespread, understanding their self-evaluation of confidence in generated responses becomes increasingly important as it is integral to the reliability of the output of these models. We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's $\hat{\rho}$ of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.</description>

Abstract: We review recent developments of machine learning algorithms pertinent to the inverse renormalization group, which was originally established as a generative numerical method by Ron-Swendsen-Brandt via the implementation of compatible Monte Carlo simulations. Inverse renormalization group methods enable the iterative generation of configurations for increasing lattice size without the critical slowing down effect. We discuss the construction of inverse renormalization group transformations with the use of convolutional neural networks and present applications in models of statistical mechanics, lattice field theory, and disordered systems. We highlight the case of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson spin glass, where the inverse renormalization group can be employed to construct configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed by dedicated supercomputers.</description>

Abstract: Unstructured text in medical notes and dialogues contains rich information. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in question answering and summarization tasks on unstructured text data, outperforming traditional text analysis approaches. However, there is a lack of scientific studies in the literature that methodically evaluate and report on the performance of different LLMs, specifically for domain-specific data such as medical chart notes. We propose an evaluation approach to analyze the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama2 and Mistral for medical summarization tasks, using GPT-4 as an assessor. Our innovative approach to quantitative evaluation of LLMs can enable quality control, support the selection of effective LLMs for specific tasks, and advance knowledge discovery in digital health.</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Finely-Categorized Image-Text Retrieval by Selecting Hard Negative Unpaired Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Securing a sufficient amount of paired data is important to train an image-text retrieval (ITR) model, but collecting paired data is very expensive. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an active learning algorithm for ITR that can collect paired data cost-efficiently. Previous studies assume that image-text pairs are given and their category labels are asked to the annotator. However, in the recent ITR studies, the importance of category label is decreased since a retrieval model can be trained with only image-text pairs. For this reason, we set up an active learning scenario where unpaired images (or texts) are given and the annotator provides corresponding texts (or images) to make paired data. The key idea of the proposed AL algorithm is to select unpaired images (or texts) that can be hard negative samples for existing texts (or images). To this end, we introduce a novel scoring function to choose hard negative samples. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets.</description>

Our Python-based environment provides baseline implementations for learning control policies (either supervised or reinforcement learning based), a simulator based on PyBullet, data of solved instances using a classical motion planning solver, various representation learning methods for encoding the obstacles, and a clean interface between the learning and planning frameworks. Using RoboArm-NMP, we compare several prominent NMP design points, and demonstrate that the best methods mostly succeed in generalizing to unseen goals in a scene with fixed obstacles, but have difficulty in generalizing to unseen obstacle configurations, suggesting focus points for future research.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning is computationally intensive, with significant efforts focused on reducing arithmetic complexity, particularly regarding energy consumption dominated by data movement. While existing literature emphasizes inference, training is considerably more resource-intensive. This paper proposes a novel mathematical principle by introducing the notion of Boolean variation such that neurons made of Boolean weights and inputs can be trained -- for the first time -- efficiently in Boolean domain using Boolean logic instead of gradient descent and real arithmetic. We explore its convergence, conduct extensively experimental benchmarking, and provide consistent complexity evaluation by considering chip architecture, memory hierarchy, dataflow, and arithmetic precision. Our approach achieves baseline full-precision accuracy in ImageNet classification and surpasses state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation, with notable performance in image super-resolution, and natural language understanding with transformer-based models. Moreover, it significantly reduces energy consumption during both training and inference.</description>

      <title>A Second-Order perspective on Compositionality and Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fine-tuning of deep pre-trained models has recently revealed compositional properties. This enables the arbitrary composition of multiple specialized modules into a single, multi-task model. However, identifying the conditions that promote compositionality remains an open issue, with recent efforts concentrating mainly on linearized networks. We conduct a theoretical study that attempts to demystify compositionality in standard non-linear networks through the second-order Taylor approximation of the loss function. The proposed formulation highlights the importance of staying within the pre-training basin for achieving composable modules. Moreover, it provides the basis for two dual incremental training algorithms: the one from the perspective of multiple models trained individually, while the other aims to optimize the composed model as a whole. We probe their application in incremental classification tasks and highlight some valuable skills. In fact, the pool of incrementally learned modules not only supports the creation of an effective multi-task model but also enables unlearning and specialization in specific tasks.</description>

      <title>A Differential Equation Approach for Wasserstein GANs and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theoretical lens to view Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs). In our framework, we define a discretization inspired by a distribution-dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE). We show that such a discretization is convergent and propose a viable class of adversarial training methods to implement this discretization, which we call W1 Forward Euler (W1-FE). In particular, the ODE framework allows us to implement persistent training, a novel training technique that cannot be applied to typical WGAN algorithms without the ODE interpretation. Remarkably, when we do not implement persistent training, we prove that our algorithms simplify to existing WGAN algorithms; when we increase the level of persistent training appropriately, our algorithms outperform existing WGAN algorithms in both low- and high-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Reverse Transition Kernel: A Flexible Framework to Accelerate Diffusion Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To generate data from trained diffusion models, most inference algorithms, such as DDPM, DDIM, and other variants, rely on discretizing the reverse SDEs or their equivalent ODEs. In this paper, we view such approaches as decomposing the entire denoising diffusion process into several segments, each corresponding to a reverse transition kernel (RTK) sampling subproblem. Specifically, DDPM uses a Gaussian approximation for the RTK, resulting in low per-subproblem complexity but requiring a large number of segments (i.e., subproblems), which is conjectured to be inefficient. To address this, we develop a general RTK framework that enables a more balanced subproblem decomposition, resulting in $\tilde O(1)$ subproblems, each with strongly log-concave targets. We then propose leveraging two fast sampling algorithms, the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Underdamped Langevin Dynamics (ULD), for solving these strongly log-concave subproblems. This gives rise to the RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD algorithms for diffusion inference. In theory, we further develop the convergence guarantees for RTK-MALA and RTK-ULD in total variation (TV) distance: RTK-ULD can achieve $\epsilon$ target error within $\tilde{\mathcal O}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ under mild conditions, and RTK-MALA enjoys a $\mathcal{O}(d^{2}\log(d/\epsilon))$ convergence rate under slightly stricter conditions. These theoretical results surpass the state-of-the-art convergence rates for diffusion inference and are well supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Reference Preference Optimization for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can Large Language Models (LLMs) be aligned with human intentions and values? A typical solution is to gather human preference on model outputs and finetune the LLMs accordingly while ensuring that updates do not deviate too far from a reference model. Recent approaches, such as direct preference optimization (DPO), have eliminated the need for unstable and sluggish reinforcement learning optimization by introducing close-formed supervised losses. However, a significant limitation of the current approach is its design for a single reference model only, neglecting to leverage the collective power of numerous pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel closed-form formulation for direct preference optimization using multiple reference models. The resulting algorithm, Multi-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO), leverages broader prior knowledge from diverse reference models, substantially enhancing preference learning capabilities compared to the single-reference DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned with MRPO generalize better in various preference data, regardless of data scarcity or abundance. Furthermore, MRPO effectively finetunes LLMs to exhibit superior performance in several downstream natural language processing tasks such as GSM8K and TruthfulQA.</description>

      <title>Safe and Balanced: A Framework for Constrained Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In numerous reinforcement learning (RL) problems involving safety-critical systems, a key challenge lies in balancing multiple objectives while simultaneously meeting all stringent safety constraints. To tackle this issue, we propose a primal-based framework that orchestrates policy optimization between multi-objective learning and constraint adherence. Our method employs a novel natural policy gradient manipulation method to optimize multiple RL objectives and overcome conflicting gradients between different tasks, since the simple weighted average gradient direction may not be beneficial for specific tasks' performance due to misaligned gradients of different task objectives. When there is a violation of a hard constraint, our algorithm steps in to rectify the policy to minimize this violation. We establish theoretical convergence and constraint violation guarantees in a tabular setting. Empirically, our proposed method also outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on challenging safe multi-objective reinforcement learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of using Semantically Meaningful Tokens for Visual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision transformers have established a precedent of patchifying images into uniformly-sized chunks before processing. We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores. Our experiments on COCO demonstrate notable improvements over ViTs in learned representation quality across text-to-image (+47%) and image-to-text retrieval (+44%) tasks. Furthermore, we showcase the advantages on compositionality benchmarks such as ARO (+18%) and Winoground (+10%).</description>

      <title>Network Interdiction Goes Neural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network interdiction problems are combinatorial optimization problems involving two players: one aims to solve an optimization problem on a network, while the other seeks to modify the network to thwart the first player's objectives. Such problems typically emerge in an attacker-defender context, encompassing areas such as military operations, disease spread analysis, and communication network management. The primary bottleneck in network interdiction arises from the high time complexity of using conventional exact solvers and the challenges associated with devising efficient heuristic solvers. GNNs, recognized as a cutting-edge methodology, have shown significant effectiveness in addressing single-level CO problems on graphs, such as the traveling salesman problem, graph matching, and graph edit distance. Nevertheless, network interdiction presents a bi-level optimization challenge, which current GNNs find difficult to manage. To address this gap, we represent network interdiction problems as Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) instances, then apply a multipartite GNN with sufficient representational capacity to learn these formulations. This approach ensures that our neural network is more compatible with the mathematical algorithms designed to solve network interdiction problems, resulting in improved generalization. Through two distinct tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms theoretical baseline models and provides advantages over traditional exact solvers.</description>

      <title>KG-FIT: Knowledge Graph Fine-Tuning Upon Open-World Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques are crucial in learning compact representations of entities and relations within a knowledge graph, facilitating efficient reasoning and knowledge discovery. While existing methods typically focus either on training KGE models solely based on graph structure or fine-tuning pre-trained language models with classification data in KG, KG-FIT leverages LLM-guided refinement to construct a semantically coherent hierarchical structure of entity clusters. By incorporating this hierarchical knowledge along with textual information during the fine-tuning process, KG-FIT effectively captures both global semantics from the LLM and local semantics from the KG. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets FB15K-237, YAGO3-10, and PrimeKG demonstrate the superiority of KG-FIT over state-of-the-art pre-trained language model-based methods, achieving improvements of 14.4%, 13.5%, and 11.9% in the Hits@10 metric for the link prediction task, respectively. Furthermore, KG-FIT yields substantial performance gains of 12.6%, 6.7%, and 17.7% compared to the structure-based base models upon which it is built. These results highlight the effectiveness of KG-FIT in incorporating open-world knowledge from LLMs to significantly enhance the expressiveness and informativeness of KG embeddings.</description>

      <title>Augmented Risk Prediction for the Onset of Alzheimer's Disease from Electronic Health Records with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fifth-leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. Screening and early detection of AD and related dementias (ADRD) are critical for timely intervention and for identifying clinical trial participants. The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers an important resource for developing ADRD screening tools such as machine learning based predictive models. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their unprecedented capability of encoding knowledge and performing reasoning, which offers them strong potential for enhancing risk prediction. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that augments risk prediction by leveraging the few-shot inference power of LLMs to make predictions on cases where traditional supervised learning methods (SLs) may not excel. Specifically, we develop a collaborative pipeline that combines SLs and LLMs via a confidence-driven decision-making mechanism, leveraging the strengths of SLs in clear-cut cases and LLMs in more complex scenarios. We evaluate this pipeline using a real-world EHR data warehouse from Oregon Health \&amp; Science University (OHSU) Hospital, encompassing EHRs from over 2.5 million patients and more than 20 million patient encounters. Our results show that our proposed approach effectively combines the power of SLs and LLMs, offering significant improvements in predictive performance. This advancement holds promise for revolutionizing ADRD screening and early detection practices, with potential implications for better strategies of patient management and thus improving healthcare.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Text Detection and Classification Based on BERT Deep Learning Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI-generated text detection plays an increasingly important role in various fields. In this study, we developed an efficient AI-generated text detection model based on the BERT algorithm, which provides new ideas and methods for solving related problems. In the data preprocessing stage, a series of steps were taken to process the text, including operations such as converting to lowercase, word splitting, removing stop words, stemming extraction, removing digits, and eliminating redundant spaces, to ensure data quality and accuracy. By dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set in the ratio of 60% and 40%, and observing the changes in the accuracy and loss values during the training process, we found that the model performed well during the training process. The accuracy increases steadily from the initial 94.78% to 99.72%, while the loss value decreases from 0.261 to 0.021 and converges gradually, which indicates that the BERT model is able to detect AI-generated text with high accuracy and the prediction results are gradually approaching the real classification results. Further analysis of the results of the training and test sets reveals that in terms of loss value, the average loss of the training set is 0.0565, while the average loss of the test set is 0.0917, showing a slightly higher loss value. As for the accuracy, the average accuracy of the training set reaches 98.1%, while the average accuracy of the test set is 97.71%, which is not much different from each other, indicating that the model has good generalisation ability. In conclusion, the AI-generated text detection model based on the BERT algorithm proposed in this study shows high accuracy and stability in experiments, providing an effective solution for related fields.</description>

Abstract: With advanced AI/ML, there has been growing research on explainable AI (XAI) and studies on how humans interact with AI and XAI for effective human-AI collaborative decision-making. However, we still have a lack of understanding of how AI systems and XAI should be first presented to users without technical backgrounds. In this paper, we present the findings of semi-structured interviews with health professionals (n=12) and students (n=4) majoring in medicine and health to study how to improve onboarding with AI and XAI. For the interviews, we built upon human-AI interaction guidelines to create onboarding materials of an AI system for stroke rehabilitation assessment and AI explanations and introduce them to the participants. Our findings reveal that beyond presenting traditional performance metrics on AI, participants desired benchmark information, the practical benefits of AI, and interaction trials to better contextualize AI performance, and refine the objectives and performance of AI. Based on these findings, we highlight directions for improving onboarding with AI and XAI and human-AI collaborative decision-making.</description>

      <title>Towards Imitation Learning in Real World Unstructured Social Mini-Games in Pedestrian Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) strategies are used to generate policies for robot motion planning and navigation by learning from human trajectories. Recently, there has been a lot of excitement in applying IL in social interactions arising in urban environments such as university campuses, restaurants, grocery stores, and hospitals. However, obtaining numerous expert demonstrations in social settings might be expensive, risky, or even impossible. Current approaches therefore, focus only on simulated social interaction scenarios. This raises the question: \textit{How can a robot learn to imitate an expert demonstrator from real world multi-agent social interaction scenarios}? It remains unknown which, if any, IL methods perform well and what assumptions they require. We benchmark representative IL methods in real world social interaction scenarios on a motion planning task, using a novel pedestrian intersection dataset collected at the University of Texas at Austin campus. Our evaluation reveals two key findings: first, learning multi-agent cost functions is required for learning the diverse behavior modes of agents in tightly coupled interactions and second, conditioning the training of IL methods on partial state information or providing global information in simulation can improve imitation learning, especially in real world social interaction scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative method for incremental nonparametric probabilistic inference in high-dimensional state spaces. Our approach leverages \slices from high-dimensional surfaces to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of any shape. Unlike many existing graph-based methods, our \slices perspective eliminates the need for additional intermediate reconstructions, maintaining a more accurate representation of posterior distributions. Additionally, we propose a novel heuristic to balance between accuracy and efficiency, enabling real-time operation in nonparametric scenarios. In empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, our \slices approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. It demonstrates superior accuracy and achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, often by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On the Algorithmic Bias of Aligning Large Language Models with RLHF: Preference Collapse and Matching Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for informing fair, economically sound, and statistically efficient decision-making processes. However, we argue that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- the predominant approach for aligning LLMs with human preferences through a reward model -- suffers from an inherent algorithmic bias due to its Kullback--Leibler-based regularization in optimization. In extreme cases, this bias could lead to a phenomenon we term preference collapse, where minority preferences are virtually disregarded. To mitigate this algorithmic bias, we introduce preference matching (PM) RLHF, a novel approach that provably aligns LLMs with the preference distribution of the reward model under the Bradley--Terry--Luce/Plackett--Luce model. Central to our approach is a PM regularizer that takes the form of the negative logarithm of the LLM's policy probability distribution over responses, which helps the LLM balance response diversification and reward maximization. Notably, we obtain this regularizer by solving an ordinary differential equation that is necessary for the PM property. For practical implementation, we introduce a conditional variant of PM RLHF that is tailored to natural language generation. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of conditional PM RLHF through experiments on the OPT-1.3B and Llama-2-7B models, demonstrating a 29% to 41% improvement in alignment with human preferences, as measured by a certain metric, compared to standard RLHF.</description>

      <title>KiNETGAN: Enabling Distributed Network Intrusion Detection through Knowledge-Infused Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of IoT/CPS systems connected over mobile networks, traditional intrusion detection methods analyze network traffic across multiple devices using anomaly detection techniques to flag potential security threats. However, these methods face significant privacy challenges, particularly with deep packet inspection and network communication analysis. This type of monitoring is highly intrusive, as it involves examining the content of data packets, which can include personal and sensitive information. Such data scrutiny is often governed by stringent laws and regulations, especially in environments like smart homes where data privacy is paramount. Synthetic data offers a promising solution by mimicking real network behavior without revealing sensitive details. Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can produce synthetic data, but they often struggle to generate realistic data in specialized domains like network activity. This limitation stems from insufficient training data, which impedes the model's ability to grasp the domain's rules and constraints adequately. Moreover, the scarcity of training data exacerbates the problem of class imbalance in intrusion detection methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Driven framework that utilizes a knowledge-infused Generative Adversarial Network for generating synthetic network activity data (KiNETGAN). This approach enhances the resilience of distributed intrusion detection while addressing privacy concerns. Our Knowledge Guided GAN produces realistic representations of network activity, validated through rigorous experimentation. We demonstrate that KiNETGAN maintains minimal accuracy loss in downstream tasks, effectively balancing data privacy and utility.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Multimodal Fusion-based Deep Learning Network for Detecting Facial Palsy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic detection of facial palsy offers the potential to improve current practices, which usually involve labor-intensive and subjective assessment by clinicians. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion-based deep learning model that utilizes unstructured data (i.e. an image frame with facial line segments) and structured data (i.e. features of facial expressions) to detect facial palsy. We then contribute to a study to analyze the effect of different data modalities and the benefits of a multimodal fusion-based approach using videos of 21 facial palsy patients. Our experimental results show that among various data modalities (i.e. unstructured data - RGB images and images of facial line segments and structured data - coordinates of facial landmarks and features of facial expressions), the feed-forward neural network using features of facial expression achieved the highest precision of 76.22 while the ResNet-based model using images of facial line segments achieved the highest recall of 83.47. When we leveraged both images of facial line segments and features of facial expressions, our multimodal fusion-based deep learning model slightly improved the precision score to 77.05 at the expense of a decrease in the recall score.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the motion of multiple biological agents, be it cells or individual animals, is pivotal for the understanding of complex collective behaviors. With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-Task Planning for Language Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural language models has sparked a new surge of intelligent agent research. Unlike traditional agents, large language model-based agents (LLM agents) have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) due to their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. Effective planning is crucial for the success of LLM agents in real-world tasks, making it a highly pursued topic in the community. Current planning methods typically translate tasks into executable action sequences. However, determining a feasible or optimal sequence for complex tasks at fine granularity, which often requires compositing long chains of heterogeneous actions, remains challenging. This paper introduces Meta-Task Planning (MTP), a zero-shot methodology for collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems that simplifies complex task planning by decomposing it into a hierarchy of subordinate tasks, or meta-tasks. Each meta-task is then mapped into executable actions. MTP was assessed on two rigorous benchmarks, TravelPlanner and API-Bank. Notably, MTP achieved an average $\sim40\%$ success rate on TravelPlanner, significantly higher than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline ($2.92\%$), and outperforming $LLM_{api}$-4 with ReAct on API-Bank by $\sim14\%$, showing the immense potential of integrating LLM with multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reducing Couplings for Random Features: Perspectives from Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random features (RFs) are a popular technique to scale up kernel methods in machine learning, replacing exact kernel evaluations with stochastic Monte Carlo estimates. They underpin models as diverse as efficient transformers (by approximating attention) to sparse spectrum Gaussian processes (by approximating the covariance function). Efficiency can be further improved by speeding up the convergence of these estimates: a variance reduction problem. We tackle this through the unifying framework of optimal transport, using theoretical insights and numerical algorithms to develop novel, high-performing RF couplings for kernels defined on Euclidean and discrete input spaces. They enjoy concrete theoretical performance guarantees and sometimes provide strong empirical downstream gains, including for scalable approximate inference on graphs. We reach surprising conclusions about the benefits and limitations of variance reduction as a paradigm.</description>

      <title>Contextual Linear Optimization with Bandit Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual linear optimization (CLO) uses predictive observations to reduce uncertainty in random cost coefficients and thereby improve average-cost performance. An example is a stochastic shortest path with random edge costs (e.g., traffic) and predictive features (e.g., lagged traffic, weather). Existing work on CLO assumes the data has fully observed cost coefficient vectors, but in many applications, we can only see the realized cost of a historical decision, that is, just one projection of the random cost coefficient vector, to which we refer as bandit feedback. We study a class of algorithms for CLO with bandit feedback, which we term induced empirical risk minimization (IERM), where we fit a predictive model to directly optimize the downstream performance of the policy it induces. We show a fast-rate regret bound for IERM that allows for misspecified model classes and flexible choices of the optimization estimate, and we develop computationally tractable surrogate losses. A byproduct of our theory of independent interest is fast-rate regret bound for IERM with full feedback and misspecified policy class. We compare the performance of different modeling choices numerically using a stochastic shortest path example and provide practical insights from the empirical results.</description>

      <title>Reflected Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) learn an ordinary differential equation to transform prior samples into data. Flow matching (FM) has recently emerged as a simulation-free approach for training CNFs by regressing a velocity model towards the conditional velocity field. However, on constrained domains, the learned velocity model may lead to undesirable flows that result in highly unnatural samples, e.g., oversaturated images, due to both flow matching error and simulation error. To address this, we add a boundary constraint term to CNFs, which leads to reflected CNFs that keep trajectories within the constrained domains. We propose reflected flow matching (RFM) to train the velocity model in reflected CNFs by matching the conditional velocity fields in a simulation-free manner, similar to the vanilla FM. Moreover, the analytical form of conditional velocity fields in RFM avoids potentially biased approximations, making it superior to existing score-based generative models on constrained domains. We demonstrate that RFM achieves comparable or better results on standard image benchmarks and produces high-quality class-conditioned samples under high guidance weight.</description>

      <title>A Study on Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Defect Localization using Generative Model in Ultrasonic Non-Destructive Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the deterioration of artificial materials used in structures has become a serious social issue, increasing the importance of inspections. Non-destructive testing is gaining increased demand due to its capability to inspect for defects and deterioration in structures while preserving their functionality. Among these, Laser Ultrasonic Visualization Testing (LUVT) stands out because it allows the visualization of ultrasonic propagation. This makes it visually straightforward to detect defects, thereby enhancing inspection efficiency. With the increasing number of the deterioration structures, challenges such as a shortage of inspectors and increased workload in non-destructive testing have become more apparent. Efforts to address these challenges include exploring automated inspection using machine learning. However, the lack of anomalous data with defects poses a barrier to improving the accuracy of automated inspection through machine learning. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for automated LUVT inspection using an anomaly detection approach with a diffusion model that can be trained solely on negative examples (defect-free data). We experimentally confirmed that our proposed method improves defect detection and localization compared to general object detection algorithms used previously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training-conditional coverage guarantees in conformal prediction concern the concentration of the error distribution, conditional on the training data, below some nominal level. The conformal prediction methodology has recently been generalized to the covariate shift setting, namely, the covariate distribution changes between the training and test data. In this paper, we study the training-conditional coverage properties of a range of conformal prediction methods under covariate shift via a weighted version of the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality tailored for distribution change. The result for the split conformal method is almost assumption-free, while the results for the full conformal and jackknife+ methods rely on strong assumptions including the uniform stability of the training algorithm.</description>

      <title>The devil is in discretization discrepancy. Robustifying Differentiable NAS with Single-Stage Searching Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been widely adopted to design neural networks for various computer vision tasks. One of its most promising subdomains is differentiable NAS (DNAS), where the optimal architecture is found in a differentiable manner. However, gradient-based methods suffer from the discretization error, which can severely damage the process of obtaining the final architecture. In our work, we first study the risk of discretization error and show how it affects an unregularized supernet. Then, we present that penalizing high entropy, a common technique of architecture regularization, can hinder the supernet's performance. Therefore, to robustify the DNAS framework, we introduce a novel single-stage searching protocol, which is not reliant on decoding a continuous architecture. Our results demonstrate that this approach outperforms other DNAS methods by achieving 75.3% in the searching stage on the Cityscapes validation dataset and attains performance 1.1% higher than the optimal network of DCNAS on the non-dense search space comprising short connections. The entire training process takes only 5.5 GPU days due to the weight reuse, and yields a computationally efficient architecture. Additionally, we propose a new dataset split procedure, which substantially improves results and prevents architecture degeneration in DARTS.</description>

      <title>Competing for pixels: a self-play algorithm for weakly-supervised segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) methods, reliant on image-level labels indicating object presence, lack explicit correspondence between labels and regions of interest (ROIs), posing a significant challenge. Despite this, WSS methods have attracted attention due to their much lower annotation costs compared to fully-supervised segmentation. Leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) self-play, we propose a novel WSS method that gamifies image segmentation of a ROI. We formulate segmentation as a competition between two agents that compete to select ROI-containing patches until exhaustion of all such patches. The score at each time-step, used to compute the reward for agent training, represents likelihood of object presence within the selection, determined by an object presence detector pre-trained using only image-level binary classification labels of object presence. Additionally, we propose a game termination condition that can be called by either side upon exhaustion of all ROI-containing patches, followed by the selection of a final patch from each. Upon termination, the agent is incentivised if ROI-containing patches are exhausted or disincentivised if an ROI-containing patch is found by the competitor. This competitive setup ensures minimisation of over- or under-segmentation, a common problem with WSS methods. Extensive experimentation across four datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods. Code: https://github.com/s-sd/spurl/tree/main/wss</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference with Deep Weakly Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show at a physics level of rigor that Bayesian inference with a fully connected neural network and a shaped nonlinearity of the form $\phi(t) = t + \psi t^3/L$ is (perturbatively) solvable in the regime where the number of training datapoints $P$ , the input dimension $N_0$, the network layer widths $N$, and the network depth $L$ are simultaneously large. Our results hold with weak assumptions on the data; the main constraint is that $P &lt; N_0$. We provide techniques to compute the model evidence and posterior to arbitrary order in $1/N$ and at arbitrary temperature. We report the following results from the first-order computation:
  1. When the width $N$ is much larger than the depth $L$ and training set size $P$, neural network Bayesian inference coincides with Bayesian inference using a kernel. The value of $\psi$ determines the curvature of a sphere, hyperbola, or plane into which the training data is implicitly embedded under the feature map.
  2. When $LP/N$ is a small constant, neural network Bayesian inference departs from the kernel regime. At zero temperature, neural network Bayesian inference is equivalent to Bayesian inference using a data-dependent kernel, and $LP/N$ serves as an effective depth that controls the extent of feature learning.
  3. In the restricted case of deep linear networks ($\psi=0$) and noisy data, we show a simple data model for which evidence and generalization error are optimal at zero temperature. As $LP/N$ increases, both evidence and generalization further improve, demonstrating the benefit of depth in benign overfitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the Berry-Esseen bound for multivariate normal approximation for the Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates of the linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. Our findings reveal that the fastest rate of normal approximation is achieved when setting the most aggressive step size $\alpha_{k} \asymp k^{-1/2}$. Moreover, we prove the non-asymptotic validity of the confidence intervals for parameter estimation with LSA based on multiplier bootstrap. This procedure updates the LSA estimate together with a set of randomly perturbed LSA estimates upon the arrival of subsequent observations. We illustrate our findings in the setting of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.</description>

      <title>Predicting Likely-Vulnerable Code Changes: Machine Learning-based Vulnerability Protections for Android Open Source Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework that selectively triggers security reviews for incoming source code changes. Functioning as a review bot within a code review service, the framework can automatically request additional security reviews at pre-submit time before the code changes are submitted to a source code repository. Because performing such secure code reviews add cost, the framework employs a classifier trained to identify code changes with a high likelihood of vulnerabilities. The online classifier leverages various types of input features to analyze the review patterns, track the software engineering process, and mine specific text patterns within given code changes. The classifier and its features are meticulously chosen and optimized using data from the submitted code changes and reported vulnerabilities in Android Open Source Project (AOSP). The evaluation results demonstrate that our Vulnerability Prevention (VP) framework identifies approximately 80% of the vulnerability-inducing code changes in the dataset with a precision ratio of around 98% and a false positive rate of around 1.7%. We discuss the implications of deploying the VP framework in multi-project settings and future directions for Android security research. This paper explores and validates our approach to code change-granularity vulnerability prediction, offering a preventive technique for software security by preemptively detecting vulnerable code changes before submission.</description>

      <title>RLSF: Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have had a dramatic impact on various sub-fields of AI, most notably on natural language understanding tasks. However, there is widespread agreement that the logical reasoning capabilities of contemporary LLMs are, at best, fragmentary (i.e., may work well on some problem instances but fail dramatically on others). While traditional LLM fine-tuning approaches (e.g., those that use human feedback) do address this problem to some degree, they suffer from many issues, including unsound black-box reward models, difficulties in collecting preference data, and sparse scalar reward values.
  To address these challenges, we propose a new training/fine-tuning paradigm we refer to as Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), which is aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In the RLSF setting, the LLM that is being trained/fine-tuned is considered as the RL agent, while the environment is allowed access to reasoning or domain knowledge tools (e.g., solvers, algebra systems). Crucially, in RLSF, these reasoning tools can provide feedback to the LLMs via poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs), that characterize errors in the LLM-generated object with respect to some correctness specification. The ability of RLSF-based training/fine-tuning to leverage certificate-generating symbolic tools enables sound fine-grained (token-level) reward signals to LLMs, and thus addresses the limitations of traditional reward models mentioned above. Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs outperforms traditional approaches on two different applications, namely, program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language (C++) and solving the Game of 24.</description>

Abstract: We give the first polynomial-time, differentially node-private, and robust algorithm for estimating the edge density of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and their generalization, inhomogeneous random graphs. We further prove information-theoretical lower bounds, showing that the error rate of our algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Previous algorithms incur either exponential running time or suboptimal error rates.
  Two key ingredients of our algorithm are (1) a new sum-of-squares algorithm for robust edge density estimation, and (2) the reduction from privacy to robustness based on sum-of-squares exponential mechanisms due to Hopkins et al. (STOC 2023).</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Under High-Dimensional Graph Convolutional Regression Model for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental task, but obtaining node classification labels can be challenging and expensive in many real-world scenarios. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by leveraging knowledge from source domains to enhance learning in a target domain. Existing transfer learning methods for node classification primarily focus on integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with various transfer learning techniques. While these approaches have shown promising results, they often suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees, restrictive conditions, and high sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Graph Convolutional Multinomial Logistic Regression (GCR) model and a transfer learning method based on the GCR model, called Trans-GCR. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimate obtained under GCR model in high-dimensional settings. Moreover, Trans-GCR demonstrates superior empirical performance, has a low computational cost, and requires fewer hyperparameters than existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Facial Recognition is a technique, based on machine learning technology that can recognize a human being analyzing his facial profile, and is applied in solving various types of realworld problems nowadays. In this paper, a common real-world problem, finding a missing person has been solved in a secure and effective way with the help of facial recognition technology. Although there exist a few works on solving the problem, the proposed work is unique with respect to its security, design, and feasibility. Impeding intruders in participating in the processes and giving importance to both finders and family members of a missing person are two of the major features of this work. The proofs of the works of our system in finding a missing person have been described in the result section of the paper. The advantages that our system provides over the other existing systems can be realized from the comparisons, described in the result summary section of the paper. The work is capable of providing a worthy solution to find a missing person on the digital platform.</description>

      <title>gzip Predicts Data-dependent Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Past work has established scaling laws that predict the performance of a neural language model (LM) as a function of its parameter count and the number of tokens it's trained on, enabling optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Are these scaling laws agnostic to training data as some prior work suggests? We generate training datasets of varying complexities by modulating the syntactic properties of a PCFG, finding that 1) scaling laws are sensitive to differences in data complexity and that 2) gzip, a compression algorithm, is an effective predictor of how data complexity impacts scaling properties. We propose a new data-dependent scaling law for LM's that accounts for the training data's gzip-compressibility; its compute-optimal frontier increases in dataset size preference (over parameter count preference) as training data becomes harder to compress.</description>

      <title>Implicit Multimodal Alignment: On the Generalization of Frozen LLMs to Multimodal Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning. They are the building block for Large Multimodal Models, yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success. In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation aiming to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs.
  Findings. Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations, and complete translation to textual tokens does not exist. Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights. Despite being different, (3) perceptual and textual tokens are implicitly aligned inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize. This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.
  Implications. (1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection. (2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations, revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. (3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost. (4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks.

      <title>Crafting Interpretable Embeddings by Asking LLMs Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved text embeddings for a growing array of natural-language processing tasks. However, their opaqueness and proliferation into scientific domains such as neuroscience have created a growing need for interpretability. Here, we ask whether we can obtain interpretable embeddings through LLM prompting. We introduce question-answering embeddings (QA-Emb), embeddings where each feature represents an answer to a yes/no question asked to an LLM. Training QA-Emb reduces to selecting a set of underlying questions rather than learning model weights.
  We use QA-Emb to flexibly generate interpretable models for predicting fMRI voxel responses to language stimuli. QA-Emb significantly outperforms an established interpretable baseline, and does so while requiring very few questions. This paves the way towards building flexible feature spaces that can concretize and evaluate our understanding of semantic brain representations. We additionally find that QA-Emb can be effectively approximated with an efficient model, and we explore broader applications in simple NLP tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Multi-Task Multi-Modal Models: A Video Generative Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in language foundation models have primarily fueled the recent surge in artificial intelligence. In contrast, generative learning of non-textual modalities, especially videos, significantly trails behind language modeling. This thesis chronicles our endeavor to build multi-task models for generating videos and other modalities under diverse conditions, as well as for understanding and compression applications. Given the high dimensionality of visual data, we pursue concise and accurate latent representations. Our video-native spatial-temporal tokenizers preserve high fidelity. We unveil a novel approach to mapping bidirectionally between visual observation and interpretable lexical terms. Furthermore, our scalable visual token representation proves beneficial across generation, compression, and understanding tasks. This achievement marks the first instances of language models surpassing diffusion models in visual synthesis and a video tokenizer outperforming industry-standard codecs. Within these multi-modal latent spaces, we study the design of multi-task generative models. Our masked multi-task transformer excels at the quality, efficiency, and flexibility of video generation. We enable a frozen language model, trained solely on text, to generate visual content. Finally, we build a scalable generative multi-modal transformer trained from scratch, enabling the generation of videos containing high-fidelity motion with the corresponding audio given diverse conditions. Throughout the course, we have shown the effectiveness of integrating multiple tasks, crafting high-fidelity latent representation, and generating multiple modalities. This work suggests intriguing potential for future exploration in generating non-textual data and enabling real-time, interactive experiences across various media forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel turbulence presents a formidable obstacle for free-space optical (FSO) communication. Anticipation of turbulence levels is highly important for mitigating disruptions. We study the application of machine learning (ML) to FSO data streams to rapidly predict channel turbulence levels with no additional sensing hardware. An optical bit stream was transmitted through a controlled channel in the lab under six distinct turbulence levels, and the efficacy of using ML to classify turbulence levels was examined. ML-based turbulence level classification was found to be &gt;98% accurate with multiple ML training parameters, but highly dependent upon the timescale of changes between turbulence levels.</description>

      <title>The Collusion of Memory and Nonlinearity in Stochastic Approximation With Constant Stepsize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate stochastic approximation (SA) with Markovian data and nonlinear updates under constant stepsize $\alpha&gt;0$. Existing work has primarily focused on either i.i.d. data or linear update rules. We take a new perspective and carefully examine the simultaneous presence of Markovian dependency of data and nonlinear update rules, delineating how the interplay between these two structures leads to complications that are not captured by prior techniques. By leveraging the smoothness and recurrence properties of the SA updates, we develop a fine-grained analysis of the correlation between the SA iterates $\theta_k$ and Markovian data $x_k$. This enables us to overcome the obstacles in existing analysis and establish for the first time the weak convergence of the joint process $(x_k, \theta_k)_{k\geq0}$. Furthermore, we present a precise characterization of the asymptotic bias of the SA iterates, given by $\mathbb{E}[\theta_\infty]-\theta^\ast=\alpha(b_\text{m}+b_\text{n}+b_\text{c})+O(\alpha^{3/2})$. Here, $b_\text{m}$ is associated with the Markovian noise, $b_\text{n}$ is tied to the nonlinearity, and notably, $b_\text{c}$ represents a multiplicative interaction between the Markovian noise and nonlinearity, which is absent in previous works. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive finite-time bounds on higher moment $\mathbb{E}[\|\theta_k-\theta^\ast\|^{2p}]$ and present non-asymptotic geometric convergence rates for the iterates, along with a Central Limit Theorem.</description>

      <title>Faster Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Proximal Sampler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradients have been widely integrated into Langevin-based methods to improve their scalability and efficiency in solving large-scale sampling problems. However, the proximal sampler, which exhibits much faster convergence than Langevin-based algorithms in the deterministic setting Lee et al. (2021), has yet to be explored in its stochastic variants. In this paper, we study the Stochastic Proximal Samplers (SPS) for sampling from non-log-concave distributions. We first establish a general framework for implementing stochastic proximal samplers and establish the convergence theory accordingly. We show that the convergence to the target distribution can be guaranteed as long as the second moment of the algorithm trajectory is bounded and restricted Gaussian oracles can be well approximated. We then provide two implementable variants based on Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), giving rise to SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA. We further show that SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA can achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error in total variation (TV) distance within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient complexities, which outperform the best-known result by at least an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/3})$ factor. This enhancement in performance is corroborated by our empirical studies on synthetic data with various dimensions, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Face recognition is a very important topic in data science and biometric security research areas. It has multiple applications in military, finance, and retail, to name a few. In this paper, the novel hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps will be proposed and combine with the k nearest-neighbor method and/or with the kernel ridge regression method to solve the face recognition problem. Experimental results illustrate that the accuracy of the combination of the novel hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps and one specific classification system is similar to the accuracy of the combination of the old symmetric normalized hypergraph Laplacian Eigenmaps method and one specific classification system.</description>

      <title>Greedy Growing Enables High-Resolution Pixel-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-standing problem of how to learn effective pixel-based image diffusion models at scale, introducing a remarkably simple greedy growing method for stable training of large-scale, high-resolution models. without the needs for cascaded super-resolution components. The key insight stems from careful pre-training of core components, namely, those responsible for text-to-image alignment {\it vs.} high-resolution rendering. We first demonstrate the benefits of scaling a {\it Shallow UNet}, with no down(up)-sampling enc(dec)oder. Scaling its deep core layers is shown to improve alignment, object structure, and composition. Building on this core model, we propose a greedy algorithm that grows the architecture into high-resolution end-to-end models, while preserving the integrity of the pre-trained representation, stabilizing training, and reducing the need for large high-resolution datasets. This enables a single stage model capable of generating high-resolution images without the need of a super-resolution cascade. Our key results rely on public datasets and show that we are able to train non-cascaded models up to 8B parameters with no further regularization schemes. Vermeer, our full pipeline model trained with internal datasets to produce 1024x1024 images, without cascades, is preferred by 44.0% vs. 21.4% human evaluators over SDXL.</description>

      <title>Masked Face Recognition with Generative-to-Discriminative Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked face recognition is important for social good but challenged by diverse occlusions that cause insufficient or inaccurate representations. In this work, we propose a unified deep network to learn generative-to-discriminative representations for facilitating masked face recognition. To this end, we split the network into three modules and learn them on synthetic masked faces in a greedy module-wise pretraining manner. First, we leverage a generative encoder pretrained for face inpainting and finetune it to represent masked faces into category-aware descriptors. Attribute to the generative encoder's ability in recovering context information, the resulting descriptors can provide occlusion-robust representations for masked faces, mitigating the effect of diverse masks. Then, we incorporate a multi-layer convolutional network as a discriminative reformer and learn it to convert the category-aware descriptors into identity-aware vectors, where the learning is effectively supervised by distilling relation knowledge from off-the-shelf face recognition model. In this way, the discriminative reformer together with the generative encoder serves as the pretrained backbone, providing general and discriminative representations towards masked faces. Finally, we cascade one fully-connected layer following by one softmax layer into a feature classifier and finetune it to identify the reformed identity-aware vectors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing masked faces.</description>

      <title>Addressing Discretization-Induced Bias in Demographic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Racial and other demographic imputation is necessary for many applications, especially in auditing disparities and outreach targeting in political campaigns. The canonical approach is to construct continuous predictions -- e.g., based on name and geography -- and then to $\textit{discretize}$ the predictions by selecting the most likely class (argmax). We study how this practice produces $\textit{discretization bias}$. In particular, we show that argmax labeling, as used by a prominent commercial voter file vendor to impute race/ethnicity, results in a substantial under-count of African-American voters, e.g., by 28.2% points in North Carolina. This bias can have substantial implications in downstream tasks that use such labels.
  We then introduce a $\textit{joint optimization}$ approach -- and a tractable $\textit{data-driven thresholding}$ heuristic -- that can eliminate this bias, with negligible individual-level accuracy loss. Finally, we theoretically analyze discretization bias, show that calibrated continuous models are insufficient to eliminate it, and that an approach such as ours is necessary. Broadly, we warn researchers and practitioners against discretizing continuous demographic predictions without considering downstream consequences.</description>

Abstract: The remarkable achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have captivated the attention of both academia and industry, transcending their initial role in dialogue generation. The utilization of LLMs as intermediary agents in various tasks has yielded promising results, sparking a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence. Building on these breakthroughs, we introduce a novel approach that integrates the agent paradigm into the Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, aiming to enhance its robustness and adaptability. Our proposed method, Concept Matching with Agent (CMA), employs neutral prompts as agents to augment the CLIP-based OOD detection process. These agents function as dynamic observers and communication hubs, interacting with both In-distribution (ID) labels and data inputs to form vector triangle relationships. This triangular framework offers a more nuanced approach than the traditional binary relationship, allowing for better separation and identification of ID and OOD inputs. Our extensive experimental results showcase the superior performance of CMA over both zero-shot and training-required methods in a diverse array of real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Balancing User Preferences by Social Networks: A Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model for Mitigating Popularity Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social recommendation models weave social interactions into their design to provide uniquely personalized recommendation results for users. However, social networks not only amplify the popularity bias in recommendation models, resulting in more frequent recommendation of hot items and fewer long-tail items, but also include a substantial amount of redundant information that is essentially meaningless for the model's performance. Existing social recommendation models fail to address the issues of popularity bias and the redundancy of social information, as they directly characterize social influence across the entire social network without making targeted adjustments. In this paper, we propose a Condition-Guided Social Recommendation Model (named CGSoRec) to mitigate the model's popularity bias by denoising the social network and adjusting the weights of user's social preferences. More specifically, CGSoRec first includes a Condition-Guided Social Denoising Model (CSD) to remove redundant social relations in the social network for capturing users' social preferences with items more precisely. Then, CGSoRec calculates users' social preferences based on denoised social network and adjusts the weights in users' social preferences to make them can counteract the popularity bias present in the recommendation model. At last, CGSoRec includes a Condition-Guided Diffusion Recommendation Model (CGD) to introduce the adjusted social preferences as conditions to control the recommendation results for a debiased direction. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is in: https://github.com/hexin5515/CGSoRec.</description>

      <title>TrojFM: Resource-efficient Backdoor Attacks against Very Large Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key challenge in backdoor attacks against large foundation models is the resource limits. Backdoor attacks usually require retraining the target model, which is impractical for very large foundation models. Existing backdoor attacks are mainly designed for supervised classifiers or small foundation models (e.g., BERT). None of these attacks has successfully compromised a very large foundation model, such as Llama-3-70B, especially with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose TrojFM, a novel backdoor attack tailored for very large foundation models. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a novel backdoor injection method. This method forces a backdoored model to generate similar hidden representations for poisoned inputs regardless of their actual semantics. Our approach injects such backdoors by fine-tuning only a very small proportion of model parameters. This enables TrojFM to efficiently launch downstream task-agnostic backdoor attacks against very large foundation models under limited computational resources. Moreover, we optimize the fine-tuning process with our customized QLoRA technique, enabling launching our attack via only~\textit{one A100 GPU}. Furthermore, we design a new trigger injection method to ensure our attack stealthiness. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that TrojFM can launch effective backdoor attacks against widely used large GPT-style models without jeopardizing their normal functionalities (and outperforming existing attacks on BERT-style models). Furthermore, we show that TrojFM is resilient to SOTA defenses and is insensitive to changes in key hyper-parameters. Finally, we conduct a resource analysis to quantify that our method can significantly save computational and memory costs compared to existing backdoor attacks.</description>

      <title>AutoCV: Empowering Reasoning with Automated Process Labeling via Confidence Variation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method named \textbf{Auto}mated Process Labeling via \textbf{C}onfidence \textbf{V}ariation (\textbf{\textsc{AutoCV}}) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by automatically annotating the reasoning steps. Our approach begins by training a verification model on the correctness of final answers, enabling it to generate automatic process annotations. This verification model assigns a confidence score to each reasoning step, indicating the probability of arriving at the correct final answer from that point onward. We detect relative changes in the verification's confidence scores across reasoning steps to automatically annotate the reasoning process. This alleviates the need for numerous manual annotations or the high computational costs associated with model-induced annotation approaches. We experimentally validate that the confidence variations learned by the verification model trained on the final answer correctness can effectively identify errors in the reasoning steps. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the process annotations generated by \textsc{AutoCV} can improve the accuracy of the verification model in selecting the correct answer from multiple outputs generated by LLMs. Notably, we achieve substantial improvements across five datasets in mathematics and commonsense reasoning.

      <title>Structured Graph Network for Constrained Robot Crowd Navigation with Low Fidelity Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies for constrained crowd navigation using a low-fidelity simulator. We introduce a representation of the dynamic environment, separating human and obstacle representations. Humans are represented through detected states, while obstacles are represented as computed point clouds based on maps and robot localization. This representation enables RL policies trained in a low-fidelity simulator to deploy in real world with a reduced sim2real gap. Additionally, we propose a spatio-temporal graph to model the interactions between agents and obstacles. Based on the graph, we use attention mechanisms to capture the robot-human, human-human, and human-obstacle interactions. Our method significantly improves navigation performance in both simulated and real-world environments.

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy in Generative Models via Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the accuracy of generative models and the impact of knowledge transfer on their generation precision. Specifically, we examine a generative model for a target task, fine-tuned using a pre-trained model from a source task. Building on the "Shared Embedding" concept, which bridges the source and target tasks, we introduce a novel framework for transfer learning under distribution metrics such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This framework underscores the importance of leveraging inherent similarities between diverse tasks despite their distinct data distributions. Our theory suggests that the shared structures can augment the generation accuracy for a target task, reliant on the capability of a source model to identify shared structures and effective knowledge transfer from source to target learning. To demonstrate the practical utility of this framework, we explore the theoretical implications for two specific generative models: diffusion and normalizing flows. The results show enhanced performance in both models over their non-transfer counterparts, indicating advancements for diffusion models and providing fresh insights into normalizing flows in transfer and non-transfer settings. These results highlight the significant contribution of knowledge transfer in boosting the generation capabilities of these models.</description>

      <title>UniCompress: Enhancing Multi-Data Medical Image Compression with Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of medical image compression, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) networks have shown remarkable versatility due to their flexible compression ratios, yet they are constrained by a one-to-one fitting approach that results in lengthy encoding times. Our novel method, ``\textbf{UniCompress}'', innovatively extends the compression capabilities of INR by being the first to compress multiple medical data blocks using a single INR network. By employing wavelet transforms and quantization, we introduce a codebook containing frequency domain information as a prior input to the INR network. This enhances the representational power of INR and provides distinctive conditioning for different image blocks. Furthermore, our research introduces a new technique for the knowledge distillation of implicit representations, simplifying complex model knowledge into more manageable formats to improve compression ratios. Extensive testing on CT and electron microscopy (EM) datasets has demonstrated that UniCompress outperforms traditional INR methods and commercial compression solutions like HEVC, especially in complex and high compression scenarios. Notably, compared to existing INR techniques, UniCompress achieves a 4$\sim$5 times increase in compression speed, marking a significant advancement in the field of medical image compression. Codes will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Temporal Spiking Neural Networks with Synaptic Delay for Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are investigated as biologically inspired models of neural computation, distinguished by their computational capability and energy efficiency due to precise spiking times and sparse spikes with event-driven computation. A significant question is how SNNs can emulate human-like graph-based reasoning of concepts and relations, especially leveraging the temporal domain optimally. This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning. It is elucidated that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties via a neural-generalized path formulation. Empirical results highlight the efficacy of temporal delay in relation processing and showcase exemplary performance in diverse graph reasoning tasks. The spiking model is theoretically estimated to achieve $20\times$ energy savings compared to non-spiking counterparts, deepening insights into the capabilities and potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning.

      <title>NCIDiff: Non-covalent Interaction-generative Diffusion Model for Improving Reliability of 3D Molecule Generation Inside Protein Pocket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep generative modeling have changed the paradigm of drug discovery. Among such approaches, target-aware methods that exploit 3D structures of protein pockets were spotlighted for generating ligand molecules with their plausible binding modes. While docking scores superficially assess the quality of generated ligands, closer inspection of the binding structures reveals the inconsistency in local interactions between a pocket and generated ligands. Here, we address the issue by explicitly generating non-covalent interactions (NCIs), which are universal patterns throughout protein-ligand complexes. Our proposed model, NCIDiff, simultaneously denoises NCI types of protein-ligand edges along with a 3D graph of a ligand molecule during the sampling. With the NCI-generating strategy, our model generates ligands with more reliable NCIs, especially outperforming the baseline diffusion-based models. We further adopted inpainting techniques on NCIs to further improve the quality of the generated molecules. Finally, we showcase the applicability of NCIDiff on drug design tasks for real-world settings with specialized objectives by guiding the generation process with desired NCI patterns.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Conformal Isometry Hypothesis for Grid Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conformal isometry hypothesis as a potential explanation for the emergence of hexagonal periodic patterns in the response maps of grid cells. The hypothesis posits that the activities of the population of grid cells form a high-dimensional vector in the neural space, representing the agent's self-position in 2D physical space. As the agent moves in the 2D physical space, the vector rotates in a 2D manifold in the neural space, driven by a recurrent neural network. The conformal isometry hypothesis proposes that this 2D manifold in the neural space is a conformally isometric embedding of the 2D physical space, in the sense that local displacements of the vector in neural space are proportional to local displacements of the agent in the physical space. Thus the 2D manifold forms an internal map of the 2D physical space, equipped with an internal metric. In this paper, we conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis underlies the hexagon periodic patterns of grid cells. We also conduct theoretical analysis to further support this hypothesis. In addition, we propose a conformal modulation of the input velocity of the agent so that the recurrent neural network of grid cells satisfies the conformal isometry hypothesis automatically. To summarize, our work provides numerical and theoretical evidences for the conformal isometry hypothesis for grid cells and may serve as a foundation for further development of normative models of grid cells and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning enhances prediction accuracy on a target distribution by leveraging data from a source distribution, demonstrating significant benefits in various applications. This paper introduces a novel dissimilarity measure that utilizes vicinity information, i.e., the local structure of data points, to analyze the excess error in classification under covariate shift, a transfer learning setting where marginal feature distributions differ but conditional label distributions remain the same. We characterize the excess error using the proposed measure and demonstrate faster or competitive convergence rates compared to previous techniques. Notably, our approach is effective in situations where the non-absolute continuousness assumption, which often appears in real-world applications, holds. Our theoretical analysis bridges the gap between current theoretical findings and empirical observations in transfer learning, particularly in scenarios with significant differences between source and target distributions.</description>

      <title>GTA: Generative Trajectory Augmentation with Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) presents challenges of learning effective decision-making policies from static datasets without any online interactions. Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

      <title>Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large.</description>

      <title>Theories of synaptic memory consolidation and intelligent plasticity for continual learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and animals learn throughout life. Such continual learning is crucial for intelligence. In this chapter, we examine the pivotal role plasticity mechanisms with complex internal synaptic dynamics could play in enabling this ability in neural networks. By surveying theoretical research, we highlight two fundamental enablers for continual learning. First, synaptic plasticity mechanisms must maintain and evolve an internal state over several behaviorally relevant timescales. Second, plasticity algorithms must leverage the internal state to intelligently regulate plasticity at individual synapses to facilitate the seamless integration of new memories while avoiding detrimental interference with existing ones. Our chapter covers successful applications of these principles to deep neural networks and underscores the significance of synaptic metaplasticity in sustaining continual learning capabilities. Finally, we outline avenues for further research to understand the brain's superb continual learning abilities and harness similar mechanisms for artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of SGD with momentum in the nonconvex case: A novel time window-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel time window-based analysis technique to investigate the convergence behavior of the stochastic gradient descent method with momentum (SGDM) in nonconvex settings. Despite its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient descent property and challenges in controlling stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we study the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional analyses. This time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us to establish the first iterate convergence result for SGDM under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. Based on the underlying KL exponent and the utilized step size scheme, we further characterize local convergence rates of SGDM.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Multiscale Reinforcement Q-Learning Algorithms for Mean Field Control Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean Field Control Games (MFCG), introduced in [Angiuli et al., 2022a], represent competitive games between a large number of large collaborative groups of agents in the infinite limit of number and size of groups. In this paper, we prove the convergence of a three-timescale Reinforcement Q-Learning (RL) algorithm to solve MFCG in a model-free approach from the point of view of representative agents. Our analysis uses a Q-table for finite state and action spaces updated at each discrete time-step over an infinite horizon. In [Angiuli et al., 2023], we proved convergence of two-timescale algorithms for MFG and MFC separately highlighting the need to follow multiple population distributions in the MFC case. Here, we integrate this feature for MFCG as well as three rates of update decreasing to zero in the proper ratios. Our technique of proof uses a generalization to three timescales of the two-timescale analysis in [Borkar, 1997]. We give a simple example satisfying the various hypothesis made in the proof of convergence and illustrating the performance of the algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel synthetically generated multi-modal dataset, SCaRL, to enable the training and validation of autonomous driving solutions. Multi-modal datasets are essential to attain the robustness and high accuracy required by autonomous systems in applications such as autonomous driving. As deep learning-based solutions are becoming more prevalent for object detection, classification, and tracking tasks, there is great demand for datasets combining camera, lidar, and radar sensors. Existing real/synthetic datasets for autonomous driving lack synchronized data collection from a complete sensor suite. SCaRL provides synchronized Synthetic data from RGB, semantic/instance, and depth Cameras; Range-Doppler-Azimuth/Elevation maps and raw data from Radar; and 3D point clouds/2D maps of semantic, depth and Doppler data from coherent Lidar. SCaRL is a large dataset based on the CARLA Simulator, which provides data for diverse, dynamic scenarios and traffic conditions. SCaRL is the first dataset to include synthetic synchronized data from coherent Lidar and MIMO radar sensors.

      <title>BWArea Model: Learning World Model, Inverse Dynamics, and Policy for Controllable Language Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed a paradigm shift in natural language processing, yet their limited controllability poses a significant challenge for downstream applications. We aim to address this by drawing inspiration from the neural mechanisms of the human brain, specifically Broca's and Wernicke's areas, which are crucial for language generation and comprehension, respectively. In particular, Broca's area receives cognitive decision signals from Wernicke's area, treating the language generation as an intricate decision-making process, which differs from the fully auto-regressive language generation of existing LLMs. In a similar vein, our proposed system, the BWArea model, conceptualizes language generation as a decision-making task. This model has three components: a language world model, an inverse dynamics model, and a cognitive policy. Like Wernicke's area, the inverse dynamics model is designed to deduce the underlying cognitive intentions, or latent actions, behind each token. The BWArea model is amenable to both pre-training and fine-tuning like existing LLMs. With 30B clean pre-training tokens, we have trained a BWArea model, which achieves competitive performance with LLMs of equal size (1B parameters). Unlike fully auto-regressive LLMs, its pre-training performance does not degenerate if dirty data unintentionally appears. This shows the advantage of a decomposed structure of BWArea model in reducing efforts in laborious data selection and labeling. Finally, we reveal that the BWArea model offers enhanced controllability via fine-tuning the cognitive policy with downstream reward metrics, thereby facilitating alignment with greater simplicity. On 9 out of 10 tasks from two suites, TextWorld and BigBench Hard, our method shows superior performance to auto-regressive LLMs.</description>

Abstract: Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems with access to millions of research papers could inspire new research ideas that may not be conceived by humans alone. However, how interesting are these AI-generated ideas, and how can we improve their quality? Here, we introduce SciMuse, a system that uses an evolving knowledge graph built from more than 58 million scientific papers to generate personalized research ideas via an interface to GPT-4. We conducted a large-scale human evaluation with over 100 research group leaders from the Max Planck Society, who ranked more than 4,000 personalized research ideas based on their level of interest. This evaluation allows us to understand the relationships between scientific interest and the core properties of the knowledge graph. We find that data-efficient machine learning can predict research interest with high precision, allowing us to optimize the interest-level of generated research ideas. This work represents a step towards an artificial scientific muse that could catalyze unforeseen collaborations and suggest interesting avenues for scientists.</description>

Abstract: Humans naturally employ linguistic instructions to convey knowledge, a process that proves significantly more complex for machines, especially within the context of multitask robotic manipulation environments. Natural language, moreover, serves as the primary medium through which humans acquire new knowledge, presenting a potentially intuitive bridge for translating concepts understandable by humans into formats that can be learned by machines. In pursuit of facilitating this integration, we introduce an explainable behavior cloning agent, named Ex-PERACT, specifically designed for manipulation tasks. This agent is distinguished by its hierarchical structure, which incorporates natural language to enhance the learning process. At the top level, the model is tasked with learning a discrete skill code, while at the bottom level, the policy network translates the problem into a voxelized grid and maps the discretized actions to voxel grids. We evaluate our method across eight challenging manipulation tasks utilizing the RLBench benchmark, demonstrating that Ex-PERACT not only achieves competitive policy performance but also effectively bridges the gap between human instructions and machine execution in complex environments.</description>

      <title>WirelessLLM: Empowering Large Language Models Towards Wireless Intelligence</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless technologies and the growing complexity of network infrastructures necessitate a paradigm shift in how communication networks are designed, configured, and managed. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to revolutionize wireless communication systems. However, existing studies on LLMs for wireless systems are limited to a direct application for telecom language understanding. To empower LLMs with knowledge and expertise in the wireless domain, this paper proposes WirelessLLM, a comprehensive framework for adapting and enhancing LLMs to address the unique challenges and requirements of wireless communication networks. We first identify three foundational principles that underpin WirelessLLM: knowledge alignment, knowledge fusion, and knowledge evolution. Then, we investigate the enabling technologies to build WirelessLLM, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, tool usage, multi-modal pre-training, and domain-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, we present three case studies to demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of WirelessLLM for solving typical problems in wireless networks. Finally, we conclude this paper by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning models that excel at analyzing structured data represented as graphs, demonstrating remarkable performance in applications like social network analysis and recommendation systems. However, classical GNNs face scalability challenges when dealing with large-scale graphs. This paper proposes frameworks for implementing GNNs on quantum computers to potentially address the challenges. We devise quantum algorithms corresponding to the three fundamental types of classical GNNs: Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks, and Message-Passing GNNs. A complexity analysis of our quantum implementation of the Simplified Graph Convolutional (SGC) Network shows potential quantum advantages over its classical counterpart, with significant improvements in time and space complexities. Our complexities can have trade-offs between the two: when optimizing for minimal circuit depth, our quantum SGC achieves logarithmic time complexity in the input sizes (albeit at the cost of linear space complexity). When optimizing for minimal qubit usage, the quantum SGC exhibits space complexity logarithmic in the input sizes, offering an exponential reduction compared to classical SGCs, while still maintaining better time complexity. These results suggest our Quantum GNN frameworks could efficiently process large-scale graphs. This work paves the way for implementing more advanced Graph Neural Network models on quantum computers, opening new possibilities in quantum machine learning for analyzing graph-structured data.</description>

      <title>Saturn: Sample-efficient Generative Molecular Design using Memory Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative molecular design for drug discovery has very recently achieved a wave of experimental validation, with language-based backbones being the most common architectures employed. The most important factor for downstream success is whether an in silico oracle is well correlated with the desired end-point. To this end, current methods use cheaper proxy oracles with higher throughput before evaluating the most promising subset with high-fidelity oracles. The ability to directly optimize high-fidelity oracles would greatly enhance generative design and be expected to improve hit rates. However, current models are not efficient enough to consider such a prospect, exemplifying the sample efficiency problem. In this work, we introduce Saturn, which leverages the Augmented Memory algorithm and demonstrates the first application of the Mamba architecture for generative molecular design. We elucidate how experience replay with data augmentation improves sample efficiency and how Mamba synergistically exploits this mechanism. Saturn outperforms 22 models on multi-parameter optimization tasks relevant to drug discovery and may possess sufficient sample efficiency to consider the prospect of directly optimizing high-fidelity oracles.</description>

      <title>Training-free Editioning of Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the software industry's practice of offering different editions or versions of a product tailored to specific user groups or use cases, we propose a novel task, namely, training-free editioning, for text-to-image models. Specifically, we aim to create variations of a base text-to-image model without retraining, enabling the model to cater to the diverse needs of different user groups or to offer distinct features and functionalities. To achieve this, we propose that different editions of a given text-to-image model can be formulated as concept subspaces in the latent space of its text encoder (e.g., CLIP). In such a concept subspace, all points satisfy a specific user need (e.g., generating images of a cat lying on the grass/ground/falling leaves). Technically, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the desired concept subspaces from representative text embedding that correspond to a specific user need or requirement. Projecting the text embedding of a given prompt into these low-dimensional subspaces enables efficient model editioning without retraining. Intuitively, our proposed editioning paradigm enables a service provider to customize the base model into its "cat edition" (or other editions) that restricts image generation to cats, regardless of the user's prompt (e.g., dogs, people, etc.). This introduces a new dimension for product differentiation, targeted functionality, and pricing strategies, unlocking novel business models for text-to-image generators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach and its potential to enable a wide range of customized text-to-image model editions across various domains and applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient mid-term forecasting of hourly electricity load using generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are essential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and energy trading. While numerous models effectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term forecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, besides daily, weekly, and annual seasonal and autoregressive effects, capturing weather and holiday effects, as well as socio-economic non-stationarities in the data, poses significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) built from interpretable P-splines and enhanced with autoregressive post-processing. This model uses smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal (ETS) modeled non-stationary states, a nuanced representation of holiday effects with weekday variations, and seasonal information as input. The proposed model is evaluated on load data from 24 European countries. This analysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers valuable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted load, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead TSO forecasts in fast computation times of a few seconds for several years of hourly data underscores the model's potential for practical application in the power system industry.</description>

      <title>Learning with User-Level Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User-level privacy is important in distributed systems. Previous research primarily focuses on the central model, while the local models have received much less attention. Under the central model, user-level DP is strictly stronger than the item-level one. However, under the local model, the relationship between user-level and item-level LDP becomes more complex, thus the analysis is crucially different. In this paper, we first analyze the mean estimation problem and then apply it to stochastic optimization, classification, and regression. In particular, we propose adaptive strategies to achieve optimal performance at all privacy levels. Moreover, we also obtain information-theoretic lower bounds, which show that the proposed methods are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. Unlike the central DP model, where user-level DP always leads to slower convergence, our result shows that under the local model, the convergence rates are nearly the same between user-level and item-level cases for distributions with bounded support. For heavy-tailed distributions, the user-level rate is even faster than the item-level one.</description>

      <title>Dual feature reduction for the sparse-group lasso and its adaptive variant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sparse-group lasso performs both variable and group selection, making simultaneous use of the strengths of the lasso and group lasso. It has found widespread use in genetics, a field that regularly involves the analysis of high-dimensional data, due to its sparse-group penalty, which allows it to utilize grouping information. However, the sparse-group lasso can be computationally more expensive than both the lasso and group lasso, due to the added shrinkage complexity, and its additional hyper-parameter that needs tuning. In this paper a novel dual feature reduction method, Dual Feature Reduction (DFR), is presented that uses strong screening rules for the sparse-group lasso and the adaptive sparse-group lasso to reduce their input space before optimization. DFR applies two layers of screening and is based on the dual norms of the sparse-group lasso and adaptive sparse-group lasso. Through synthetic and real numerical studies, it is shown that the proposed feature reduction approach is able to drastically reduce the computational cost in many different scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a number of promising uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed to address the prevailing shortcomings of deep neural networks like overconfidence and lack of explainability, quantifying predictive uncertainties in the context of joint semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation has not been explored yet. Since many real-world applications are multi-modal in nature and, hence, have the potential to benefit from multi-task learning, this is a substantial gap in current literature. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to study how multi-task learning influences the quality of uncertainty estimates in comparison to solving both tasks separately.</description>

      <title>Dual VC Dimension Obstructs Sample Compression by Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies embedding of arbitrary VC classes in well-behaved VC classes, focusing particularly on extremal classes. Our main result expresses an impossibility: such embeddings necessarily require a significant increase in dimension. In particular, we prove that for every $d$ there is a class with VC dimension $d$ that cannot be embedded in any extremal class of VC dimension smaller than exponential in $d$.
  In addition to its independent interest, this result has an important implication in learning theory, as it reveals a fundamental limitation of one of the most extensively studied approaches to tackling the long-standing sample compression conjecture. Concretely, the approach proposed by Floyd and Warmuth entails embedding any given VC class into an extremal class of a comparable dimension, and then applying an optimal sample compression scheme for extremal classes. However, our results imply that this strategy would in some cases result in a sample compression scheme at least exponentially larger than what is predicted by the sample compression conjecture.
  The above implications follow from a general result we prove: any extremal class with VC dimension $d$ has dual VC dimension at most $2d+1$. This bound is exponentially smaller than the classical bound $2^{d+1}-1$ of Assouad, which applies to general concept classes (and is known to be unimprovable for some classes). We in fact prove a stronger result, establishing that $2d+1$ upper bounds the dual Radon number of extremal classes. This theorem represents an abstraction of the classical Radon theorem for convex sets, extending its applicability to a wider combinatorial framework, without relying on the specifics of Euclidean convexity. The proof utilizes the topological method and is primarily based on variants of the Topological Radon Theorem.</description>

      <title>Synergy and Diversity in CLIP: Enhancing Performance Through Adaptive Backbone Ensembling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) stands out as a prominent method for image representation learning. Various architectures, from vision transformers (ViTs) to convolutional networks (ResNets) have been trained with CLIP to serve as general solutions to diverse vision tasks. This paper explores the differences across various CLIP-trained vision backbones. Despite using the same data and training objective, we find that these architectures have notably different representations, different classification performance across datasets, and different robustness properties to certain types of image perturbations. Our findings indicate a remarkable possible synergy across backbones by leveraging their respective strengths. In principle, classification accuracy could be improved by over 40 percentage with an informed selection of the optimal backbone per test example.Using this insight, we develop a straightforward yet powerful approach to adaptively ensemble multiple backbones. The approach uses as few as one labeled example per class to tune the adaptive combination of backbones. On a large collection of datasets, the method achieves a remarkable increase in accuracy of up to 39.1% over the best single backbone, well beyond traditional ensembles</description>

      <title>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves, can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2 architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves 3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</description>

      <title>Efficient multi-prompt evaluation of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs' abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry. For example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/prompt-eval.</description>

      <title>A Novel Fusion Architecture for PD Detection Using Semi-Supervised Speech Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to recognize Parkinson's disease (PD) through an English pangram utterance speech collected using a web application from diverse recording settings and environments, including participants' homes. Our dataset includes a global cohort of 1306 participants, including 392 diagnosed with PD. Leveraging the diversity of the dataset, spanning various demographic properties (such as age, sex, and ethnicity), we used deep learning embeddings derived from semi-supervised models such as Wav2Vec 2.0, WavLM, and ImageBind representing the speech dynamics associated with PD. Our novel fusion model for PD classification, which aligns different speech embeddings into a cohesive feature space, demonstrated superior performance over standard concatenation-based fusion models and other baselines (including models built on traditional acoustic features). In a randomized data split configuration, the model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 88.94% and an accuracy of 85.65%. Rigorous statistical analysis confirmed that our model performs equitably across various demographic subgroups in terms of sex, ethnicity, and age, and remains robust regardless of disease duration. Furthermore, our model, when tested on two entirely unseen test datasets collected from clinical settings and from a PD care center, maintained AUROC scores of 82.12% and 78.44%, respectively. This affirms the model's robustness and it's potential to enhance accessibility and health equity in real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) capabilities is becoming increasingly appealing towards building general intelligence. Taking this concept one step further, we draw a parallel to humans and many animals, who inherit primarily learning capabilities but refine their memory and acquire diverse skills and knowledge through extensive lifelong experiences. This parallel inspires our approach to general purpose in-context learning (GPICL). This paper introduces two lightweight but insightful benchmarks specifically crafted to train and evaluate GPICL functionalities. Each benchmark encompasses a wide range of diverse tasks characterized by generation and interaction, minimal transferable knowledge, and long-term dependency. These features present significant challenges for models that primarily rely on context or interactions to enhance their proficiency. We hope that these benchmarks will not only advance research in GPICL but also contribute significantly to the broader field of general intelligence.</description>

      <title>Galaxy: A Resource-Efficient Collaborative Edge AI System for In-situ Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based models have unlocked a plethora of powerful intelligent applications at the edge, such as voice assistant in smart home. Traditional deployment approaches offload the inference workloads to the remote cloud server, which would induce substantial pressure on the backbone network as well as raise users' privacy concerns. To address that, in-situ inference has been recently recognized for edge intelligence, but it still confronts significant challenges stemming from the conflict between intensive workloads and limited on-device computing resources. In this paper, we leverage our observation that many edge environments usually comprise a rich set of accompanying trusted edge devices with idle resources and propose Galaxy, a collaborative edge AI system that breaks the resource walls across heterogeneous edge devices for efficient Transformer inference acceleration. Galaxy introduces a novel hybrid model parallelism to orchestrate collaborative inference, along with a heterogeneity-aware parallelism planning for fully exploiting the resource potential. Furthermore, Galaxy devises a tile-based fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation to mitigate the impact of tensor synchronizations on inference latency under bandwidth-constrained edge environments. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that Galaxy remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under various edge environment setups, achieving up to 2.5x end-to-end latency reduction.</description>

      <title>Transformer In-Context Learning for Categorical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has sought to understand Transformers through the lens of in-context learning with functional data. We extend that line of work with the goal of moving closer to language models, considering categorical outcomes, nonlinear underlying models, and nonlinear attention. The contextual data are of the form $\textsf{C}=(x_1,c_1,\dots,x_N,c_{N})$ where each $c_i\in\{0,\dots,C-1\}$ is drawn from a categorical distribution that depends on covariates $x_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$. Contextual outcomes in the $m$th set of contextual data, $\textsf{C}_m$, are modeled in terms of latent function $f_m(x)\in\textsf{F}$, where $\textsf{F}$ is a functional class with $(C-1)$-dimensional vector output. The probability of observing class $c\in\{0,\dots,C-1\}$ is modeled in terms of the output components of $f_m(x)$ via the softmax. The Transformer parameters may be trained with $M$ contextual examples, $\{\textsf{C}_m\}_{m=1,M}$, and the trained model is then applied to new contextual data $\textsf{C}_{M+1}$ for new $f_{M+1}(x)\in\textsf{F}$. The goal is for the Transformer to constitute the probability of each category $c\in\{0,\dots,C-1\}$ for a new query $x_{N_{M+1}+1}$. We assume each component of $f_m(x)$ resides in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), specifying $\textsf{F}$. Analysis and an extensive set of experiments suggest that on its forward pass the Transformer (with attention defined by the RKHS kernel) implements a form of gradient descent of the underlying function, connected to the latent vector function associated with the softmax. We present what is believed to be the first real-world demonstration of this few-shot-learning methodology, using the ImageNet dataset.</description>

      <title>On the Noise Robustness of In-Context Learning for Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples. Recent works claim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text classification. In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy annotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning. To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the "noisy" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space. Our approach can prevent the selected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up to 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations.</description>

      <title>R-ODE: Ricci Curvature Tells When You Will be Informed</title>

Abstract: Information diffusion prediction is fundamental to understand the structure and organization of the online social networks, and plays a crucial role to blocking rumor spread, influence maximization, political propaganda, etc. So far, most existing solutions primarily predict the next user who will be informed with historical cascades, but ignore an important factor in the diffusion process - the time. Such limitation motivates us to pose the problem of the time-aware personalized information diffusion prediction for the first time, telling the time when the target user will be informed. In this paper, we address this problem from a fresh geometric perspective of Ricci curvature, and propose a novel Ricci-curvature regulated Ordinary Differential Equation (R-ODE). In the diffusion process, R-ODE considers that the inter-correlated users are organized in a dynamic system in the representation space, and the cascades give the observations sampled from the continuous realm. At each infection time, the message diffuses along the largest Ricci curvature, signifying less transportation effort. In the continuous realm, the message triggers users' movement, whose trajectory in the space is parameterized by an ODE with graph neural network. Consequently, R-ODE predicts the infection time of a target user by the movement trajectory learnt from the observations. Extensive experiments evaluate the personalized time prediction ability of R-ODE, and show R-ODE outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Bias of Two-Layer Networks beyond Linearly Separable Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicity bias, the propensity of deep models to over-rely on simple features, has been identified as a potential reason for limited out-of-distribution generalization of neural networks (Shah et al., 2020). Despite the important implications, this phenomenon has been theoretically confirmed and characterized only under strong dataset assumptions, such as linear separability (Lyu et al., 2021). In this work, we characterize simplicity bias for general datasets in the context of two-layer neural networks initialized with small weights and trained with gradient flow. Specifically, we prove that in the early training phases, network features cluster around a few directions that do not depend on the size of the hidden layer. Furthermore, for datasets with an XOR-like pattern, we precisely identify the learned features and demonstrate that simplicity bias intensifies during later training stages. These results indicate that features learned in the middle stages of training may be more useful for OOD transfer. We support this hypothesis with experiments on image data.</description>

      <title>Novel Approaches for ML-Assisted Particle Track Reconstruction and Hit Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track reconstruction is a vital aspect of High-Energy Physics (HEP) and plays a critical role in major experiments. In this study, we delve into unexplored avenues for particle track reconstruction and hit clustering. Firstly, we enhance the algorithmic design effort by utilising a simplified simulator (REDVID) to generate training data that is specifically composed for simplicity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this data in guiding the development of optimal network architectures. Additionally, we investigate the application of image segmentation networks for this task, exploring their potential for accurate track reconstruction. Moreover, we approach the task from a different perspective by treating it as a hit sequence to track sequence translation problem. Specifically, we explore the utilisation of Transformer architectures for tracking purposes. Our preliminary findings are covered in detail. By considering this novel approach, we aim to uncover new insights and potential advancements in track reconstruction. This research sheds light on previously unexplored methods and provides valuable insights for the field of particle track reconstruction and hit clustering in HEP.</description>

      <title>Conditioning on Time is All You Need for Synthetic Survival Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data generation holds considerable promise, offering avenues to enhance privacy, fairness, and data accessibility. Despite the availability of various methods for generating synthetic tabular data, challenges persist, particularly in specialized applications such as survival analysis. One significant obstacle in survival data generation is censoring, which manifests as not knowing the precise timing of observed (target) events for certain instances. Existing methods face difficulties in accurately reproducing the real distribution of event times for both observed (uncensored) events and censored events, i.e., the generated event-time distributions do not accurately match the underlying distributions of the real data. So motivated, we propose a simple paradigm to produce synthetic survival data by generating covariates conditioned on event times (and censoring indicators), thus allowing one to reuse existing conditional generative models for tabular data without significant computational overhead, and without making assumptions about the (usually unknown) generation mechanism underlying censoring. We evaluate this method via extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Our methodology outperforms multiple competitive baselines at generating survival data, while improving the performance of downstream survival models trained on it and tested on real data.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Zeroth-Order Policy Optimization for Meta-Learning of Ergodic Linear Quadratic Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning has been proposed as a promising machine learning topic in recent years, with important applications to image classification, robotics, computer games, and control systems. In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide a convergence result for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We also provide a numerical example to corroborate this perspective.</description>

      <title>BehaviorGPT: Smart Agent Simulation for Autonomous Driving with Next-Patch Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating realistic interactions among traffic agents is crucial for efficiently validating the safety of autonomous driving systems. Existing leading simulators primarily use an encoder-decoder structure to encode the historical trajectories for future simulation. However, such a paradigm complicates the model architecture, and the manual separation of history and future trajectories leads to low data utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Behavior Generative Pre-trained Transformers (BehaviorGPT), a decoder-only, autoregressive architecture designed to simulate the sequential motion of multiple agents. Crucially, our approach discards the traditional separation between "history" and "future," treating each time step as the "current" one, resulting in a simpler, more parameter- and data-efficient design that scales seamlessly with data and computation. Additionally, we introduce the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3), which enables models to reason at the patch level of trajectories and capture long-range spatial-temporal interactions. BehaviorGPT ranks first across several metrics on the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, demonstrating its exceptional performance in multi-agent and agent-map interactions. We outperformed state-of-the-art models with a realism score of 0.741 and improved the minADE metric to 1.540, with an approximately 91.6% reduction in model parameters.</description>

      <title>The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the results of applying deep learning based on hybrid convolutional-recurrent and purely recurrent neural network architectures to the dataset of almost one million complete intersection Calabi-Yau four-folds (CICY4) to machine-learn their four Hodge numbers $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$. In particular, we explored and experimented with twelve different neural network models, nine of which are convolutional-recurrent (CNN-RNN) hybrids with the RNN unit being either GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The remaining four models are purely recurrent neural networks based on LSTM. In terms of the $h^{1,1}, h^{2,1}, h^{3,1}, h^{2,2}$ prediction accuracies, at 72% training ratio, our best performing individual model is CNN-LSTM-400, a hybrid CNN-LSTM with the LSTM hidden size of 400, which obtained 99.74%, 98.07%, 95.19%, 81.01%, our second best performing individual model is LSTM-448, an LSTM-based model with the hidden size of 448, which obtained 99.74%, 97.51%, 94.24%, and 78.63%. These results were improved by forming ensembles of the top two, three or even four models. Our best ensemble, consisting of the top three models, achieved the accuracies of 99.80%, 98.40%, 95.80%, 83.02%. At 80% training ratio, the top two performing models LSTM-448 and LSTM-424 are both LSTM-based with the hidden sizes of 448 and 424. Compared with the 72% training ratio, there is a significant improvement of accuracies, which reached 99.85%, 98.66%, 96.26%, 84.77% for the best individual model and 99.88%, 98.91%, 96.96%, 86.78% for the best ensemble.</description>

      <title>MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data. However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection. To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations. We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements. This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection. Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training. Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin. Our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD.</description>

      <title>Hardness-Aware Scene Synthesis for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D object detection aims to recover the 3D information of concerning objects and serves as the fundamental task of autonomous driving perception. Its performance greatly depends on the scale of labeled training data, yet it is costly to obtain high-quality annotations for point cloud data. While conventional methods focus on generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples as supplements for training, the structural nature of 3D point cloud data facilitates the composition of objects and backgrounds to synthesize realistic scenes. Motivated by this, we propose a hardness-aware scene synthesis (HASS) method to generate adaptive synthetic scenes to improve the generalization of the detection models. We obtain pseudo-labels for unlabeled objects and generate diverse scenes with different compositions of objects and backgrounds. As the scene synthesis is sensitive to the quality of pseudo-labels, we further propose a hardness-aware strategy to reduce the effect of low-quality pseudo-labels and maintain a dynamic pseudo-database to ensure the diversity and quality of synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results on the widely used KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HASS method, which outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods on 3D object detection.

Abstract: Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model with a variety of architectural designs and training procedures to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility. For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last &lt;EOS&gt; token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For model training, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval datasets into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. Combining these techniques, our NV-Embed model, using only publicly available data, has achieved a record-high score of 69.32, ranking No. 1 on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), with 56 tasks, encompassing retrieval, reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity tasks. Notably, our model also attains the highest score of 59.36 on 15 retrieval tasks in the MTEB benchmark (also known as BEIR). We will open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v1.</description>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) such as LLaVA have shown strong performance in visual-linguistic reasoning. These models first embed images into a fixed large number of visual tokens and then feed them into a Large Language Model (LLM). However, this design causes an excessive number of tokens for dense visual scenarios such as high-resolution images and videos, leading to great inefficiency. While token pruning/merging methods do exist, they produce a single length output for each image and do not afford flexibility in trading off information density v.s. efficiency. Inspired by the concept of Matryoshka Dolls, we propose M3: Matryoshka Multimodal Models, which learns to represent visual content as nested sets of visual tokens that capture information across multiple coarse-to-fine granularities. Our approach offers several unique benefits for LMMs: (1) One can explicitly control the visual granularity per test instance during inference, e.g. , adjusting the number of tokens used to represent an image based on the anticipated complexity or simplicity of the content; (2) M3 provides a framework for analyzing the granularity needed for existing datasets, where we find that COCO-style benchmarks only need around ~9 visual tokens to obtain accuracy similar to that of using all 576 tokens; (3) Our approach provides a foundation to explore the best trade-off between performance and visual token length at sample level, where our investigation reveals that a large gap exists between the oracle upper bound and current fixed-scale representations.</description>

Abstract: Neural networks are widespread due to their powerful performance. However, they degrade in the presence of noisy labels at training time. Inspired by the setting of learning with expert advice, where multiplicative weight (MW) updates were recently shown to be robust to moderate data corruptions in expert advice, we propose to use MW for reweighting examples during neural networks optimization. We theoretically establish the convergence of our method when used with gradient descent and prove its advantages in 1d cases. We then validate our findings empirically for the general case by showing that MW improves the accuracy of neural networks in the presence of label noise on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Clothing1M. We also show the impact of our approach on adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>CECILIA: Comprehensive Secure Machine Learning Framework</title>

Abstract: Since ML algorithms have proven their success in many different applications, there is also a big interest in privacy preserving (PP) ML methods for building models on sensitive data. Moreover, the increase in the number of data sources and the high computational power required by those algorithms force individuals to outsource the training and/or the inference of a ML model to the clouds providing such services. To address this, we propose a secure 3-party computation framework, CECILIA, offering PP building blocks to enable complex operations privately. In addition to the adapted and common operations like addition and multiplication, it offers multiplexer, most significant bit and modulus conversion. The first two are novel in terms of methodology and the last one is novel in terms of both functionality and methodology. CECILIA also has two complex novel methods, which are the exact exponential of a public base raised to the power of a secret value and the inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix. We use CECILIA to realize the private inference on pre-trained RKNs, which require more complex operations than most other DNNs, on the structural classification of proteins as the first study ever accomplishing the PP inference on RKNs. In addition to the successful private computation of basic building blocks, the results demonstrate that we perform the exact and fully private exponential computation, which is done by approximation in the literature so far. Moreover, they also show that we compute the exact inverse square root of a secret Gram matrix up to a certain privacy level, which has not been addressed in the literature at all. We also analyze the scalability of CECILIA to various settings on a synthetic dataset. The framework shows a great promise to make other ML algorithms as well as further computations privately computable by the building blocks of the framework.</description>

      <title>Self-Training: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised algorithms aim to learn prediction functions from a small set of labeled observations and a large set of unlabeled observations. Because this framework is relevant in many applications, they have received a lot of interest in both academia and industry. Among the existing techniques, self-training methods have undoubtedly attracted greater attention in recent years. These models are designed to find the decision boundary on low density regions without making additional assumptions about the data distribution, and use the unsigned output score of a learned classifier, or its margin, as an indicator of confidence. The working principle of self-training algorithms is to learn a classifier iteratively by assigning pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training samples with a margin greater than a certain threshold. The pseudo-labeled examples are then used to enrich the labeled training data and to train a new classifier in conjunction with the labeled training set. In this paper, we present self-training methods for binary and multi-class classification; as well as their variants and two related approaches, namely consistency-based approaches and transductive learning. We examine the impact of significant self-training features on various methods, using different general and image classification benchmarks, and we discuss our ideas for future research in self-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first thorough and complete survey on this subject.</description>

      <title>Posterior Probability Matters: Doubly-Adaptive Calibration for Neural Predictions in Online Advertising</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting user response probabilities is vital for ad ranking and bidding. We hope that predictive models can produce accurate probabilistic predictions that reflect true likelihoods. Calibration techniques aim to post-process model predictions to posterior probabilities. Field-level calibration -- which performs calibration w.r.t. to a specific field value -- is fine-grained and more practical. In this paper we propose a doubly-adaptive approach AdaCalib. It learns an isotonic function family to calibrate model predictions with the guidance of posterior statistics, and field-adaptive mechanisms are designed to ensure that the posterior is appropriate for the field value to be calibrated. Experiments verify that AdaCalib achieves significant improvement on calibration performance. It has been deployed online and beats previous approach.</description>

      <title>Policy-based Primal-Dual Methods for Concave CMDP with Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10715v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Concave Constrained Markov Decision Processes (Concave CMDPs) where both the objective and constraints are defined as concave functions of the state-action occupancy measure. We propose the Variance-Reduced Primal-Dual Policy Gradient Algorithm (VR-PDPG), which updates the primal variable via policy gradient ascent and the dual variable via projected sub-gradient descent. Despite the challenges posed by the loss of additivity structure and the nonconcave nature of the problem, we establish the global convergence of VR-PDPG by exploiting a form of hidden concavity. In the exact setting, we prove an $O(T^{-1/3})$ convergence rate for both the average optimality gap and constraint violation, which further improves to $O(T^{-1/2})$ under strong concavity of the objective in the occupancy measure. In the sample-based setting, we demonstrate that VR-PDPG achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity for $\epsilon$-global optimality. Moreover, by incorporating a diminishing pessimistic term into the constraint, we show that VR-PDPG can attain a zero constraint violation without compromising the convergence rate of the optimality gap. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our methods through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Confidence-aware Self-Semantic Distillation on Knowledge Graph Embedding</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE), which projects entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, have garnered significant attention. Although high-dimensional KGE methods offer better performance, they come at the expense of significant computation and memory overheads. Decreasing embedding dimensions significantly deteriorates model performance. While several recent efforts utilize knowledge distillation or non-Euclidean representation learning to augment the effectiveness of low-dimensional KGE, they either necessitate a pre-trained high-dimensional teacher model or involve complex non-Euclidean operations, thereby incurring considerable additional computational costs. To address this, this work proposes Confidence-aware Self-Knowledge Distillation (CSD) that learns from model itself to enhance KGE in a low-dimensional space. Specifically, CSD extracts knowledge from embeddings in previous iterations, which would be utilized to supervise the learning of the model in the next iterations. Moreover, a specific semantic module is developed to filter reliable knowledge by estimating the confidence of previously learned embeddings. This straightforward strategy bypasses the need for time-consuming pre-training of teacher models and can be integrated into various KGE methods to improve their performance. Our comprehensive experiments on six KGE backbones and four datasets underscore the effectiveness of the proposed CSD.</description>

Abstract: Tensor decompositions have proven to be effective in analyzing the structure of multidimensional data. However, most of these methods require a key parameter: the number of desired components. In the case of the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), the ideal value for the number of components is known as the canonical rank and greatly affects the quality of the decomposition results. Existing methods use heuristics or Bayesian methods to estimate this value by repeatedly calculating the CPD, making them extremely computationally expensive. In this work, we propose FRAPPE, the first method to estimate the canonical rank of a tensor without having to compute the CPD. This method is the result of two key ideas. First, it is much cheaper to generate synthetic data with known rank compared to computing the CPD. Second, we can greatly improve the generalization ability and speed of our model by generating synthetic data that matches a given input tensor in terms of size and sparsity. We can then train a specialized single-use regression model on a synthetic set of tensors engineered to match a given input tensor and use that to estimate the canonical rank of the tensor - all without computing the expensive CPD. FRAPPE is over 24 times faster than the best-performing baseline and exhibits a 10% improvement in MAPE on a synthetic dataset. It also performs as well as or better than the baselines on real-world datasets.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the innovative Power Muirhead Mean K-Nearest Neighbors (PMM-KNN) algorithm, a novel data classification approach that combines the K-Nearest Neighbors method with the adaptive Power Muirhead Mean operator. The proposed methodology aims to address the limitations of traditional KNN by leveraging the Power Muirhead Mean for calculating the local means of K-nearest neighbors in each class to the query sample. Extensive experimentation on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of PMM-KNN over other classification methods. Results indicate statistically significant improvements in accuracy on various datasets, particularly those with complex and high-dimensional distributions. The adaptability of the Power Muirhead Mean empowers PMM-KNN to effectively capture underlying data structures, leading to enhanced accuracy and robustness. The findings highlight the potential of PMM-KNN as a powerful and versatile tool for data classification tasks, encouraging further research to explore its application in real-world scenarios and the automation of Power Muirhead Mean parameters to unleash its full potential.</description>

      <title>MAC: A Meta-Learning Approach for Feature Learning and Recombination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization-based meta-learning aims to learn an initialization so that a new unseen task can be learned within a few gradient updates. Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a benchmark algorithm comprising two optimization loops. The inner loop is dedicated to learning a new task and the outer loop leads to meta-initialization. However, ANIL (almost no inner loop) algorithm shows that feature reuse is an alternative to rapid learning in MAML. Thus, the meta-initialization phase makes MAML primed for feature reuse and obviates the need for rapid learning. Contrary to ANIL, we hypothesize that there may be a need to learn new features during meta-testing. A new unseen task from non-similar distribution would necessitate rapid learning in addition reuse and recombination of existing features. In this paper, we invoke the width-depth duality of neural networks, wherein, we increase the width of the network by adding extra computational units (ACU). The ACUs enable the learning of new atomic features in the meta-testing task, and the associated increased width facilitates information propagation in the forwarding pass. The newly learnt features combine with existing features in the last layer for meta-learning. Experimental results show that our proposed MAC method outperformed existing ANIL algorithm for non-similar task distribution by approximately 13% (5-shot task setting)</description>

      <title>Local Model Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Learning and their Uses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of local model reconstruction attacks for federated learning, where a honest-but-curious adversary eavesdrops the messages exchanged between a targeted client and the server, and then reconstructs the local/personalized model of the victim. The local model reconstruction attack allows the adversary to trigger other classical attacks in a more effective way, since the local model only depends on the client's data and can leak more private information than the global model learned by the server. Additionally, we propose a novel model-based attribute inference attack in federated learning leveraging the local model reconstruction attack. We provide an analytical lower-bound for this attribute inference attack. Empirical results using real world datasets confirm that our local reconstruction attack works well for both regression and classification tasks. Moreover, we benchmark our novel attribute inference attack against the state-of-the-art attacks in federated learning. Our attack results in higher reconstruction accuracy especially when the clients' datasets are heterogeneous. Our work provides a new angle for designing powerful and explainable attacks to effectively quantify the privacy risk in FL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11435v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas the ability of deep networks to produce useful predictions has been amply demonstrated, estimating the reliability of these predictions remains challenging. Sampling approaches such as MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles have emerged as the most popular ones for this purpose. Unfortunately, they require many forward passes at inference time, which slows them down. Sampling-free approaches can be faster but suffer from other drawbacks, such as lower reliability of uncertainty estimates, difficulty of use, and limited applicability to different types of tasks and data.
  In this work, we introduce a sampling-free approach that is generic and easy to deploy, while producing reliable uncertainty estimates on par with state-of-the-art methods at a significantly lower computational cost. It is predicated on training the network to produce the same output with and without additional information about it. At inference time, when no prior information is given, we use the network's own prediction as the additional information. We then take the distance between the predictions with and without prior information as our uncertainty measure.
  We demonstrate our approach on several classification and regression tasks. We show that it delivers results on par with those of Ensembles but at a much lower computational cost.</description>

Abstract: Maximization of mutual information between the model's input and output is formally related to "decisiveness" and "fairness" of the softmax predictions, motivating these unsupervised entropy-based criteria for clustering. First, in the context of linear softmax models, we discuss some general properties of entropy-based clustering. Disproving some earlier claims, we point out fundamental differences with K-means. On the other hand, we prove the margin maximizing property for decisiveness establishing a relation to SVM-based clustering. Second, we propose a new self-labeling formulation of entropy clustering for general softmax models. The pseudo-labels are introduced as auxiliary variables "splitting" the fairness and decisiveness. The derived self-labeling loss includes the reverse cross-entropy robust to pseudo-label errors and allows an efficient EM solver for pseudo-labels. Our algorithm improves the state of the art on several standard benchmarks for deep clustering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dealing with distribution shifts is one of the central challenges for modern machine learning. One fundamental situation is the covariate shift, where the input distributions of data change from training to testing stages while the input-conditional output distribution remains unchanged. In this paper, we initiate the study of a more challenging scenario -- continuous covariate shift -- in which the test data appear sequentially, and their distributions can shift continuously. Our goal is to adaptively train the predictor such that its prediction risk accumulated over time can be minimized. Starting with the importance-weighted learning, we show the method works effectively if the time-varying density ratios of test and train inputs can be accurately estimated. However, existing density ratio estimation methods would fail due to data scarcity at each time step. To this end, we propose an online method that can appropriately reuse historical information. Our density ratio estimation method is proven to perform well by enjoying a dynamic regret bound, which finally leads to an excess risk guarantee for the predictor. Empirical results also validate the effectiveness.</description>

EEG signals are taken for epilepsy detection, and with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and machine learning classifier, they perform epilepsy detection. In Epilepsy seizure detection, machine learning classifiers and statistical features are mainly used. The hidden information in the EEG signal helps detect diseases affecting the brain. Sometimes it is complicated to identify the minimum changes in the EEG in the time and frequency domain's purpose. The DWT can give a suitable decomposition of the signals in different frequency bands and feature extraction. We use the tri-dimensionality reduction algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Finally, features are selected by using a fusion rule and at the last step, three different classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) have been used individually for the classification. The proposed framework is tested on the Bonn dataset. The simulation results provide 100% accuracy for the LDA and NB combination outperforming accuracy with other classifiers combinations, including 89.17% for LDA and SVM, 80.42% for LDA and KNN, 89.92% for PCA and NB, 85.58% PCA and SVM, 80.42% PCA and KNN, 82.33% for ICA and NB, 90.42% for ICA and SVM, 90% for ICA and KNN. Also, the LDA and NB combination shows the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Precision, and Recall of 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%. The results prove the effectiveness of this model.</description>

      <title>Protecting Federated Learning from Extreme Model Poisoning Attacks via Multidimensional Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Current defense mechanisms against model poisoning attacks in federated learning (FL) systems have proven effective up to a certain threshold of malicious clients. In this work, we introduce FLANDERS, a novel pre-aggregation filter for FL resilient to large-scale model poisoning attacks, i.e., when malicious clients far exceed legitimate participants. FLANDERS treats the sequence of local models sent by clients in each FL round as a matrix-valued time series. Then, it identifies malicious client updates as outliers in this time series by comparing actual observations with estimates generated by a matrix autoregressive forecasting model maintained by the server. Experiments conducted in several non-iid FL setups show that FLANDERS significantly improves robustness across a wide spectrum of attacks when paired with standard and robust existing aggregation methods.</description>

      <title>Boosting long-term forecasting performance for continuous-time dynamic graph networks via data augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on long-term forecasting (LTF) on continuous-time dynamic graph networks (CTDGNs), which is important for real-world modeling. Existing CTDGNs are effective for modeling temporal graph data due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies but perform poorly on LTF due to the substantial requirement for historical data, which is not practical in most cases. To relieve this problem, a most intuitive way is data augmentation. In this study, we propose \textbf{\underline{U}ncertainty \underline{M}asked \underline{M}ix\underline{U}p (UmmU)}: a plug-and-play module that conducts uncertainty estimation to introduce uncertainty into the embedding of intermediate layer of CTDGNs, and perform masked mixup to further enhance the uncertainty of the embedding to make it generalize to more situations. UmmU can be easily inserted into arbitrary CTDGNs without increasing the number of parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world dynamic graph datasets, the results demonstrate that UmmU can effectively improve the long-term forecasting performance for CTDGNs.</description>

      <title>Learning Personalized Decision Support Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Individual human decision-makers may benefit from different forms of support to improve decision outcomes, but when each form of support will yield better outcomes? In this work, we posit that personalizing access to decision support tools can be an effective mechanism for instantiating the appropriate use of AI assistance. Specifically, we propose the general problem of learning a decision support policy that, for a given input, chooses which form of support to provide to decision-makers for whom we initially have no prior information. We develop $\texttt{Modiste}$, an interactive tool to learn personalized decision support policies. $\texttt{Modiste}$ leverages stochastic contextual bandit techniques to personalize a decision support policy for each decision-maker and supports extensions to the multi-objective setting to account for auxiliary objectives like the cost of support. We find that personalized policies outperform offline policies, and, in the cost-aware setting, reduce the incurred cost with minimal degradation to performance. Our experiments include various realistic forms of support (e.g., expert consensus and predictions from a large language model) on vision and language tasks. Our human subject experiments validate our computational experiments, demonstrating that personalization can yield benefits in practice for real users, who interact with $\texttt{Modiste}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14749v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D geometry and conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. [2010], gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent RNA polymerase ribozyme structure.

      <description>arXiv:2305.15659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning applications have witnessed the remarkable success of optimization algorithms that are designed to find flat minima. Motivated by this design choice, we undertake a formal study that (i) formulates the notion of flat minima, and (ii) studies the complexity of finding them. Specifically, we adopt the trace of the Hessian of the cost function as a measure of flatness, and use it to formally define the notion of approximate flat minima. Under this notion, we then analyze algorithms that find approximate flat minima efficiently. For general cost functions, we discuss a gradient-based algorithm that finds an approximate flat local minimum efficiently. The main component of the algorithm is to use gradients computed from randomly perturbed iterates to estimate a direction that leads to flatter minima. For the setting where the cost function is an empirical risk over training data, we present a faster algorithm that is inspired by a recently proposed practical algorithm called sharpness-aware minimization, supporting its success in practice.</description>

      <title>Think Before You Act: Decision Transformers with Working Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision Transformer-based decision-making agents have shown the ability to generalize across multiple tasks. However, their performance relies on massive data and computation. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the forgetting phenomenon, in which a model memorizes its behaviors in parameters throughout training. As a result, training on a new task may deteriorate the model's performance on previous tasks. In contrast to LLMs' implicit memory mechanism, the human brain utilizes distributed memory storage, which helps manage and organize multiple skills efficiently, mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose a working memory module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks. Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the proposed architecture.</description>

Abstract: Monotonicity constraints are powerful regularizers in statistical modelling. They can support fairness in computer-aided decision making and increase plausibility in data-driven scientific models. The seminal min-max (MM) neural network architecture ensures monotonicity, but often gets stuck in undesired local optima during training because of partial derivatives of the MM nonlinearities being zero. We propose a simple modification of the MM network using strictly-increasing smooth minimum and maximum functions that alleviates this problem. The resulting smooth min-max (SMM) network module inherits the asymptotic approximation properties from the MM architecture. It can be used within larger deep learning systems trained end-to-end. The SMM module is conceptually simple and computationally less demanding than state-of-the-art neural networks for monotonic modelling. Our experiments show that this does not come with a loss in generalization performance compared to alternative neural and non-neural approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning to Stabilize Online Reinforcement Learning in Unbounded State Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, we want policies that reach desired states and then keep the controlled system within an acceptable region around the desired states over an indefinite period of time. This latter objective is called stability and is especially important when the state space is unbounded, such that the states can be arbitrarily far from each other and the agent can drift far away from the desired states. For example, in stochastic queuing networks, where queues of waiting jobs can grow without bound, the desired state is all-zero queue lengths. Here, a stable policy ensures queue lengths are finite while an optimal policy minimizes queue lengths. Since an optimal policy is also stable, one would expect that RL algorithms would implicitly give us stable policies. However, in this work, we find that deep RL algorithms that directly minimize the distance to the desired state during online training often result in unstable policies, i.e., policies that drift far away from the desired state. We attribute this instability to poor credit-assignment for destabilizing actions. We then introduce an approach based on two ideas: 1) a Lyapunov-based cost-shaping technique and 2) state transformations to the unbounded state space. We conduct an empirical study on various queueing networks and traffic signal control problems and find that our approach performs competitively against strong baselines with knowledge of the transition dynamics.

      <title>STG-MTL: Scalable Task Grouping for Multi-Task Learning Using Data Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a powerful technique that has gained popularity due to its performance improvement over traditional Single-Task Learning (STL). However, MTL is often challenging because there is an exponential number of possible task groupings, which can make it difficult to choose the best one because some groupings might produce performance degradation due to negative interference between tasks. That is why existing solutions are severely suffering from scalability issues, limiting any practical application. In our paper, we propose a new data-driven method that addresses these challenges and provides a scalable and modular solution for classification task grouping based on a re-proposed data-driven features, Data Maps, which capture the training dynamics for each classification task during the MTL training. Through a theoretical comparison with other techniques, we manage to show that our approach has the superior scalability. Our experiments show a better performance and verify the method's effectiveness, even on an unprecedented number of tasks (up to 100 tasks on CIFAR100). Being the first to work on such number of tasks, our comparisons on the resulting grouping shows similar grouping to the mentioned in the dataset, CIFAR100. Finally, we provide a modular implementation for easier integration and testing, with examples from multiple datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Safe Policy Learning with Chance Constrained Optimization: Application to Military Security Assessment during the Vietnam War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithmic decisions and recommendations are used in many high-stakes decision-making settings such as criminal justice, medicine, and public policy. We investigate whether it would have been possible to improve a security assessment algorithm employed during the Vietnam War, using outcomes measured immediately after its introduction in late 1969. This empirical application raises several methodological challenges that frequently arise in high-stakes algorithmic decision-making. First, before implementing a new algorithm, it is essential to characterize and control the risk of yielding worse outcomes than the existing algorithm. Second, the existing algorithm is deterministic, and learning a new algorithm requires transparent extrapolation. Third, the existing algorithm involves discrete decision tables that are difficult to optimize over.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Average Conditional Risk (ACRisk), which first quantifies the risk that a new algorithmic policy leads to worse outcomes for subgroups of individual units and then averages this over the distribution of subgroups. We also propose a Bayesian policy learning framework that maximizes the posterior expected value while controlling the posterior expected ACRisk. This framework separates the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from policy optimization, enabling flexible estimation of effects and optimization over complex policy classes. We characterize the resulting chance-constrained optimization problem as a constrained linear programming problem. Our analysis shows that compared to the actual algorithm used during the Vietnam War, the learned algorithm assesses most regions as more secure and emphasizes economic and political factors over military factors.</description>

      <title>From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without significant increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Furthermore, Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40x more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.</description>

Abstract: Graph transformers need strong inductive biases to derive meaningful attention scores. Yet, current methods often fall short in capturing longer ranges, hierarchical structures, or community structures, which are common in various graphs such as molecules, social networks, and citation networks. This paper presents a Hierarchical Distance Structural Encoding (HDSE) method to model node distances in a graph, focusing on its multi-level, hierarchical nature. We introduce a novel framework to seamlessly integrate HDSE into the attention mechanism of existing graph transformers, allowing for simultaneous application with other positional encodings. To apply graph transformers with HDSE to large-scale graphs, we further propose a high-level HDSE that effectively biases the linear transformers towards graph hierarchies. We theoretically prove the superiority of HDSE over shortest path distances in terms of expressivity and generalization. Empirically, we demonstrate that graph transformers with HDSE excel in graph classification, regression on 7 graph-level datasets, and node classification on 11 large-scale graphs, including those with up to a billion nodes.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Explanations for Regression</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often an integral part of modern decision support systems. The best-performing predictive models used in AI-based decision support systems lack transparency. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to create AI systems that can explain their rationale to human users. Local explanations in XAI can provide information about the causes of individual predictions in terms of feature importance. However, a critical drawback of existing local explanation methods is their inability to quantify the uncertainty associated with a feature's importance. This paper introduces an extension of a feature importance explanation method, Calibrated Explanations, previously only supporting classification, with support for standard regression and probabilistic regression, i.e., the probability that the target is above an arbitrary threshold. The extension for regression keeps all the benefits of Calibrated Explanations, such as calibration of the prediction from the underlying model with confidence intervals, uncertainty quantification of feature importance, and allows both factual and counterfactual explanations. Calibrated Explanations for standard regression provides fast, reliable, stable, and robust explanations. Calibrated Explanations for probabilistic regression provides an entirely new way of creating probabilistic explanations from any ordinary regression model, allowing dynamic selection of thresholds. The method is model agnostic with easily understood conditional rules. An implementation in Python is freely available on GitHub and for installation using both pip and conda, making the results in this paper easily replicable.</description>

      <title>Adapting Static Fairness to Sequential Decision-Making: Bias Mitigation Strategies towards Equal Long-term Benefit Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decisions made by machine learning models can have lasting impacts, making long-term fairness a critical consideration. It has been observed that ignoring the long-term effect and directly applying fairness criterion in static settings can actually worsen bias over time. To address biases in sequential decision-making, we introduce a long-term fairness concept named Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT). This concept is seamlessly integrated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to consider the future effects of actions on long-term fairness, thus providing a unified framework for fair sequential decision-making problems. ELBERT effectively addresses the temporal discrimination issues found in previous long-term fairness notions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically simplified to standard policy gradients. This simplification makes conventional policy optimization methods viable for reducing bias, leading to our bias mitigation approach ELBERT-PO. Extensive experiments across various diverse sequential decision-making environments consistently reveal that ELBERT-PO significantly diminishes bias while maintaining high utility.

      <title>PRISM: Leveraging Prototype Patient Representations with Feature-Missing-Aware Calibration for EHR Data Sparsity Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04160v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of patient data; however, the sparsity of EHRs data often presents significant challenges for predictive modeling. Conventional imputation methods inadequately distinguish between real and imputed data, leading to potential inaccuracies of patient representations. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a framework that indirectly imputes data by leveraging prototype representations of similar patients, thus ensuring compact representations that preserve patient information. PRISM also includes a feature confidence learner module, which evaluates the reliability of each feature considering missing statuses. Additionally, PRISM introduces a new patient similarity metric that accounts for feature confidence, avoiding overreliance on imprecise imputed values. Our extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, PhysioNet Challenge 2012, eICU datasets demonstrate PRISM's superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in handling EHR data sparsity. For the sake of reproducibility and further research, we have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/yhzhu99/PRISM.</description>

      <title>DiffAug: Enhance Unsupervised Contrastive Learning with Domain-Knowledge-Free Diffusion-based Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised Contrastive learning has gained prominence in fields such as vision, and biology, leveraging predefined positive/negative samples for representation learning. Data augmentation, categorized into hand-designed and model-based methods, has been identified as a crucial component for enhancing contrastive learning. However, hand-designed methods require human expertise in domain-specific data while sometimes distorting the meaning of the data. In contrast, generative model-based approaches usually require supervised or large-scale external data, which has become a bottleneck constraining model training in many domains. To address the problems presented above, this paper proposes DiffAug, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning technique with diffusion mode-based positive data generation. DiffAug consists of a semantic encoder and a conditional diffusion model; the conditional diffusion model generates new positive samples conditioned on the semantic encoding to serve the training of unsupervised contrast learning. With the help of iterative training of the semantic encoder and diffusion model, DiffAug improves the representation ability in an uninterrupted and unsupervised manner. Experimental evaluations show that DiffAug outperforms hand-designed and SOTA model-based augmentation methods on DNA sequence, visual, and bio-feature datasets. The code for review is released at \url{https://github.com/zangzelin/code_diffaug}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for learning system design with neural feature extractors. First, we introduce the feature geometry, which unifies statistical dependence and feature representations in a function space equipped with inner products. This connection defines function-space concepts on statistical dependence, such as norms, orthogonal projection, and spectral decomposition, exhibiting clear operational meanings. In particular, we associate each learning setting with a dependence component and formulate learning tasks as finding corresponding feature approximations. We propose a nesting technique, which provides systematic algorithm designs for learning the optimal features from data samples with off-the-shelf network architectures and optimizers. We further demonstrate multivariate learning applications, including conditional inference and multimodal learning, where we present the optimal features and reveal their connections to classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Text2Reward: Reward Shaping with Language Models for Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement learning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to high costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a data-free framework that automates the generation and shaping of dense reward functions based on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural language, Text2Reward generates shaped dense reward functions as an executable program grounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and recent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes or unshaped dense rewards with a constant function across timesteps, Text2Reward produces interpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks, utilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback. We evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2, MetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17 manipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve similar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written reward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion behaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the policies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real world. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their reward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at https://text-to-reward.github.io/ .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies in active learning, particularly in uncertainty sampling, have focused on the decomposition of model uncertainty into reducible and irreducible uncertainties. In this paper, the aim is to simplify the computational process while eliminating the dependence on observations. Crucially, the inherent uncertainty in the labels is considered, the uncertainty of the oracles. Two strategies are proposed, sampling by Klir uncertainty, which tackles the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and sampling by evidential epistemic uncertainty, which extends the concept of reducible uncertainty within the evidential framework, both using the theory of belief functions. Experimental results in active learning demonstrate that our proposed method can outperform uncertainty sampling.</description>

      <title>Can Class-Priors Help Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) is a typical weakly supervised multi-label learning problem, where each training example is annotated with only one positive label. Existing SPMLL methods typically assign pseudo-labels to unannotated labels with the assumption that prior probabilities of all classes are identical. However, the class-prior of each category may differ significantly in real-world scenarios, which makes the predictive model not perform as well as expected due to the unrealistic assumption on real-world application. To alleviate this issue, a novel framework named {\proposed}, i.e., Class-pRiors Induced Single-Positive multi-label learning, is proposed. Specifically, a class-priors estimator is introduced, which could estimate the class-priors that are theoretically guaranteed to converge to the ground-truth class-priors. In addition, based on the estimated class-priors, an unbiased risk estimator for classification is derived, and the corresponding risk minimizer could be guaranteed to approximately converge to the optimal risk minimizer on fully supervised data. Experimental results on ten MLL benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing SPMLL approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15293v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots and animals both experience the world through their bodies and senses. Their embodiment constrains their experiences, ensuring they unfold continuously in space and time. As a result, the experiences of embodied agents are intrinsically correlated. Correlations create fundamental challenges for machine learning, as most techniques rely on the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed. In reinforcement learning, where data are directly collected from an agent's sequential experiences, violations of this assumption are often unavoidable. Here, we derive a method that overcomes this issue by exploiting the statistical mechanics of ergodic processes, which we term maximum diffusion reinforcement learning. By decorrelating agent experiences, our approach provably enables single-shot learning in continuous deployments over the course of individual task attempts. Moreover, we prove our approach generalizes well-known maximum entropy techniques, and robustly exceeds state-of-the-art performance across popular benchmarks. Our results at the nexus of physics, learning, and control form a foundation for transparent and reliable decision-making in embodied reinforcement learning agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The susceptibility of modern machine learning classifiers to adversarial examples has motivated theoretical results suggesting that these might be unavoidable. However, these results can be too general to be applicable to natural data distributions. Indeed, humans are quite robust for tasks involving vision. This apparent conflict motivates a deeper dive into the question: Are adversarial examples truly unavoidable? In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that a key property of the data distribution -- concentration on small-volume subsets of the input space -- determines whether a robust classifier exists. We further demonstrate that, for a data distribution concentrated on a union of low-dimensional linear subspaces, utilizing structure in data naturally leads to classifiers that enjoy data-dependent polyhedral robustness guarantees, improving upon methods for provable certification in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Clifford invariants of ADE Coxeter elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in novel Clifford geometric invariants of linear transformations. This motivates the investigation of such invariants for a certain type of geometric transformation of interest in the context of root systems, reflection groups, Lie groups and Lie algebras: the Coxeter transformations. We perform exhaustive calculations of all Coxeter transformations for $A_8$, $D_8$ and $E_8$ for a choice of basis of simple roots and compute their invariants, using high-performance computing. This computational algebra paradigm generates a dataset that can then be mined using techniques from data science such as supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In this paper we focus on neural network classification and principal component analysis. Since the output -- the invariants -- is fully determined by the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of the corresponding reflections in the Coxeter element, we expect huge degeneracy in the mapping. This provides the perfect setup for machine learning, and indeed we see that the datasets can be machine learned to very high accuracy. This paper is a pump-priming study in experimental mathematics using Clifford algebras, showing that such Clifford algebraic datasets are amenable to machine learning, and shedding light on relationships between these novel and other well-known geometric invariants and also giving rise to analytic results.</description>

      <title>Effective Learning with Node Perturbation in Multi-Layer Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) remains the dominant and most successful method for training parameters of deep neural network models. However, BP relies on two computationally distinct phases, does not provide a satisfactory explanation of biological learning, and can be challenging to apply for training of networks with discontinuities or noisy node dynamics. By comparison, node perturbation (NP) proposes learning by the injection of noise into network activations, and subsequent measurement of the induced loss change. NP relies on two forward (inference) passes, does not make use of network derivatives, and has been proposed as a model for learning in biological systems. However, standard NP is highly data inefficient and unstable due to its unguided noise-based search process. In this work, we investigate different formulations of NP and relate it to the concept of directional derivatives as well as combining it with a decorrelating mechanism for layer-wise inputs. We find that a closer alignment with directional derivatives together with input decorrelation at every layer strongly enhances performance of NP learning with large improvements in parameter convergence and much higher performance on the test data, approaching that of BP. Furthermore, our novel formulation allows for application to noisy systems in which the noise process itself is inaccessible.</description>

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) barycenters are a mathematically grounded way of averaging probability distributions while capturing their geometric properties. In short, the barycenter task is to take the average of a collection of probability distributions w.r.t. given OT discrepancies. We propose a novel algorithm for approximating the continuous Entropic OT (EOT) barycenter for arbitrary OT cost functions. Our approach is built upon the dual reformulation of the EOT problem based on weak OT, which has recently gained the attention of the ML community. Beyond its novelty, our method enjoys several advantageous properties: (i) we establish quality bounds for the recovered solution; (ii) this approach seamlessly interconnects with the Energy-Based Models (EBMs) learning procedure enabling the use of well-tuned algorithms for the problem of interest; (iii) it provides an intuitive optimization scheme avoiding min-max, reinforce and other intricate technical tricks. For validation, we consider several low-dimensional scenarios and image-space setups, including non-Euclidean cost functions. Furthermore, we investigate the practical task of learning the barycenter on an image manifold generated by a pretrained generative model, opening up new directions for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn to represent nodes by aggregating information from their neighbors. As GNNs increase in depth, their receptive field grows exponentially, leading to high memory costs. Several existing methods address this by sampling a small subset of nodes, scaling GNNs to much larger graphs. These methods are primarily evaluated on homophilous graphs, where neighboring nodes often share the same label. However, most of these methods rely on static heuristics that may not generalize across different graphs or tasks. We argue that the sampling method should be adaptive, adjusting to the complex structural properties of each graph. To this end, we introduce GRAPES, an adaptive sampling method that learns to identify the set of nodes crucial for training a GNN. GRAPES trains a second GNN to predict node sampling probabilities by optimizing the downstream task objective. We evaluate GRAPES on various node classification benchmarks, involving homophilous as well as heterophilous graphs. We demonstrate GRAPES' effectiveness in accuracy and scalability, particularly in multi-label heterophilous graphs. Unlike other sampling methods, GRAPES maintains high accuracy even with smaller sample sizes and, therefore, can scale to massive graphs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/dfdazac/grapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct an assessment of the optimization capabilities of LLMs across various tasks and data sizes. Each of these tasks corresponds to unique optimization domains, and LLMs are required to execute these tasks with interactive prompting. That is, in each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the past generated solutions with their values, and then the new solutions are evaluated and considered in the next optimization step. Additionally, we introduce three distinct metrics for a comprehensive assessment of task performance from various perspectives. These metrics offer the advantage of being applicable for evaluating LLM performance across a broad spectrum of optimization tasks and are less sensitive to variations in test samples. By applying these metrics, we observe that LLMs exhibit strong optimization capabilities when dealing with small-sized samples. However, their performance is significantly influenced by factors like data size and values, underscoring the importance of further research in the domain of optimization tasks for LLMs.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning: A Cutting-Edge Survey of the Latest Advancements and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust machine learning (ML) models can be developed by leveraging large volumes of data and distributing the computational tasks across numerous devices or servers. Federated learning (FL) is a technique in the realm of ML that facilitates this goal by utilizing cloud infrastructure to enable collaborative model training among a network of decentralized devices. Beyond distributing the computational load, FL targets the resolution of privacy issues and the reduction of communication costs simultaneously. To protect user privacy, FL requires users to send model updates rather than transmitting large quantities of raw and potentially confidential data. Specifically, individuals train ML models locally using their own data and then upload the results in the form of weights and gradients to the cloud for aggregation into the global model. This strategy is also advantageous in environments with limited bandwidth or high communication costs, as it prevents the transmission of large data volumes. With the increasing volume of data and rising privacy concerns, alongside the emergence of large-scale ML models like Large Language Models (LLMs), FL presents itself as a timely and relevant solution. It is therefore essential to review current FL algorithms to guide future research that meets the rapidly evolving ML demands. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the most recent FL algorithms, evaluating them on various fronts including mathematical frameworks, privacy protection, resource allocation, and applications. Beyond summarizing existing FL methods, this survey identifies potential gaps, open areas, and future challenges based on the performance reports and algorithms used in recent studies. This survey enables researchers to readily identify existing limitations in the FL field for further exploration.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, yet their safety and the risk of generating harmful content remain pressing concerns. In this paper, we delve into the potential of In-Context Learning (ICL) to modulate the alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA) which employs harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs, and the In-Context Defense (ICD) which bolsters model resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. We offer theoretical insights to elucidate how a limited set of in-context demonstrations can pivotally influence the safety alignment of LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ICA and ICD in respectively elevating and mitigating the success rates of jailbreaking prompts. Our findings illuminate the profound influence of ICL on LLM behavior, opening new avenues for improving the safety of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Expansion of New Domains within Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study the generalization properties of diffusion models in a few-shot setup, introduce a novel tuning-free paradigm to synthesize the target out-of-domain (OOD) data, and demonstrate its advantages compared to existing methods in data-sparse scenarios with large domain gaps. Specifically, given a pre-trained model and a small set of images that are OOD relative to the model's training distribution, we explore whether the frozen model is able to generalize to this new domain. We begin by revealing that Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained on single-domain images are already equipped with sufficient representation abilities to reconstruct arbitrary images from the inverted latent encoding following bi-directional deterministic diffusion and denoising trajectories. We then demonstrate through both theoretical and empirical perspectives that the OOD images establish Gaussian priors in latent spaces of the given model, and the inverted latent modes are separable from their initial training domain. We then introduce our novel tuning-free paradigm to synthesize new images of the target unseen domain by discovering qualified OOD latent encodings in the inverted noisy spaces. This is fundamentally different from the current paradigm that seeks to modify the denoising trajectory to achieve the same goal by tuning the model parameters. Extensive cross-model and domain experiments show that our proposed method can expand the latent space and generate unseen images via frozen DDPMs without impairing the quality of generation of their original domain. We also showcase a practical application of our proposed heuristic approach in dramatically different domains using astrophysical data, revealing the great potential of such a generalization paradigm in data spare fields such as scientific explorations.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flow over Variational Parameter Space for Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) can be cast as an optimization problem in which the variational parameters are tuned to closely align a variational distribution with the true posterior. The optimization task can be approached through vanilla gradient descent in black-box VI or natural-gradient descent in natural-gradient VI. In this work, we reframe VI as the optimization of an objective that concerns probability distributions defined over a \textit{variational parameter space}. Subsequently, we propose Wasserstein gradient descent for tackling this optimization problem. Notably, the optimization techniques, namely black-box VI and natural-gradient VI, can be reinterpreted as specific instances of the proposed Wasserstein gradient descent. To enhance the efficiency of optimization, we develop practical methods for numerically solving the discrete gradient flows. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset, supplemented by theoretical analyses.</description>

Abstract: We present a highly detectable, trustless watermarking scheme for LLMs: the detection algorithm contains no secret information, and it is executable by anyone. We embed a publicly-verifiable cryptographic signature into LLM output using rejection sampling. We prove that our scheme is cryptographically correct, sound, and distortion-free. We make novel uses of error-correction techniques to overcome periods of low entropy, a barrier for all prior watermarking schemes. We implement our scheme and make empirical measurements over open models in the 2.7B to 70B parameter range. Our experiments suggest that our formal claims are met in practice.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Inference Perspective of Offline RL</title>

Abstract: A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates significantly undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves the most state-of-the-art scores in 9 Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, owing to its tractability, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks (e.g. with action constraints) with minimum algorithmic modifications.</description>

Abstract: We address the challenge of structure learning from multivariate time series that are characterized by a sequence of different, unknown regimes. We introduce a new optimization-based method (CASTOR), that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each regime and determine the number of regimes along with their sequential arrangement. Through the optimization of a score function via an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, CASTOR alternates between learning the regime indices (Expectation step) and inferring causal relationships in each regime (Maximization step). We further prove the identifiability of regimes and DAGs within the CASTOR framework. We conduct extensive experiments and show that our method consistently outperforms causal discovery models across various settings (linear and nonlinear causal relationships) and datasets (synthetic and real data).</description>

      <title>Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: *Relative overgeneralization* (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting to suboptimal behavior of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple, framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem. Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the *Multi-agent MuJoCo* and *Overcooked* benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13 out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop: Towards Label Embeddings for Measuring Classification Difficulty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty in machine learning models is a timely and vast field of research. In supervised learning, uncertainty can already occur in the first stage of the training process, the annotation phase. This scenario is particularly evident when some instances cannot be definitively classified. In other words, there is inevitable ambiguity in the annotation step and hence, not necessarily a "ground truth" associated with each instance. The main idea of this work is to drop the assumption of a ground truth label and instead embed the annotations into a multidimensional space. This embedding is derived from the empirical distribution of annotations in a Bayesian setup, modeled via a Dirichlet-Multinomial framework. We estimate the model parameters and posteriors using a stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm with Markov Chain Monte Carlo steps. The methods developed in this paper readily extend to various situations where multiple annotators independently label instances. To showcase the generality of the proposed approach, we apply our approach to three benchmark datasets for image classification and Natural Language Inference. Besides the embeddings, we can investigate the resulting correlation matrices, which reflect the semantic similarities of the original classes very well for all three exemplary datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Fairness Evaluation via Conditional Value-at-Risk Testing</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models used in prediction and classification tasks may display performance disparities across population groups determined by sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex, age). We consider the problem of evaluating the performance of a fixed ML model across population groups defined by multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., race and sex and age). Here, the sample complexity for estimating the worst-case performance gap across groups (e.g., the largest difference in error rates) increases exponentially with the number of group-denoting sensitive attributes. To address this issue, we propose an approach to test for performance disparities based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). By allowing a small probabilistic slack on the groups over which a model has approximately equal performance, we show that the sample complexity required for discovering performance violations is reduced exponentially to be at most upper bounded by the square root of the number of groups. As a byproduct of our analysis, when the groups are weighted by a specific prior distribution, we show that R\'enyi entropy of order 2/3 of the prior distribution captures the sample complexity of the proposed CVaR test algorithm. Finally, we also show that there exists a non-i.i.d. data collection strategy that results in a sample complexity independent of the number of groups.</description>

      <title>Hacking Task Confounder in Meta-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-learning enables rapid generalization to new tasks by learning knowledge from various tasks. It is intuitively assumed that as the training progresses, a model will acquire richer knowledge, leading to better generalization performance. However, our experiments reveal an unexpected result: there is negative knowledge transfer between tasks, affecting generalization performance. To explain this phenomenon, we conduct Structural Causal Models (SCMs) for causal analysis. Our investigation uncovers the presence of spurious correlations between task-specific causal factors and labels in meta-learning. Furthermore, the confounding factors differ across different batches. We refer to these confounding factors as "Task Confounders". Based on these findings, we propose a plug-and-play Meta-learning Causal Representation Learner (MetaCRL) to eliminate task confounders. It encodes decoupled generating factors from multiple tasks and utilizes an invariant-based bi-level optimization mechanism to ensure their causality for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</description>

      <title>Federated Full-Parameter Tuning of Billion-Sized Language Models with Communication Cost under 18 Kilobytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06353v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) need fine-tuning to improve their responsiveness to natural language instructions. Federated learning offers a way to fine-tune LLMs using the abundant data on end devices without compromising data privacy. Most existing federated fine-tuning methods for LLMs rely on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, which may not reach the performance height possible with full-parameter tuning. However, federated full-parameter tuning of LLMs is a non-trivial problem due to the immense communication cost. This work introduces FedKSeed that employs zeroth-order optimization with a finite set of random seeds. It significantly reduces transmission requirements between the server and clients to just a few random seeds and scalar gradients, amounting to only a few thousand bytes, making federated full-parameter tuning of billion-sized LLMs possible on devices. Building on it, we develop a strategy enabling probability-differentiated seed sampling, prioritizing perturbations with greater impact on model accuracy. Experiments across six scenarios with various LLMs, datasets and data partitions demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing federated LLM fine-tuning methods in both communication efficiency and new task generalization.</description>

      <title>Split-Ensemble: Efficient OOD-aware Ensemble via Task and Model Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, the conventional discriminative deep learning classifiers produce uncalibrated closed-set predictions for OOD data. A more robust classifiers with the uncertainty estimation typically require a potentially unavailable OOD dataset for outlier exposure training, or a considerable amount of additional memory and compute to build ensemble models. In this work, we improve on uncertainty estimation without extra OOD data or additional inference costs using an alternative Split-Ensemble method. Specifically, we propose a novel subtask-splitting ensemble training objective, where a common multiclass classification task is split into several complementary subtasks. Then, each subtask's training data can be considered as OOD to the other subtasks. Diverse submodels can therefore be trained on each subtask with OOD-aware objectives. The subtask-splitting objective enables us to share low-level features across submodels to avoid parameter and computational overheads. In particular, we build a tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture by performing iterative splitting and pruning from a shared backbone model, where each branch serves as a submodel corresponding to a subtask. This leads to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation across submodels under a fixed ensemble computation budget. Empirical study with ResNet-18 backbone shows Split-Ensemble, without additional computation cost, improves accuracy over a single model by 0.8%, 1.8%, and 25.5% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. OOD detection for the same backbone and in-distribution datasets surpasses a single model baseline by, correspondingly, 2.2%, 8.1%, and 29.6% mean AUROC.</description>

Abstract: Score-based generative models (or diffusion models for short) have proven successful for generating text and image data. However, the adaption of this model family to tabular data of mixed-type has fallen short so far. In this paper, we propose CDTD, a Continuous Diffusion model for mixed-type Tabular Data. Specifically, we combine score matching and score interpolation to ensure a common continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical features alike. We counteract the high heterogeneity inherent to data of mixed-type with distinct, adaptive noise schedules per feature or per data type. The learnable noise schedules ensure optimally allocated model capacity and balanced generative capability. We homogenize the data types further with model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes tailored to mixed-type tabular data. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts the sample quality.</description>

Abstract: In the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), recent years have witnessed a significant surge in the application of machine learning (ML). Despite this growth, the field grapples with a lack of unified guidelines and systematic approaches for effectively implementing these ML techniques and comprehensive analysis regarding industrial open-source data across varied scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of machine learning approaches for diagnostics and prognostics of industrial systems using open-source datasets from PHM Data Challenge Competitions held between 2018 and 2023 by PHM Society and IEEE Reliability Society and summarizes a unified ML framework. This review systematically categorizes and scrutinizes the problems, challenges, methodologies, and advancements demonstrated in these competitions, highlighting the evolving role of both conventional machine learning and deep learning in tackling complex industrial tasks related to detection, diagnosis, assessment, and prognosis. Moreover, this paper delves into the common challenges in PHM data challenge competitions by emphasizing both data-related and model-related issues and summarizes the solutions that have been employed to address these challenges. Finally, we identify key themes and potential directions for future research, providing opportunities and prospects for ML further development in PHM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dealing with uncertainty in optimization parameters is an important and longstanding challenge. Typically, uncertain parameters are predicted accurately, and then a deterministic optimization problem is solved. However, the decisions produced by this so-called \emph{predict-then-optimize} procedure can be highly sensitive to uncertain parameters. In this work, we contribute to recent efforts in producing \emph{decision-focused} predictions, i.e., to build predictive models that are constructed with the goal of minimizing a \emph{regret} measure on the decisions taken with them. We begin by formulating the exact expected regret minimization as a pessimistic bilevel optimization model. Then, we establish NP-completeness of this problem, even in a heavily restricted case. Using duality arguments, we reformulate it as a non-convex quadratic optimization problem. Finally, we show various computational techniques to achieve tractability. We report extensive computational results on shortest-path instances with uncertain cost vectors. Our results indicate that our approach can improve training performance over the approach of Elmachtoub and Grigas (2022), a state-of-the-art method for decision-focused learning.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Concept Bottlenecks to Align Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>

Abstract: Goal misalignment, reward sparsity and difficult credit assignment are only a few of the many issues that make it difficult for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn optimal policies. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep neural networks impedes the inclusion of domain experts for inspecting the model and revising suboptimal policies. To this end, we introduce *Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents* (SCoBots), that integrate consecutive concept bottleneck (CB) layers. In contrast to current CB models, SCoBots do not just represent concepts as properties of individual objects, but also as relations between objects which is crucial for many RL tasks. Our experimental results provide evidence of SCoBots' competitive performances, but also of their potential for domain experts to understand and regularize their behavior. Among other things, SCoBots enabled us to identify a previously unknown misalignment problem in the iconic video game, Pong, and resolve it. Overall, SCoBots thus result in more human-aligned RL agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/k4ntz/SCoBots .</description>

      <title>Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models: How to Make Black Boxes Intervenable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, interpretable machine learning has re-explored concept bottleneck models (CBM). An advantage of this model class is the user's ability to intervene on predicted concept values, affecting the downstream output. In this work, we introduce a method to perform such concept-based interventions on pretrained neural networks, which are not interpretable by design, only given a small validation set with concept labels. Furthermore, we formalise the notion of intervenability as a measure of the effectiveness of concept-based interventions and leverage this definition to fine-tune black boxes. Empirically, we explore the intervenability of black-box classifiers on synthetic tabular and natural image benchmarks. We focus on backbone architectures of varying complexity, from simple, fully connected neural nets to Stable Diffusion. We demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning improves intervention effectiveness and often yields better-calibrated predictions. To showcase the practical utility of our techniques, we apply them to deep chest X-ray classifiers and show that fine-tuned black boxes are more intervenable than CBMs. Lastly, we establish that our methods are still effective under vision-language-model-based concept annotations, alleviating the need for a human-annotated validation set.</description>

      <title>Context-Former: Stitching via Latent Conditioned Sequence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn better decision-making compared to behavior policies by stitching the suboptimal trajectories to derive more optimal ones. Meanwhile, Decision Transformer (DT) abstracts the RL as sequence modeling, showcasing competitive performance on offline RL benchmarks. However, recent studies demonstrate that DT lacks of stitching capacity, thus exploiting stitching capability for DT is vital to further improve its performance. In order to endow stitching capability to DT, we abstract trajectory stitching as expert matching and introduce our approach, ContextFormer, which integrates contextual information-based imitation learning (IL) and sequence modeling to stitch sub-optimal trajectory fragments by emulating the representations of a limited number of expert trajectories. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments from two perspectives: 1) We conduct extensive experiments on D4RL benchmarks under the settings of IL, and experimental results demonstrate ContextFormer can achieve competitive performance in multiple IL settings. 2) More importantly, we conduct a comparison of ContextFormer with various competitive DT variants using identical training datasets. The experimental results unveiled ContextFormer's superiority, as it outperformed all other variants, showcasing its remarkable performance.</description>

      <title>SymbolicAI: A framework for logic-based approaches combining generative models and solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce SymbolicAI, a versatile and modular framework employing a logic-based approach to concept learning and flow management in generative processes. SymbolicAI enables the seamless integration of generative models with a diverse range of solvers by treating large language models (LLMs) as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, thus bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. We leverage probabilistic programming principles to tackle complex tasks, and utilize differentiable and classical programming paradigms with their respective strengths. The framework introduces a set of polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for multi-modal data that connects multi-step generative processes and aligns their outputs with user objectives in complex workflows. As a result, we can transition between the capabilities of various foundation models with in-context learning capabilities and specialized, fine-tuned models or solvers proficient in addressing specific problems. Through these operations based on in-context learning our framework enables the creation and evaluation of explainable computational graphs. Finally, we introduce a quality measure and its empirical score for evaluating these computational graphs, and propose a benchmark that compares various state-of-the-art LLMs across a set of complex workflows. We refer to the empirical score as the "Vector Embedding for Relational Trajectory Evaluation through Cross-similarity", or VERTEX score for short. The framework codebase and benchmark are linked below.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Two Points Method for Deep Model Zeroth-order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large foundation models, such as large language models, have performed exceptionally well in various application scenarios. Building or fully fine-tuning such large models is usually prohibitive due to either hardware budget or lack of access to backpropagation. The zeroth-order methods offer a promising direction for tackling this challenge, where only forward passes are needed to update the model. This paper introduces an efficient Stochastic Two-Point (S2P) approach within the gradient-free regime. We present the theoretical convergence properties of S2P under the general and relaxed smoothness assumptions, and the derived results help understand and inherently connect the two popular types of zeroth-order methods, basic random search and stochastic three-point method. The theoretical properties also shed light on a Variant of S2P (VS2P), through exploiting our new convergence properties that better represent the dynamics of deep models in training. Our comprehensive empirical results show that VS2P is highly effective in optimizing objectives for deep models. It outperforms or achieves competitive performance compared to standard methods across various model types and scales.</description>

      <title>Selecting Large Language Model to Fine-tune via Rectified Scaling Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-growing ecosystem of LLMs has posed a challenge in selecting the most appropriate pre-trained model to fine-tune amidst a sea of options. Given constrained resources, fine-tuning all models and making selections afterward is unrealistic. In this work, we formulate this resource-constrained selection task into predicting fine-tuning performance and illustrate its natural connection with Scaling Law. Unlike pre-training, We find that the fine-tuning scaling curve includes not just the well-known "power phase" but also the previously unobserved "pre-power phase". We also explain why existing Scaling Law fails to capture this phase transition phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. To address this, we introduce the concept of "pre-learned data size" into our Rectified Scaling Law, which overcomes theoretical limitations and fits experimental results much better. By leveraging our law, we propose a novel LLM selection algorithm that selects the near-optimal model with hundreds of times less resource consumption, while other methods may provide negatively correlated selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results for learning fast heuristics to solve routing problems. Meanwhile, most of the solvers suffer from generalizing to an unseen distribution or distributions with different scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, called Invariant Nested View Transformer (INViT), which is designed to enforce a nested design together with invariant views inside the encoders to promote the generalizability of the learned solver. It applies a modified policy gradient algorithm enhanced with data augmentations. We demonstrate that the proposed INViT achieves a dominant generalization performance on both TSP and CVRP problems with various distributions and different problem scales.</description>

      <title>Role of Momentum in Smoothing Objective Function in Implicit Graduated Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum has fast convergence and excellent generalizability, a theoretical explanation for this is lacking. In this paper, we show that SGD with momentum smooths the objective function, the degree of which is determined by the learning rate, the batch size, the momentum factor, the variance of the stochastic gradient, and the upper bound of the gradient norm. This theoretical finding reveals why momentum improves generalizability and provides new insights into the role of the hyperparameters, including momentum factor. We also present an implicit graduated optimization algorithm that exploits the smoothing properties of SGD with momentum and provide experimental results supporting our assertion that SGD with momentum smooths the objective function.</description>

      <title>Variational DAG Estimation via State Augmentation With Stochastic Permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the structure of a Bayesian network, in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), from observational data is a statistically and computationally hard problem with essential applications in areas such as causal discovery. Bayesian approaches are a promising direction for solving this task, as they allow for uncertainty quantification and deal with well-known identifiability issues. From a probabilistic inference perspective, the main challenges are (i) representing distributions over graphs that satisfy the DAG constraint and (ii) estimating a posterior over the underlying combinatorial space. We propose an approach that addresses these challenges by formulating a joint distribution on an augmented space of DAGs and permutations. We carry out posterior estimation via variational inference, where we exploit continuous relaxations of discrete distributions. We show that our approach performs competitively when compared with a wide range of Bayesian and non-Bayesian benchmarks on a range of synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based hyperparameter optimization methods update hyperparameters using hypergradients, gradients of a meta criterion with respect to hyperparameters. Previous research used two distinct update strategies: optimizing hyperparameters using global hypergradients obtained after completing model training or local hypergradients derived after every few model updates. While global hypergradients offer reliability, their computational cost is significant; conversely, local hypergradients provide speed but are often suboptimal. In this paper, we propose *glocal* hypergradient estimation, blending "global" quality with "local" efficiency. To this end, we use the Koopman operator theory to linearize the dynamics of hypergradients so that the global hypergradients can be efficiently approximated only by using a trajectory of local hypergradients. Consequently, we can optimize hyperparameters greedily using estimated global hypergradients, achieving both reliability and efficiency simultaneously. Through numerical experiments of hyperparameter optimization, including optimization of optimizers, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the glocal hypergradient estimation.</description>

Abstract: Whether embedding spaces use all their dimensions equally, i.e., whether they are isotropic, has been a recent subject of discussion. Evidence has been accrued both for and against enforcing isotropy in embedding spaces. In the present paper, we stress that isotropy imposes requirements on the embedding space that are not compatible with the presence of clusters -- which also negatively impacts linear classification objectives. We demonstrate this fact both mathematically and empirically and use it to shed light on previous results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Guidance with Spherical Gaussian Constraint for Conditional Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models attempt to handle conditional generative tasks by utilizing a differentiable loss function for guidance without the need for additional training. While these methods achieved certain success, they often compromise on sample quality and require small guidance step sizes, leading to longer sampling processes. This paper reveals that the fundamental issue lies in the manifold deviation during the sampling process when loss guidance is employed. We theoretically show the existence of manifold deviation by establishing a certain lower bound for the estimation error of the loss guidance. To mitigate this problem, we propose Diffusion with Spherical Gaussian constraint (DSG), drawing inspiration from the concentration phenomenon in high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. DSG effectively constrains the guidance step within the intermediate data manifold through optimization and enables the use of larger guidance steps. Furthermore, we present a closed-form solution for DSG denoising with the Spherical Gaussian constraint. Notably, DSG can seamlessly integrate as a plugin module within existing training-free conditional diffusion methods. Implementing DSG merely involves a few lines of additional code with almost no extra computational overhead, yet it leads to significant performance improvements. Comprehensive experimental results in various conditional generation tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of DSG in terms of both sample quality and time efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Reward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is commonly assumed that an immediate reward signal is generated for each action taken by the agent, helping the agent maximize cumulative rewards to obtain the optimal policy. However, in many real-world scenarios, immediate reward signals are not obtainable; instead, agents receive a single reward that is contingent upon a partial sequence or a complete trajectory. In this work, we define this challenging problem as Reinforcement Learning from Bagged Reward (RLBR), where sequences of data are treated as bags with non-Markovian bagged rewards. We provide a theoretical study to establish the connection between RLBR and standard RL in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). To effectively explore the reward distributions within these bags and enhance policy training, we propose a Transformer-based reward model, the Reward Bag Transformer, which employs a bidirectional attention mechanism to interpret contextual nuances and temporal dependencies within each bag. Our empirical evaluations reveal that the challenge intensifies as the bag length increases, leading to the performance degradation due to reduced informational granularity. Nevertheless, our approach consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating the least decline in efficacy across varying bag lengths and excelling in approximating the original MDP's reward distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches in offline reinforcement learning aim to learn the optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward, also known as return. However, as applications broaden, it becomes increasingly crucial to train agents that not only maximize the returns, but align the actual return with a specified target return, giving control over the agent's performance. Decision Transformer (DT) optimizes a policy that generates actions conditioned on the target return through supervised learning and is equipped with a mechanism to control the agent using the target return. However, the action generation is hardly influenced by the target return because DT's self-attention allocates scarce attention scores to the return tokens. In this paper, we propose Return-Aligned Decision Transformer (RADT), designed to effectively align the actual return with the target return. RADT utilizes features extracted by paying attention solely to the return, enabling the action generation to consistently depend on the target return. Extensive experiments show that RADT reduces the discrepancies between the actual return and the target return of DT-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the computational limits of the memory retrieval dynamics of modern Hopfield models from the fine-grained complexity analysis. Our key contribution is the characterization of a phase transition behavior in the efficiency of all possible modern Hopfield models based on the norm of patterns. Specifically, we establish an upper bound criterion for the norm of input query patterns and memory patterns. Only below this criterion, sub-quadratic (efficient) variants of the modern Hopfield model exist, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). To showcase our theory, we provide a formal example of efficient constructions of modern Hopfield models using low-rank approximation when the efficient criterion holds. This includes a derivation of a lower bound on the computational time, scaling linearly with $\max\{$\# of stored memory patterns, length of input query sequence$\}$. In addition, we prove its memory retrieval error bound and exponential memory capacity.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of training diffusion models to sample from a distribution with a given unnormalized density or energy function. We benchmark several diffusion-structured inference methods, including simulation-based variational approaches and off-policy methods (continuous generative flow networks). Our results shed light on the relative advantages of existing algorithms while bringing into question some claims from past work. We also propose a novel exploration strategy for off-policy methods, based on local search in the target space with the use of a replay buffer, and show that it improves the quality of samples on a variety of target distributions. Our code for the sampling methods and benchmarks studied is made public at https://github.com/GFNOrg/gfn-diffusion as a base for future work on diffusion models for amortized inference.</description>

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade and even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1) statistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized parameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2) finetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks (e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.

      <title>Loss Landscape of Shallow ReLU-like Neural Networks: Stationary Points, Saddle Escaping, and Network Embedding</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer neural networks with ReLU-like activation functions trained with the empirical squared loss. As the activation function is non-differentiable, it is so far unclear how to completely characterize the stationary points. We propose the conditions for stationarity that apply to both non-differentiable and differentiable cases. Additionally, we show that, if a stationary point does not contain "escape neurons", which are defined with first-order conditions, then it must be a local minimum. Moreover, for the scalar-output case, the presence of an escape neuron guarantees that the stationary point is not a local minimum. Our results refine the description of the saddle-to-saddle training process starting from infinitesimally small (vanishing) initialization for shallow ReLU-like networks, linking saddle escaping directly with the parameter changes of escape neurons. Moreover, we are also able to fully discuss how network embedding, which is to instantiate a narrower network within a wider network, reshapes the stationary points.</description>

      <title>Improving Token-Based World Models with Parallel Observation Prediction</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However, during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization, and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet) with a novel forward mode tailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a 15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12 hours. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/leor-c/REM}.</description>

      <title>Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning to Compose Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks. On both training LLaMA models from scratch and prompting on GPT-4 and Gemini, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models.</description>

      <title>For Better or For Worse? Learning Minimum Variance Features With Label Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation has been pivotal in successfully training deep learning models on classification tasks over the past decade. An important subclass of data augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup - involves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during model training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label augmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on binary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the minimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes weight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to show that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label smoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output variance. An important consequence of our results is negative: label smoothing and Mixup can be less robust to spurious correlations in the data. We verify that our theory reflects practice via experiments on image classification benchmarks modified to have spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>HyperBERT: Mixing Hypergraph-Aware Layers with Language Models for Node Classification on Text-Attributed Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are characterized by complex topological structure, representing higher-order interactions among multiple entities through hyperedges. Lately, hypergraph-based deep learning methods to learn informative data representations for the problem of node classification on text-attributed hypergraphs have garnered increasing research attention. However, existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture the full extent of hypergraph structural information and the rich linguistic attributes inherent in the nodes attributes, which largely hampers their effectiveness and generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we explore ways to further augment a pretrained BERT model with specialized hypergraph-aware layers for the task of node classification. Such layers introduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thus improving the model's capacity to harness both higher-order context information from the hypergraph structure and semantic information present in text. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, HyperBERT, a mixed text-hypergraph model which simultaneously models hypergraph relational structure while maintaining the high-quality text encoding capabilities of a pre-trained BERT. Notably, HyperBERT presents results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on five challenging text-attributed hypergraph node classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the Distance from Calibration in Sequential Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sequential binary prediction setting where the forecaster is evaluated in terms of the calibration distance, which is defined as the $L_1$ distance between the predicted values and the set of predictions that are perfectly calibrated in hindsight. This is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by B{\l}asiok, Gopalan, Hu and Nakkiran (STOC 2023) for the offline setting. The calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a Lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $L_1$ calibration error and its variants.
  We prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $T$ binary outcomes. At the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. We then show that an $O(\sqrt{T})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a Lipschitz class.
  On the lower bound side, an $\Omega(T^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). Interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(T)$.</description>

      <title>G-Retriever: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Textual Graph Understanding and Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph. While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs. In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop a Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever method, introducing the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for general textual graphs, which can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and mitigates hallucination.~\footnote{Our codes and datasets are available at: \url{https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever}}</description>

      <title>Avoiding Catastrophe in Continuous Spaces by Asking for Help</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume all mistakes are reversible and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors. This approach leads to poor outcomes when some mistakes are irreparable or even catastrophic. We propose a variant of the contextual bandit problem where the goal is to minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe that round, and try to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe). We allow a limited number of queries to a mentor and assume a Lipschitz continuous payoff function. We first show that in general, any algorithm either constantly queries the mentor or is nearly guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, when the mentor policy class has bounded Natarajan dimension and contains at least some "reasonable" policies, we provide an algorithm whose regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon grows. We also present an alternative algorithm which provides the same regret and query guarantees when the mentor's action changes a constant number of times in a 1D state space, and can handle adversarially chosen states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical studies have identified a range of learnability biases and limitations of transformers, such as a persistent difficulty in learning to compute simple formal languages such as PARITY, and a bias towards low-degree functions. However, theoretical understanding remains limited, with existing expressiveness theory either overpredicting or underpredicting realistic learning abilities. We prove that, under the transformer architecture, the loss landscape is constrained by the input-space sensitivity: Transformers whose output is sensitive to many parts of the input string inhabit isolated points in parameter space, leading to a low-sensitivity bias in generalization. We show theoretically and empirically that this theory unifies a broad array of empirical observations about the learning abilities and biases of transformers, such as their generalization bias towards low sensitivity and low degree, and difficulty in length generalization for PARITY. This shows that understanding transformers' inductive biases requires studying not just their in-principle expressivity, but also their loss landscape.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for image generation. However, sampling from diffusion models is usually time-consuming due to the inherent autoregressive nature of their sampling process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that accelerates the sampling of diffusion models by parallelizing the autoregressive process. Specifically, we reformulate the sampling process as solving a system of triangular nonlinear equations through fixed-point iteration. With this innovative formulation, we explore several systematic techniques to further reduce the iteration steps required by the solving process. Applying these techniques, we introduce ParaTAA, a universal and training-free parallel sampling algorithm that can leverage extra computational and memory resources to increase the sampling speed. Our experiments demonstrate that ParaTAA can decrease the inference steps required by common sequential sampling algorithms such as DDIM and DDPM by a factor of 4$\sim$14 times. Notably, when applying ParaTAA with 100 steps DDIM for Stable Diffusion, a widely-used text-to-image diffusion model, it can produce the same images as the sequential sampling in only 7 inference steps. The code is available at https://github.com/TZW1998/ParaTAA-Diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in visualizing deep neural networks provide insights into their structures and mesh extraction from Continuous Piecewise Affine (CPWA) functions. Meanwhile, developments in neural surface representation learning incorporate non-linear positional encoding, addressing issues like spectral bias; however, this poses challenges in applying mesh extraction techniques based on CPWA functions. Focusing on trilinear interpolating methods as positional encoding, we present theoretical insights and an analytical mesh extraction, showing the transformation of hypersurfaces to flat planes within the trilinear region under the eikonal constraint. Moreover, we introduce a method for approximating intersecting points among three hypersurfaces contributing to broader applications. We empirically validate correctness and parsimony through chamfer distance and efficiency, and angular distance, while examining the correlation between the eikonal loss and the planarity of the hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>AdAdaGrad: Adaptive Batch Size Schemes for Adaptive Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The choice of batch sizes in minibatch stochastic gradient optimizers is critical in large-scale model training for both optimization and generalization performance. Although large-batch training is arguably the dominant training paradigm for large-scale deep learning due to hardware advances, the generalization performance of the model deteriorates compared to small-batch training, leading to the so-called "generalization gap" phenomenon. To mitigate this, we investigate adaptive batch size strategies derived from adaptive sampling methods, originally developed only for stochastic gradient descent. Given the significant interplay between learning rates and batch sizes, and considering the prevalence of adaptive gradient methods in deep learning, we emphasize the need for adaptive batch size strategies in these contexts. We introduce AdAdaGrad and its scalar variant AdAdaGradNorm, which progressively increase batch sizes during training, while model updates are performed using AdaGrad and AdaGradNorm. We prove that AdAdaGradNorm converges with high probability at a rate of $\mathscr{O}(1/K)$ to find a first-order stationary point of smooth nonconvex functions within $K$ iterations. AdAdaGrad also demonstrates similar convergence properties when integrated with a novel coordinate-wise variant of our adaptive batch size strategies. We corroborate our theoretical claims by performing image classification experiments, highlighting the merits of the proposed schemes in terms of both training efficiency and model generalization. Our work unveils the potential of adaptive batch size strategies for adaptive gradient optimizers in large-scale model training.</description>

Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</description>

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become the standard approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLM), but our theoretical understanding of LoRA has been limited. In this work, we theoretically analyze LoRA fine-tuning in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime with $N$ data points, showing: (i) full fine-tuning (without LoRA) admits a low-rank solution of rank $r\lesssim \sqrt{N}$; (ii) using LoRA with rank $r\gtrsim \sqrt{N}$ eliminates spurious local minima, allowing gradient descent to find the low-rank solutions; (iii) the low-rank solution found using LoRA generalizes well.</description>

      <title>ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity within Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Offline Policy Learning: Tutorial, Survey, and Perspectives on Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Deep generative models (DGMs) have demonstrated great success across various domains, particularly in generating texts, images, and videos using models trained from offline data. Similarly, data-driven decision-making and robotic control also necessitate learning a generator function from the offline data to serve as the strategy or policy. In this case, applying deep generative models in offline policy learning exhibits great potential, and numerous studies have explored in this direction. However, this field still lacks a comprehensive review and so developments of different branches are relatively independent. In this paper, we provide the first systematic review on the applications of deep generative models for offline policy learning. In particular, we cover five mainstream deep generative models, including Variational Auto-Encoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Normalizing Flows, Transformers, and Diffusion Models, and their applications in both offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) and imitation learning (IL). Offline RL and IL are two main branches of offline policy learning and are widely-adopted techniques for sequential decision-making. Notably, for each type of DGM-based offline policy learning, we distill its fundamental scheme, categorize related works based on the usage of the DGM, and sort out the development process of algorithms in that field. Subsequent to the main content, we provide in-depth discussions on deep generative models and offline policy learning as a summary, based on which we present our perspectives on future research directions. This work offers a hands-on reference for the research progress in deep generative models for offline policy learning, and aims to inspire improved DGM-based offline RL or IL algorithms. For convenience, we maintain a paper list on https://github.com/LucasCJYSDL/DGMs-for-Offline-Policy-Learning.</description>

Abstract: Geometry is a ubiquitous language of computer graphics, design, and engineering. However, the lack of large shape datasets limits the application of state-of-the-art supervised learning methods and motivates the exploration of alternative learning strategies. To this end, we introduce geometry-informed neural networks (GINNs) to train shape generative models \emph{without any data}. GINNs combine (i) learning under constraints, (ii) neural fields as a suitable representation, and (iii) generating diverse solutions to under-determined problems. We apply GINNs to several two and three-dimensional problems of increasing levels of complexity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of training shape generative models in a data-free setting. This new paradigm opens several exciting research directions, expanding the application of generative models into domains where data is sparse.</description>

      <title>Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in large language models are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair.</description>

      <title>Foundation Policies with Hilbert Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised and self-supervised objectives, such as next token prediction, have enabled pre-training generalist models from large amounts of unlabeled data. In reinforcement learning (RL), however, finding a truly general and scalable unsupervised pre-training objective for generalist policies from offline data remains a major open question. While a number of methods have been proposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as goal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such methods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered behaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our key insight is to learn a structured representation that preserves the temporal structure of the underlying environment, and then to span this learned latent space with directional movements, which enables various zero-shot policy "prompting" schemes for downstream tasks. Through our experiments on simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, we show that our unsupervised policies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL tasks in a zero-shot fashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed specifically for each setting. Our code and videos are available at https://seohong.me/projects/hilp/.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Selective Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Should prediction models always deliver a prediction? In the pursuit of maximum predictive performance, critical considerations of reliability and fairness are often overshadowed, particularly when it comes to the role of uncertainty. Selective regression, also known as the "reject option," allows models to abstain from predictions in cases of considerable uncertainty. Initially proposed seven decades ago, approaches to selective regression have mostly focused on distribution-based proxies for measuring uncertainty, particularly conditional variance. However, this focus neglects the significant influence of model-specific biases on a model's performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to selective regression by leveraging conformal prediction, which provides grounded confidence measures for individual predictions based on model-specific biases. In addition, we propose a standardized evaluation framework to allow proper comparison of selective regression approaches. Via an extensive experimental approach, we demonstrate how our proposed approach, conformalized selective regression, demonstrates an advantage over multiple state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

Abstract: We present an algorithm for skill discovery from expert demonstrations. The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process. Our results demonstrate that agents equipped with our method are able to discover skills that help accelerate learning and outperform baseline skill learning approaches on new long-horizon tasks in BabyAI, a grid world navigation environment, as well as ALFRED, a household simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Why Transformers Need Adam: A Hessian Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SGD performs worse than Adam by a significant margin on Transformers, but the reason remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation of SGD's bad performance on Transformers through the lens of Hessian: (i) Transformers are "heterogeneous": the Hessian spectrum across parameter blocks vary dramatically, a phenomenon we call "block heterogeneity"; (ii) Heterogeneity hampers SGD: SGD performs badly on problems with block heterogeneity. To validate that heterogeneity hampers SGD, we check various Transformers, CNNs, MLPs, and quadratic problems, and find that SGD works well on problems without block heterogeneity but performs badly when the heterogeneity exists. Our initial theoretical analysis indicates that SGD performs poorly because it applies one single learning rate to all blocks, which cannot handle the heterogeneity among blocks. This limitation could be ameliorated if we use coordinate-wise learning rates, as designed in Adam.</description>

      <title>PRoLoRA: Partial Rotation Empowers More Parameter-Efficient LoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs), serving numerous low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) concurrently has become increasingly impractical, leading to unaffordable costs and necessitating more parameter-efficient finetuning methods. In this work, we introduce Partially Rotation-enhanced Low-Rank Adaptation (PRoLoRA), an intra-layer sharing mechanism comprising four essential components: broadcast reduction, rotation enhancement, partially-sharing refinement, and rectified initialization strategy. As a superset of LoRA, PRoLoRA retains its advantages, and effectively circumvent the drawbacks of peer parameter-sharing methods with superior model capacity, practical feasibility, and broad applicability. Empirical experiments demonstrate the remarkably higher parameter efficiency of PRoLoRA in both specific parameter budget and performance target scenarios, and its scalability to larger LLMs. Notably, with one time less trainable parameters, PRoLoRA still outperforms LoRA on multiple instruction tuning datasets. Subsequently, an ablation study is conducted to validate the necessity of individual components and highlight the superiority of PRoLoRA over three potential variants. Hopefully, the conspicuously higher parameter efficiency can establish PRoLoRA as a resource-friendly alternative to LoRA.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare is typically concerned with narrow self-contained tasks such as sepsis prediction or anesthesia control. However, previous research has demonstrated the potential of generalist models (the prime example being Large Language Models) to outperform task-specific approaches due to their capability for implicit transfer learning. To enable training of foundation models for Healthcare as well as leverage the capabilities of state of the art Transformer architectures, we propose the paradigm of Healthcare as Sequence Modeling, in which interaction between the patient and the healthcare provider is represented as an event stream and tasks like diagnosis and treatment selection are modeled as prediction of future events in the stream. To explore this paradigm experimentally we develop MIMIC-SEQ, a sequence modeling benchmark derived by translating heterogenous clinical records from MIMIC-IV dataset into a uniform event stream format, train a baseline model and explore its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Critical windows: non-asymptotic theory for feature emergence in diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop theory to understand an intriguing property of diffusion models for image generation that we term critical windows. Empirically, it has been observed that there are narrow time intervals in sampling during which particular features of the final image emerge, e.g. the image class or background color (Ho et al., 2020b; Meng et al., 2022; Choi et al., 2022; Raya &amp; Ambrogioni, 2023; Georgiev et al., 2023; Sclocchi et al., 2024; Biroli et al., 2024). While this is advantageous for interpretability as it implies one can localize properties of the generation to a small segment of the trajectory, it seems at odds with the continuous nature of the diffusion. We propose a formal framework for studying these windows and show that for data coming from a mixture of strongly log-concave densities, these windows can be provably bounded in terms of certain measures of inter- and intra-group separation. We also instantiate these bounds for concrete examples like well-conditioned Gaussian mixtures. Finally, we use our bounds to give a rigorous interpretation of diffusion models as hierarchical samplers that progressively "decide" output features over a discrete sequence of times. We validate our bounds with synthetic experiments. Additionally, preliminary experiments on Stable Diffusion suggest critical windows may serve as a useful tool for diagnosing fairness and privacy violations in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Iterated $Q$-Network: Beyond One-Step Bellman Updates in Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning methods is largely impacted by the computation effort and data requirements needed to obtain effective estimates of action-value functions, which in turn determine the quality of the overall performance and the sample-efficiency of the learning procedure. Typically, action-value functions are estimated through an iterative scheme that alternates the application of an empirical approximation of the Bellman operator and a subsequent projection step onto a considered function space. It has been observed that this scheme can be potentially generalized to carry out multiple iterations of the Bellman operator at once, benefiting the underlying learning algorithm. However, till now, it has been challenging to effectively implement this idea, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we introduce iterated $Q$-Network (iQN), a novel principled approach that enables multiple consecutive Bellman updates by learning a tailored sequence of action-value functions where each serves as the target for the next. We show that iQN is theoretically grounded and that it can be seamlessly used in value-based and actor-critic methods. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of iQN in Atari $2600$ games and MuJoCo continuous control problems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to the problem of mutual information (MI) estimation via introducing a family of estimators based on normalizing flows. The estimator maps original data to the target distribution, for which MI is easier to estimate. We additionally explore the target distributions with known closed-form expressions for MI. Theoretical guarantees are provided to demonstrate that our approach yields MI estimates for the original data. Experiments with high-dimensional data are conducted to highlight the practical advantages of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Effectively representing heterogeneous tabular datasets for meta-learning remains an open problem. Previous approaches rely on predefined meta-features, for example, statistical measures or landmarkers. Encoder-based models, such as Dataset2Vec, allow us to extract significant meta-features automatically without human intervention. This research introduces a novel encoder-based representation of tabular datasets implemented within the liltab package available on GitHub https://github.com/azoz01/liltab. Our package is based on an established model for heterogeneous tabular data proposed in [Tomoharu Iwata and Atsutoshi Kumagai. Meta-learning from Tasks with Heterogeneous Attribute Spaces. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020]. The proposed approach employs a different model for encoding feature relationships, generating alternative representations compared to existing methods like Dataset2Vec. Both of them leverage the fundamental assumption of dataset similarity learning. In this work, we evaluate Dataset2Vec and liltab on two common meta-tasks -- representing entire datasets and hyperparameter optimization warm-start. However, validation on an independent metaMIMIC dataset highlights the nuanced challenges in representation learning. We show that general representations may not suffice for some meta-tasks where requirements are not explicitly considered during extraction.</description>

      <title>Improving Implicit Regularization of SGD with Preconditioning for Least Square Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits strong algorithmic regularization effects in practice and plays an important role in the generalization of modern machine learning. However, prior research has revealed instances where the generalization performance of SGD is worse than ridge regression due to uneven optimization along different dimensions. Preconditioning offers a natural solution to this issue by rebalancing optimization across different directions. Yet, the extent to which preconditioning can enhance the generalization performance of SGD and whether it can bridge the existing gap with ridge regression remains uncertain. In this paper, we study the generalization performance of SGD with preconditioning for the least squared problem. We make a comprehensive comparison between preconditioned SGD and (standard \&amp; preconditioned) ridge regression. Our study makes several key contributions toward understanding and improving SGD with preconditioning. First, we establish excess risk bounds (generalization performance) for preconditioned SGD and ridge regression under an arbitrary preconditions matrix. Second, leveraging the excessive risk characterization of preconditioned SGD and ridge regression, we show that (through construction) there exists a simple preconditioned matrix that can make SGD comparable to (standard \&amp; preconditioned) ridge regression. Finally, we show that our proposed preconditioning matrix is straightforward enough to allow robust estimation from finite samples while maintaining a theoretical improvement. Our empirical results align with our theoretical findings, collectively showcasing the enhanced regularization effect of preconditioned SGD.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel theoretical simplification of the Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge (DSB) that facilitates its unification with Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), addressing the limitations of DSB in complex data generation and enabling faster convergence and enhanced performance. By employing SGMs as an initial solution for DSB, our approach capitalizes on the strengths of both frameworks, ensuring a more efficient training process and improving the performance of SGM. We also propose a reparameterization technique that, despite theoretical approximations, practically improves the network's fitting capabilities. Our extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the simplified DSB, demonstrating its significant improvements. We believe the contributions of this work pave the way for advanced generative modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/checkcrab/SDSB.</description>

Abstract: Predicting temporal patterns across various domains poses significant challenges due to their nuanced and often nonlinear trajectories. To address this challenge, prediction frameworks have been continuously refined, employing data-driven statistical methods, mathematical models, and machine learning. Recently, as one of the challenging systems, shared transport systems such as public bicycles have gained prominence due to urban constraints and environmental concerns. Predicting rental and return patterns at bicycle stations remains a formidable task due to the system's openness and imbalanced usage patterns across stations. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework to predict rental and return patterns by leveraging cartogram approaches. The cartogram approach facilitates the prediction of demand for newly installed stations with no training data as well as long-period prediction, which has not been achieved before. We apply this method to public bicycle rental-and-return data in Seoul, South Korea, employing a spatial-temporal convolutional graph attention network. Our improved architecture incorporates batch attention and modified node feature updates for better prediction accuracy across different time scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in predicting temporal patterns and its potential applications.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Agents Have Regret? A Case Study in Online Learning and Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for (interactive) decision-making, via the development of LLM-based autonomous agents. Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of \emph{regret}. We first empirically study the {no-regret} behaviors of LLMs in canonical (non-stationary) online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel \emph{unsupervised} training loss of \emph{regret-loss}, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. We then establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, followed by the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above ``regrettable'' cases.</description>

      <title>GPFL: A Gradient Projection-Based Client Selection Framework for Efficient Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning client selection is crucial for determining participant clients while balancing model accuracy and communication efficiency. Existing methods have limitations in handling data heterogeneity, computational burdens, and independent client treatment. To address these challenges, we propose GPFL, which measures client value by comparing local and global descent directions. We also employ an Exploit-Explore mechanism to enhance performance. Experimental results on FEMINST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that GPFL outperforms baselines in Non-IID scenarios, achieving over 9\% improvement in FEMINST test accuracy. Moreover, GPFL exhibits shorter computation times through pre-selection and parameter reuse in federated learning.</description>

      <title>LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</description>

      <title>K-percent Evaluation for Lifelong RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In continual or lifelong reinforcement learning, access to the environment should be limited. If we aspire to design algorithms that can run for long periods, continually adapting to new, unexpected situations, then we must be willing to deploy our agents without tuning their hyperparameters over the agent's entire lifetime. The standard practice in deep RL, and even continual RL, is to assume unfettered access to the deployment environment for the full lifetime of the agent. In this paper, we propose a new approach for evaluating lifelong RL agents where only k percent of the experiment data can be used for hyperparameter tuning. We then conduct an empirical study of DQN and SAC across a variety of continuing and non-stationary domains. We find agents generally perform poorly when restricted to k-percent tuning, whereas several algorithmic mitigations designed to maintain network plasticity perform surprisingly well.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions of Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we study the mean square asymptotic stability of a class of random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences dependent on the homogeneous ones. Secondly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path, and show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying in some sense, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the regularization path in mean square. Furthermore, if the data streams also satisfy the RKHS persistence of excitation condition, i.e. there exists a fixed length of time period, such that each eigenvalue of the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every time period has a uniformly positive lower bound with respect to time, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the unknown function in mean square. Finally, for the case with independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency provided the marginal probability measures induced by the input data are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>AnchorAL: Computationally Efficient Active Learning for Large and Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning for imbalanced classification tasks is challenging as the minority classes naturally occur rarely. Gathering a large pool of unlabelled data is thus essential to capture minority instances. Standard pool-based active learning is computationally expensive on large pools and often reaches low accuracy by overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus failing to explore the input space and find minority instances. To address these issues we propose AnchorAL. At each iteration, AnchorAL chooses class-specific instances from the labelled set, or anchors, and retrieves the most similar unlabelled instances from the pool. This resulting subpool is then used for active learning. Using a small, fixed-sized subpool AnchorAL allows scaling any active learning strategy to large pools. By dynamically selecting different anchors at each iteration it promotes class balance and prevents overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus promoting the discovery of new clusters of minority instances. In experiments across different classification tasks, active learning strategies, and model architectures AnchorAL is (i) faster, often reducing runtime from hours to minutes, (ii) trains more performant models, (iii) and returns more balanced datasets than competing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skill acquisition is a key area of research in cognitive psychology as it encompasses multiple psychological processes. The laws discovered under experimental paradigms are controversial and lack generalizability. This paper aims to unearth the laws of skill learning from large-scale training log data. A two-stage algorithm was developed to tackle the issues of unobservable cognitive states and algorithmic explosion in searching. Initially a deep learning model is employed to determine the learner's cognitive state and assess the feature importance. Subsequently, symbolic regression algorithms are utilized to parse the neural network model into algebraic equations. Experimental results show the algorithm can accurately restore preset laws within a noise range in continuous feedback settings. When applied to Lumosity training data, the method outperforms traditional and recent models in fitness terms. The study reveals two new forms of skill acquisition laws and reaffirms some previous findings.</description>

      <title>Tripod: Three Complementary Inductive Biases for Disentangled Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inductive biases are crucial in disentangled representation learning for narrowing down an underspecified solution set. In this work, we consider endowing a neural network autoencoder with three select inductive biases from the literature: data compression into a grid-like latent space via quantization, collective independence amongst latents, and minimal functional influence of any latent on how other latents determine data generation. In principle, these inductive biases are deeply complementary: they most directly specify properties of the latent space, encoder, and decoder, respectively. In practice, however, naively combining existing techniques instantiating these inductive biases fails to yield significant benefits. To address this, we propose adaptations to the three techniques that simplify the learning problem, equip key regularization terms with stabilizing invariances, and quash degenerate incentives. The resulting model, Tripod, achieves state-of-the-art results on a suite of four image disentanglement benchmarks. We also verify that Tripod significantly improves upon its naive incarnation and that all three of its "legs" are necessary for best performance.</description>

      <title>LTL-Constrained Policy Optimization with Cycle Experience Replay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offers a precise means for constraining the behavior of reinforcement learning agents. However, in many tasks, LTL is insufficient for task specification; LTL-constrained policy optimization, where the goal is to optimize a scalar reward under LTL constraints, is needed. Prior methods for this constrained problem are restricted to finite state spaces. In this work, we present Cycle Experience Replay (CyclER), a reward-shaping approach to this problem that allows continuous state and action spaces and the use of function approximations. CyclER guides a policy towards satisfaction by encouraging partial behaviors compliant with the LTL constraint, using the structure of the constraint. In doing so, it addresses the optimization challenges stemming from the sparse nature of LTL satisfaction. We evaluate CyclER in three continuous control domains. On these tasks, CyclER outperforms existing reward-shaping methods at finding performant and LTL-satisfying policies.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Analysis of Neural Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent for Functional Minimiax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies minimax optimization problems defined over infinite-dimensional function classes of overparameterized two-layer neural networks. In particular, we consider the minimax optimization problem stemming from estimating linear functional equations defined by conditional expectations, where the objective functions are quadratic in the functional spaces. We address (i) the convergence of the stochastic gradient descent-ascent algorithm and (ii) the representation learning of the neural networks. We establish convergence under the mean-field regime by considering the continuous-time and infinite-width limit of the optimization dynamics. Under this regime, the stochastic gradient descent-ascent corresponds to a Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of probability measures defined over the space of neural network parameters. We prove that the Wasserstein gradient flow converges globally to a stationary point of the minimax objective at a $O(T^{-1} + \alpha^{-1})$ sublinear rate, and additionally finds the solution to the functional equation when the regularizer of the minimax objective is strongly convex. Here $T$ denotes the time and $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter of the neural networks. In terms of representation learning, our results show that the feature representation induced by the neural networks is allowed to deviate from the initial one by the magnitude of $O(\alpha^{-1})$, measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance. Finally, we apply our general results to concrete examples including policy evaluation, nonparametric instrumental variable regression, asset pricing, and adversarial Riesz representer estimation.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning capabilities across various domains. Inspired by this, our study explores the effectiveness of LLMs in generating realistic tabular data to mitigate class imbalance. We investigate and identify key prompt design elements such as data format, class presentation, and variable mapping to optimize the generation performance. Our findings indicate that using CSV format, balancing classes, and employing unique variable mapping produces realistic and reliable data, significantly enhancing machine learning performance for minor classes in imbalanced datasets. Additionally, these approaches improve the stability and efficiency of LLM data generation. We validate our approach using six real-world datasets and a toy dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification tasks.

      <title>Explicit Lipschitz Value Estimation Enhances Policy Robustness Against Perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In robotic control tasks, policies trained by reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation often experience a performance drop when deployed on physical hardware, due to modeling error, measurement error, and unpredictable perturbations in the real world. Robust RL methods account for this issue by approximating a worst-case value function during training, but they can be sensitive to approximation errors in the value function and its gradient before training is complete. In this paper, we hypothesize that Lipschitz regularization can help condition the approximated value function gradients, leading to improved robustness after training. We test this hypothesis by combining Lipschitz regularization with an application of Fast Gradient Sign Method to reduce approximation errors when evaluating the value function under adversarial perturbations. Our empirical results demonstrate the benefits of this approach over prior work on a number of continuous control benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of generative modeling based on differential equations, conventional methods utilize scalar-valued time during both the training and inference phases. This work introduces, for the first time, a tensor-valued time that expands the conventional scalar-valued time into multiple dimensions. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem designed to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories using a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our approach leverages the stochastic interpolant framework, simulation dynamics, and adversarial training to optimize the inference pathway. Notably, incorporating tensor-valued time during training improves some models' inference performance, even without path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, further performance gains are achieved despite the fixed solver configurations. The introduction of tensor-valued time not only enhances the efficiency of models but also opens new avenues for exploration in training and inference methodologies, highlighting the potential of adaptive multidimensional paths.</description>

      <title>FeDeRA:Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models in Federated Learning Leveraging Weight Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their exceptional performance on various tasks after fine-tuning, pre-trained language models (PLMs) face significant challenges due to growing privacy concerns with data in centralized training methods. We consider federated learning (FL) to fine-tune PLMs in this paper. However, the substantial number of parameters in PLMs poses significant difficulties for client devices with limited communication and computational resources. One promising solution is to exploit parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) into FL, which trains a much smaller set of parameters than full parameter fine-tuning (FFT). Although remarkably improving training efficiency, PEFT methods may lead to degraded performance especially when data across different clients are non i.i.d, as revealed by experimental results. To overcome this, we propose FeDeRA, which extends and improves a widely used PEFT method, i.e., low-rank adaption (LoRA). FeDeRA follows LoRA by decomposing the weight matrices of the PLMs into low-rank matrices, which allows for more efficient computation and parameter updates during fine-tuning. Different from LoRA which simply initializes these low-rank matrices by random sampling or zeros, the proposed FeDeRA initializes these matrices by the results of performing singular value decomposition (SVD) on the pre-trained weight matrices. Extensive experiments across various tasks and datasets show that FeDeRA outperforms the considered PEFT baselines and is comparable to or even surpasses FFT method within the FL setting in terms of task performance. Moreover, FeDeRA requires only 1% trainable paramentes compared to FFT, significantly reducing training time costs by more than 90% to achieve the same task performance level. The experimental results also highlight the robustness of FeDeRA against data heterogeneity, as it maintains stable task performance even as data heterogeneity increases.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-play Probabilistic Preference Optimization} (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys a theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53\% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.</description>

Abstract: We warn against a common but incomplete understanding of empirical research in machine learning that leads to non-replicable results, makes findings unreliable, and threatens to undermine progress in the field. To overcome this alarming situation, we call for more awareness of the plurality of ways of gaining knowledge experimentally but also of some epistemic limitations. In particular, we argue most current empirical machine learning research is fashioned as confirmatory research while it should rather be considered exploratory.</description>

      <title>Understanding Server-Assisted Federated Learning in the Presence of Incomplete Client Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing works in federated learning (FL) often assume an ideal system with either full client or uniformly distributed client participation. However, in practice, it has been observed that some clients may never participate in FL training (aka incomplete client participation) due to a myriad of system heterogeneity factors. A popular approach to mitigate impacts of incomplete client participation is the server-assisted federated learning (SA-FL) framework, where the server is equipped with an auxiliary dataset. However, despite SA-FL has been empirically shown to be effective in addressing the incomplete client participation problem, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding for SA-FL. Meanwhile, the ramifications of incomplete client participation in conventional FL are also poorly understood. These theoretical gaps motivate us to rigorously investigate SA-FL. Toward this end, we first show that conventional FL is {\em not} PAC-learnable under incomplete client participation in the worst case. Then, we show that the PAC-learnability of FL with incomplete client participation can indeed be revived by SA-FL, which theoretically justifies the use of SA-FL for the first time. Lastly, to provide practical guidance for SA-FL training under {\em incomplete client participation}, we propose the $\mathsf{SAFARI}$ (server-assisted federated averaging) algorithm that enjoys the same linear convergence speedup guarantees as classic FL with ideal client participation assumptions, offering the first SA-FL algorithm with convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments on different datasets show $\mathsf{SAFARI}$ significantly improves the performance under incomplete client participation.</description>

      <title>On the Tractability of SHAP Explanations under Markovian Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to its solid theoretical foundation, the SHAP framework is arguably one the most widely utilized frameworks for local explainability of ML models. Despite its popularity, its exact computation is known to be very challenging, proven to be NP-Hard in various configurations. Recent works have unveiled positive complexity results regarding the computation of the SHAP score for specific model families, encompassing decision trees, random forests, and some classes of boolean circuits. Yet, all these positive results hinge on the assumption of feature independence, often simplistic in real-world scenarios. In this article, we investigate the computational complexity of the SHAP score by relaxing this assumption and introducing a Markovian perspective. We show that, under the Markovian assumption, computing the SHAP score for the class of Weighted automata, Disjoint DNFs and Decision Trees can be performed in polynomial time, offering a first positive complexity result for the problem of SHAP score computation that transcends the limitations of the feature independence assumption.</description>

      <title>TimeMIL: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Classification via a Time-aware Multiple Instance Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks, including transformers and convolutional neural networks, have significantly improved multivariate time series classification (MTSC). However, these methods often rely on supervised learning, which does not fully account for the sparsity and locality of patterns in time series data (e.g., diseases-related anomalous points in ECG). To address this challenge, we formally reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token. The proposed method surpassed 26 recent state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the effectiveness of the weakly supervised TimeMIL in MTSC. The code will be available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/TimeMIL.</description>

Abstract: The backpropagation algorithm, or backprop, is a widely utilized optimization technique in deep learning. While there's growing evidence suggesting that models trained with backprop can accurately explain neuronal data, no backprop-like method has yet been discovered in the biological brain for learning. Moreover, employing a naive implementation of backprop in the brain has several drawbacks. In 2022, Geoffrey Hinton proposed a biologically plausible learning method known as the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm. Shortly after this paper, a modified version called FFCL was introduced. However, FFCL had limitations, notably being a three-stage learning system where the final stage still relied on regular backpropagation. In our approach, we address these drawbacks by eliminating the last two stages of FFCL and completely removing regular backpropagation. Instead, we rely solely on local updates, offering a more biologically plausible alternative.</description>

      <title>Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, particularly the selection of an appropriate learning rate in adaptive gradient training methods, remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel parameter-free optimizer, \textsc{AdamG} (Adam with the golden step size), designed to automatically adapt to diverse optimization problems without manual tuning. The core technique underlying \textsc{AdamG} is our golden step size derived for the AdaGrad-Norm algorithm, which is expected to help AdaGrad-Norm preserve the tuning-free convergence and approximate the optimal step size in expectation w.r.t. various optimization scenarios. To better evaluate tuning-free performance, we propose a novel evaluation criterion, \textit{reliability}, to comprehensively assess the efficacy of parameter-free optimizers in addition to classical performance criteria. Empirical results demonstrate that compared with other parameter-free baselines, \textsc{AdamG} achieves superior performance, which is consistently on par with Adam using a manually tuned learning rate across various optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>ALPINE: Unveiling the Planning Capability of Autoregressive Learning in Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the findings of our Project ALPINE which stands for ``Autoregressive Learning for Planning In NEtworks." Project ALPINE initiates a theoretical investigation into the development of planning capabilities in Transformer-based language models through their autoregressive learning mechanisms, aiming to identify any potential limitations in their planning abilities. We abstract planning as a network path-finding task where the objective is to generate a valid path from a specified source node to a designated target node. In terms of expressiveness, we show that the Transformer is capable of executing path-finding by embedding the adjacency and reachability matrices within its weights. Our theoretical analysis of the gradient-based learning dynamic of the Transformer reveals that the Transformer is capable of learning both the adjacency matrix and a limited form of the reachability matrix. These theoretical insights are then validated through experiments, which demonstrate that the Transformer indeed learns the adjacency matrix and an incomplete reachability matrix, which aligns with the predictions made in our theoretical analysis. Additionally, when applying our methodology to a real-world planning benchmark, called Blocksworld, our observations remain consistent. Our theoretical and empirical analyses further unveil a potential limitation of Transformer in path-finding: it cannot identify reachability relationships through transitivity, and thus would fail when path concatenation is needed to generate a path. In summary, our findings shed new light on how the internal mechanisms of autoregressive learning enable planning in networks. This study may contribute to our understanding of the general planning capabilities in other related domains.</description>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer an efficient and interpretable alternative to traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures due to their finite network topology. However, according to the results of Kolmogorov and Vitushkin, the representation of generic smooth functions by KAN implementations using analytic functions constrained to a finite number of cutoff points cannot be exact. Hence, the convergence of KAN throughout the training process may be limited. This paper explores the relevance of smoothness in KANs, proposing that smooth, structurally informed KANs can achieve equivalence to MLPs in specific function classes. By leveraging inherent structural knowledge, KANs may reduce the data required for training and mitigate the risk of generating hallucinated predictions, thereby enhancing model reliability and performance in computational biomedicine.</description>

      <title>NetMamba: Efficient Network Traffic Classification via Pre-training Unidirectional Mamba</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network traffic classification is a crucial research area aiming to enhance service quality, streamline network management, and bolster cybersecurity. To address the growing complexity of transmission encryption techniques, various machine learning and deep learning methods have been proposed. However, existing approaches face two main challenges. Firstly, they struggle with model inefficiency due to the quadratic complexity of the widely used Transformer architecture. Secondly, they suffer from inadequate traffic representation because of discarding important byte information while retaining unwanted biases. To address these challenges, we propose NetMamba, an efficient linear-time state space model equipped with a comprehensive traffic representation scheme. We adopt a specially selected and improved unidirectional Mamba architecture for the networking field, instead of the Transformer, to address efficiency issues. In addition, we design a traffic representation scheme to extract valid information from massive traffic data while removing biased information. Evaluation experiments on six public datasets encompassing three main classification tasks showcase NetMamba's superior classification performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves an accuracy rate of nearly 99% (some over 99%) in all tasks. Additionally, NetMamba demonstrates excellent efficiency, improving inference speed by up to 60 times while maintaining comparably low memory usage. Furthermore, NetMamba exhibits superior few-shot learning abilities, achieving better classification performance with fewer labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, NetMamba is the first model to tailor the Mamba architecture for networking.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Batch Normalization Networks for Adversarial Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversarial Training (AT) has been a standard foundation of modern adversarial defense approaches due to its remarkable effectiveness. However, AT is extremely time-consuming, refraining it from wide deployment in practical applications. In this paper, we aim at a non-AT defense: How to design a defense method that gets rid of AT but is still robust against strong adversarial attacks? To answer this question, we resort to adaptive Batch Normalization (BN), inspired by the recent advances in test-time domain adaptation. We propose a novel defense accordingly, referred to as the Adaptive Batch Normalization Network (ABNN). ABNN employs a pre-trained substitute model to generate clean BN statistics and sends them to the target model. The target model is exclusively trained on clean data and learns to align the substitute model's BN statistics. Experimental results show that ABNN consistently improves adversarial robustness against both digital and physically realizable attacks on both image and video datasets. Furthermore, ABNN can achieve higher clean data performance and significantly lower training time complexity compared to AT-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph: A Unified and Uniform Definition with Application to Chemical Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes a mathematical foundation for the Adam optimizer, elucidating its connection to natural gradient descent through Riemannian and information geometry. We rigorously analyze the diagonal empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) in Adam, clarifying all detailed approximations and advocating for the use of log probability functions as loss, which should be based on discrete distributions, due to the limitations of empirical FIM. Our analysis uncovers flaws in the original Adam algorithm, leading to proposed corrections such as enhanced momentum calculations, adjusted bias corrections, adaptive epsilon, and gradient clipping. We refine the weight decay term based on our theoretical framework. Our modified algorithm, Fisher Adam (FAdam), demonstrates superior performance across diverse domains including LLM, ASR, and VQ-VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results in ASR.</description>

      <title>Wav-KAN: Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Wav-KAN, an innovative neural network architecture that leverages the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Wav-KAN) framework to enhance interpretability and performance. Traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and even recent advancements like Spl-KAN face challenges related to interpretability, training speed, robustness, computational efficiency, and performance. Wav-KAN addresses these limitations by incorporating wavelet functions into the Kolmogorov-Arnold network structure, enabling the network to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data efficiently. Wavelet-based approximations employ orthogonal or semi-orthogonal basis and maintain a balance between accurately representing the underlying data structure and avoiding overfitting to the noise. While continuous wavelet transform (CWT) has a lot of potentials, we also employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for multiresolution analysis, which obviated the need for recalculation of the previous steps in finding the details. Analogous to how water conforms to the shape of its container, Wav-KAN adapts to the data structure, resulting in enhanced accuracy, faster training speeds, and increased robustness compared to Spl-KAN and MLPs. Our results highlight the potential of Wav-KAN as a powerful tool for developing interpretable and high-performance neural networks, with applications spanning various fields. This work sets the stage for further exploration and implementation of Wav-KAN in frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, aiming to make wavelets in KAN as widespread as activation functions like ReLU and sigmoid in universal approximation theory (UAT).

Abstract: Stochastic gradient methods are among the most important algorithms in training machine learning problems. While classical assumptions such as strong convexity allow a simple analysis they are rarely satisfied in applications. In recent years, global and local gradient domination properties have shown to be a more realistic replacement of strong convexity. They were proved to hold in diverse settings such as (simple) policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning and training of deep neural networks with analytic activation functions. We prove almost sure convergence rates $f(X_n)-f^*\in o\big( n^{-\frac{1}{4\beta-1}+\epsilon}\big)$ of the last iterate for stochastic gradient descent (with and without momentum) under global and local $\beta$-gradient domination assumptions. The almost sure rates get arbitrarily close to recent rates in expectation. Finally, we demonstrate how to apply our results to the training task in both supervised and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</description>

      <title>Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</description>

      <title>Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic graphs are pervasive in the real world, modeling dynamic relations between objects across various fields. For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. A prevalent approach involves training a conditional generative model on existing designs and their associated scores, followed by the generation of new designs conditioned on higher target scores. However, these newly generated designs often underperform due to the lack of high-scoring training data. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which consists of two phases. In the first phase, termed pseudo-target distribution generation, we apply gradient ascent on the offline dataset using a trained surrogate model, producing a synthetic dataset where the predicted scores serve as new labels. A conditional diffusion model is subsequently trained on this synthetic dataset to capture a pseudo-target distribution, which enhances the accuracy of the conditional diffusion model in generating higher-scoring designs. Nevertheless, the pseudo-target distribution is susceptible to noise stemming from inaccuracies in the surrogate model, consequently predisposing the conditional diffusion model to generate suboptimal designs. We hence propose the second phase, existing design editing, to directly incorporate the high-scoring features from the offline dataset into design generation. In this phase, top designs from the offline dataset are edited by introducing noise, which are subsequently refined using the conditional diffusion model to produce high-scoring designs. Overall, high-scoring designs begin with inheriting high-scoring features from the second phase and are further refined with a more accurate conditional diffusion model in the first phase. Empirical evaluations on 7 offline MBO tasks show that DEMO outperforms various baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Attending to Topological Spaces: The Cellular Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological Deep Learning seeks to enhance the predictive performance of neural network models by harnessing topological structures in input data. Topological neural networks operate on spaces such as cell complexes and hypergraphs, that can be seen as generalizations of graphs. In this work, we introduce the Cellular Transformer (CT), a novel architecture that generalizes graph-based transformers to cell complexes. First, we propose a new formulation of the usual self- and cross-attention mechanisms, tailored to leverage incidence relations in cell complexes, e.g., edge-face and node-edge relations. Additionally, we propose a set of topological positional encodings specifically designed for cell complexes. By transforming three graph datasets into cell complex datasets, our experiments reveal that CT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but it does so without the need for more complex enhancements such as virtual nodes, in-domain structural encodings, or graph rewiring.</description>

      <title>Time-FFM: Towards LM-Empowered Federated Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</description>

      <title>Boosting Robustness by Clipping Gradients in Distributed Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust distributed learning consists in achieving good learning performance despite the presence of misbehaving workers. State-of-the-art (SOTA) robust distributed gradient descent (Robust-DGD) methods, relying on robust aggregation, have been proven to be optimal: Their learning error matches the lower bound established under the standard heterogeneity model of $(G, B)$-gradient dissimilarity. The learning guarantee of SOTA Robust-DGD cannot be further improved when model initialization is done arbitrarily. However, we show that it is possible to circumvent the lower bound, and improve the learning performance, when the workers' gradients at model initialization are assumed to be bounded. We prove this by proposing pre-aggregation clipping of workers' gradients, using a novel scheme called adaptive robust clipping (ARC). Incorporating ARC in Robust-DGD provably improves the learning, under the aforementioned assumption on model initialization. The factor of improvement is prominent when the tolerable fraction of misbehaving workers approaches the breakdown point. ARC induces this improvement by constricting the search space, while preserving the robustness property of the original aggregation scheme at the same time. We validate this theoretical finding through exhaustive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Worldwide Federated Training of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliance of language model training on massive amounts of computation and vast datasets scraped from potentially low-quality, copyrighted, or sensitive data has come into question practically, legally, and ethically. Federated learning provides a plausible alternative by enabling previously untapped data to be voluntarily gathered from collaborating organizations. However, when scaled globally, federated learning requires collaboration across heterogeneous legal, security, and privacy regimes while accounting for the inherent locality of language data; this further exacerbates the established challenge of federated statistical heterogeneity. We propose a Worldwide Federated Language Model Training~(WorldLM) system based on federations of federations, where each federation has the autonomy to account for factors such as its industry, operating jurisdiction, or competitive environment. WorldLM enables such autonomy in the presence of statistical heterogeneity via partial model localization by allowing sub-federations to attentively aggregate key layers from their constituents. Furthermore, it can adaptively share information across federations via residual layer embeddings. Evaluations of language modeling on naturally heterogeneous datasets show that WorldLM outperforms standard federations by up to $1.91\times$, approaches the personalized performance of fully local models, and maintains these advantages under privacy-enhancing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is an emerging and challenging task where a model trained in a source domain must adapt to continuously changing conditions during testing, without access to the original source data. CTTA is prone to error accumulation due to uncontrollable domain shifts, leading to blurred decision boundaries between categories. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on suppressing domain shifts, which proves inadequate during the unsupervised test phase. In contrast, we introduce a novel approach that guides rather than suppresses these shifts. Specifically, we propose $\textbf{C}$ontrollable $\textbf{Co}$ntinual $\textbf{T}$est-$\textbf{T}$ime $\textbf{A}$daptation (C-CoTTA), which explicitly prevents any single category from encroaching on others, thereby mitigating the mutual influence between categories caused by uncontrollable shifts. Moreover, our method reduces the sensitivity of model to domain transformations, thereby minimizing the magnitude of category shifts. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, while qualitative analyses, such as t-SNE plots, confirm the theoretical validity of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress by integrating pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and vision models through instruction tuning. Despite these advancements, LVLMs often exhibit the hallucination phenomenon, where generated text responses appear linguistically plausible but contradict the input image, indicating a misalignment between image and text pairs. This misalignment arises because the model tends to prioritize textual information over visual input, even when both the language model and visual representations are of high quality. Existing methods leverage additional models or human annotations to curate preference data and enhance modality alignment through preference optimization. These approaches may not effectively reflect the target LVLM's preferences, making the curated preferences easily distinguishable. Our work addresses these challenges by proposing the Calibrated Self-Rewarding (CSR) approach, which enables the model to self-improve by iteratively generating candidate responses, evaluating the reward for each response, and curating preference data for fine-tuning. In the reward modeling, we employ a step-wise strategy and incorporate visual constraints into the self-rewarding process to place greater emphasis on visual input. Empirical results demonstrate that CSR enhances performance and reduces hallucinations across ten benchmarks and tasks, achieving substantial improvements over existing methods by 7.62%. Our empirical results are further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis, under mild assumptions, verifying the effectiveness of introducing visual constraints into the self-rewarding paradigm. Additionally, CSR shows compatibility with different vision-language models and the ability to incrementally improve performance through iterative fine-tuning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/CSR.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Neural Networks for Reversible Dissipative Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing attention given to utilizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics with network training in order to incorporate physics into the network. Most commonly, conservative systems are modeled, in which there are no frictional losses, so the system may be run forward and backward in time without requiring regularization. This work addresses systems in which the reverse direction is ill-posed because of the dissipation that occurs in forward evolution. The novelty is the use of Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian, which models dissipative dynamics by doubling the number of dimensions of the system in order to create a mirror latent representation that would counterbalance the dissipation of the observable system, making it a conservative system, albeit embedded in a larger space. We start with their formal approach by redefining a new Dissipative Lagrangian, such that the unknown matrices in the Euler-Lagrange's equations arise as partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to only the observables. We then train a network from simulated training data for dissipative systems such as Fickian diffusion that arise in materials sciences. It is shown by experiments that the systems can be evolved in both forward and reverse directions without regularization beyond that provided by the Morse-Feshbach Lagrangian. Experiments of dissipative systems, such as Fickian diffusion, demonstrate the degree to which dynamics can be reversed.</description>

      <title>Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspective by considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the $\textit{Fisher-Rao metric}$. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-Flow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence.
  We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Early Exits for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Clients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled distributed learning of a model across multiple clients in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the main challenges of FL is to accommodate clients with varying hardware capacities; clients have differing compute and memory requirements. To tackle this challenge, recent state-of-the-art approaches leverage the use of early exits. Nonetheless, these approaches fall short of mitigating the challenges of joint learning multiple exit classifiers, often relying on hand-picked heuristic solutions for knowledge distillation among classifiers and/or utilizing additional layers for weaker classifiers. In this work, instead of utilizing multiple classifiers, we propose a recurrent early exit approach named ReeFL that fuses features from different sub-models into a single shared classifier. Specifically, we use a transformer-based early-exit module shared among sub-models to i) better exploit multi-layer feature representations for task-specific prediction and ii) modulate the feature representation of the backbone model for subsequent predictions. We additionally present a per-client self-distillation approach where the best sub-model is automatically selected as the teacher of the other sub-models at each client.

      <title>Analysis of Atom-level pretraining with Quantum Mechanics (QM) data for Graph Neural Networks Molecular property models</title>

Abstract: Despite the rapid and significant advancements in deep learning for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, the challenge of learning robust molecular representations that effectively generalize in real-world scenarios to novel compounds remains an elusive and unresolved task. This study examines how atom-level pretraining with quantum mechanics (QM) data can mitigate violations of assumptions regarding the distributional similarity between training and test data and therefore improve performance and generalization in downstream tasks. In the public dataset Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), we show how pretraining on atom-level QM improves performance overall and makes the activation of the features distributes more Gaussian-like which results in a representation that is more robust to distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that hidden state molecular representations are analyzed to compare the effects of molecule-level and atom-level pretraining on QM data.</description>

      <title>Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.</description>

      <title>NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series imputation plays a crucial role in various real-world systems and has been extensively explored. Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimator selection and hyper-parameter tuning in off-policy evaluation. Although cross-validation is the most popular method for model selection in supervised learning, off-policy evaluation relies mostly on theory-based approaches, which provide only limited guidance to practitioners. We show how to use cross-validation for off-policy evaluation. This challenges a popular belief that cross-validation in off-policy evaluation is not feasible. We evaluate our method empirically and show that it addresses a variety of use cases.</description>

      <title>HyperInterval: Hypernetwork approach to training weight interval regions in continual learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HyperInterval, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HyperInterval maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and can be seen as a meta-trainer. HyperInterval obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Independent Cross-Entropy Loss For Graph-Structured Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited prominent performance in learning graph-structured data. Considering node classification task, based on the i.i.d assumption among node labels, the traditional supervised learning simply sums up cross-entropy losses of the independent training nodes and applies the average loss to optimize GNNs' weights. But different from other data formats, the nodes are naturally connected. It is found that the independent distribution modeling of node labels restricts GNNs' capability to generalize over the entire graph and defend adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework, termed joint-cluster supervised learning, to model the joint distribution of each node with its corresponding cluster. We learn the joint distribution of node and cluster labels conditioned on their representations, and train GNNs with the obtained joint loss. In this way, the data-label reference signals extracted from the local cluster explicitly strengthen the discrimination ability on the target node. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our joint-cluster supervised learning can effectively bolster GNNs' node classification accuracy. Furthermore, being benefited from the reference signals which may be free from spiteful interference, our learning paradigm significantly protects the node classification from being affected by the adversarial attack.</description>

      <title>Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature for Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infamous for being hard to train. Recently, second-order methods based on natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods have shown promising performance, improving the accuracy achieved by first-order methods by several orders of magnitude. While promising, the proposed methods only scale to networks with a few thousand parameters due to the high computational cost to evaluate, store, and invert the curvature matrix. We propose Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) for PINN losses that greatly reduces the computational cost and allows scaling to much larger networks. Our approach goes beyond the established KFAC for traditional deep learning problems as it captures contributions from a PDE's differential operator that are crucial for optimization. To establish KFAC for such losses, we use Taylor-mode automatic differentiation to describe the differential operator's computation graph as a forward network with shared weights. This allows us to apply KFAC thanks to a recently-developed general formulation for networks with weight sharing. Empirically, we find that our KFAC-based optimizers are competitive with expensive second-order methods on small problems, scale more favorably to higher-dimensional neural networks and PDEs, and consistently outperform first-order methods and LBFGS.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an ever present part in our lives as many decisions, e.g. to lend a credit, are no longer made by humans but by machine learning algorithms. However those decisions are often unfair and discriminating individuals belonging to protected groups based on race or gender. With the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect, new awareness has been raised for such issues and with computer scientists having such a large impact on peoples lives it is necessary that actions are taken to discover and prevent discrimination. This work aims to give an introduction into discrimination, legislative foundations to counter it and strategies to detect and prevent machine learning algorithms from showing such behavior.</description>

      <title>Outcome-Driven Dynamic Refugee Assignment with Allocation Balancing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.03069v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes two new dynamic assignment algorithms to match refugees and asylum seekers to geographic localities within a host country. The first, currently implemented in a multi-year randomized control trial in Switzerland, seeks to maximize the average predicted employment level (or any measured outcome of interest) of refugees through a minimum-discord online assignment algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is tested on real refugee resettlement data from both the US and Switzerland, where we find that it is able to achieve near-optimal expected employment compared to the hindsight-optimal solution, and is able to improve upon the status quo procedure by 40-50%. However, pure outcome maximization can result in a periodically imbalanced allocation to the localities over time, leading to implementation difficulties and an undesirable workflow for resettlement resources and agents. To address these problems, the second algorithm balances the goal of improving refugee outcomes with the desire for an even allocation over time. We find that this algorithm can achieve near-perfect balance over time with only a small loss in expected employment compared to the employment-maximizing algorithm. In addition, the allocation balancing algorithm offers a number of ancillary benefits compared to pure outcome maximization, including robustness to unknown arrival flows and greater exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.14814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steepest descent algorithms, which are commonly used in deep learning, use the gradient as the descent direction, either as-is or after a direction shift using preconditioning. In many scenarios calculating the gradient is numerically hard due to complex or non-differentiable cost functions, specifically next to singular points. In this work we focus on the derivation of the Total Variation semi-norm commonly used in unsupervised cost functions. Specifically, we derive a differentiable proxy to the hard L1 smoothness constraint in a novel iterative scheme which we refer to as Cost Unrolling. Producing more accurate gradients during training, our method enables finer predictions of a given DNN model through improved convergence, without modifying its architecture or increasing computational complexity. We demonstrate our method in the unsupervised optical flow task. Replacing the L1 smoothness constraint with our unrolled cost during the training of a well known baseline, we report improved results on both MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 unsupervised optical flow benchmarks. Particularly, we report EPE reduced by up to 15.82% on occluded pixels, where the smoothness constraint is dominant, enabling the detection of much sharper motion edges.</description>

      <title>Inferring Manifolds From Noisy Data Using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.07478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In analyzing complex datasets, it is often of interest to infer lower dimensional structure underlying the higher dimensional observations. As a flexible class of nonlinear structures, it is common to focus on Riemannian manifolds. Most existing manifold learning algorithms replace the original data with lower dimensional coordinates without providing an estimate of the manifold in the observation space or using the manifold to denoise the original data. This article proposes a new methodology for addressing these problems, allowing interpolation of the estimated manifold between fitted data points. The proposed approach is motivated by novel theoretical properties of local covariance matrices constructed from noisy samples on a manifold. Our results enable us to turn a global manifold reconstruction problem into a local regression problem, allowing application of Gaussian processes for probabilistic manifold reconstruction. In addition to theory justifying the algorithm, we provide simulated and real data examples to illustrate the performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13398v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of omitted variable bias for a wide range of common causal parameters, including (but not limited to) averages of potential outcomes, average treatment effects, average causal derivatives, and policy effects from covariate shifts. Our theory applies to nonparametric models, while naturally allowing for (semi-)parametric restrictions (such as partial linearity) when such assumptions are made. We show how simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables are sufficient to bound the magnitude of the bias, thus facilitating sensitivity analysis in otherwise complex, nonlinear models. Finally, we provide flexible and efficient statistical inference methods for the bounds, which can leverage modern machine learning algorithms for estimation. These results allow empirical researchers to perform sensitivity analyses in a flexible class of machine-learned causal models using very simple, and interpretable, tools. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two empirical examples.</description>

      <title>P-split formulations: A class of intermediate formulations between big-M and convex hull for disjunctive constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of mixed-integer formulations for disjunctive constraints intermediate to the big-M and convex hull formulations in terms of relaxation strength. The main idea is to capture the best of both the big-M and convex hull formulations: a computationally light formulation with a tight relaxation. The "P-split" formulations are based on a lifted transformation that splits convex additively separable constraints into P partitions and forms the convex hull of the linearized and partitioned disjunction. The "P-split" formulations are derived for disjunctive constraints with convex constraints within each disjuct, and we generalize the results for the case with nonconvex constraints within the disjuncts. We analyze the continuous relaxation of the P-split formulations and show that, under certain assumptions, the formulations form a hierarchy starting from a big-M equivalent and converging to the convex hull. The goal of the P-split formulations is to form strong approximations of the convex hull through a computationally simpler formulation. We computationally compare the P-split formulations against big-M and convex hull formulations on 344 test instances. The test problems include K-means clustering, semi-supervised clustering, P_ball problems, and optimization over trained ReLU neural networks. The computational results show promising potential of the P-split formulations. For many of the test problems, P-split formulations are solved with a similar number of explored nodes as the convex hull formulation, while reducing the solution time by an order of magnitude and outperforming big-M both in time and number of explored nodes.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in many complex decision-making tasks. However, safety concerns are raised during deploying RL in real-world applications, leading to a growing demand for safe RL algorithms, such as in autonomous driving and robotics scenarios. While safe control has a long history, the study of safe RL algorithms is still in the early stages. To establish a good foundation for future safe RL research, in this paper, we provide a review of safe RL from the perspectives of methods, theories, and applications. Firstly, we review the progress of safe RL from five dimensions and come up with five crucial problems for safe RL being deployed in real-world applications, coined as "2H3W". Secondly, we analyze the algorithm and theory progress from the perspectives of answering the "2H3W" problems. Particularly, the sample complexity of safe RL algorithms is reviewed and discussed, followed by an introduction to the applications and benchmarks of safe RL algorithms. Finally, we open the discussion of the challenging problems in safe RL, hoping to inspire future research on this thread. To advance the study of safe RL algorithms, we release an open-sourced repository containing the implementations of major safe RL algorithms at the link: https://github.com/chauncygu/Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-Baselines.git.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Approaches for the Orienteering Problem with Stochastic and Dynamic Release Dates</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a sequential decision-making problem faced by e-commerce carriers related to when to send out a vehicle from the central depot to serve customer requests, and in which order to provide the service, under the assumption that the time at which parcels arrive at the depot is stochastic and dynamic. The objective is to maximize the expected number of parcels that can be delivered during service hours. We propose two reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for solving this problem. These approaches rely on a look-ahead strategy in which future release dates are sampled in a Monte-Carlo fashion and a batch approach is used to approximate future routes. Both RL approaches are based on value function approximation - one combines it with a consensus function (VFA-CF) and the other one with a two-stage stochastic integer linear programming model (VFA-2S). VFA-CF and VFA-2S do not need extensive training as they are based on very few hyper-parameters and make good use of integer linear programming (ILP) and branch-and-cut-based exact methods to improve the quality of decisions. We also establish sufficient conditions for partial characterization of optimal policy and integrate them into VFA-CF/VFA-2S. In an empirical study, we conduct a competitive analysis using upper bounds with perfect information. We also show that VFA-CF and VFA-2S greatly outperform alternative approaches that: 1) do not rely on future information, or 2) are based on point estimation of future information, or 3) employ heuristics rather than exact methods, or 4) use exact evaluations of future rewards.</description>

      <title>LLMEffiChecker: Understanding and Testing Efficiency Degradation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make the first attempt to understand and test potential computation efficiency robustness in state-of-the-art LLMs. By analyzing the working mechanism and implementation of 20,543 public-accessible LLMs, we observe a fundamental property in LLMs that could be manipulated in an adversarial manner to reduce computation efficiency significantly. Our key motivation is to generate test inputs that could sufficiently delay the generation of EOS such that LLMs would have to go through enough iterations to satisfy the pre-configured threshold. We present \tool, which can work under both white-box setting and black-box setting. In the white-box scenario, \tool develops a gradient-guided technique that searches for a minimal and unnoticeable perturbation at character-level, token-level, and structure-level. In the black-box scenario, \tool employs a causal inference-based approach to find critical tokens and similarly applies three levels of imperceptible perturbation to them. Both the white-box and black-box settings effectively delay the appearance of EOS, compelling these inputs to reach the naturally-unreachable threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \tool, we conduct a systematic evaluation on nine public-available LLMs: Google T5, AllenAI WMT14, Helsinki-NLP translator, Facebook FairSeq, UNICAMP-DL translator, MarianMT, Google FLAN-T5, MBZUAI LaMini-GPT and Salesforce CodeGen. Experimental results show that \tool can increase on average LLMs' response latency and energy consumption by 325\% to 3244\% and 344\% to 3616\%, respectively, by perturbing just one character or token in the input sentence.</description>

      <title>Why is parameter averaging beneficial in SGD? An objective smoothing perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often observed that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants implicitly select a solution with good generalization performance; such implicit bias is often characterized in terms of the sharpness of the minima. Kleinberg et al. (2018) connected this bias with the smoothing effect of SGD which eliminates sharp local minima by the convolution using the stochastic gradient noise. We follow this line of research and study the commonly-used averaged SGD algorithm, which has been empirically observed in Izmailov et al. (2018) to prefer a flat minimum and therefore achieves better generalization. We prove that in certain problem settings, averaged SGD can efficiently optimize the smoothed objective which avoids sharp local minima. In experiments, we verify our theory and show that parameter averaging with an appropriate step size indeed leads to significant improvement in the performance of SGD.</description>

      <title>Speck: A Smart event-based Vision Sensor with a low latency 327K Neuron Convolutional Neuronal Network Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge computing solutions that enable the extraction of high-level information from a variety of sensors is in increasingly high demand. This is due to the increasing number of smart devices that require sensory processing for their application on the edge. To tackle this problem, we present a smart vision sensor System on Chip (SoC), featuring an event-based camera and a low-power asynchronous spiking Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN) computing architecture embedded on a single chip. By combining both sensor and processing on a single die, we can lower unit production costs significantly. Moreover, the simple end-to-end nature of the SoC facilitates small stand-alone applications as well as functioning as an edge node in larger systems. The event-driven nature of the vision sensor delivers high-speed signals in a sparse data stream. This is reflected in the processing pipeline, which focuses on optimising highly sparse computation and minimising latency for 9 sCNN layers to 3.36{\mu}s for an incoming event. Overall, this results in an extremely low-latency visual processing pipeline deployed on a small form factor with a low energy budget and sensor cost. We present the asynchronous architecture, the individual blocks, and the sCNN processing principle and benchmark against other sCNN capable processors.</description>

      <title>Neural networks for geospatial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of geospatial data has traditionally been model-based, with a mean model, customarily specified as a linear regression on the covariates, and a covariance model, encoding the spatial dependence. We relax the strong assumption of linearity and propose embedding neural networks directly within the traditional geostatistical models to accommodate non-linear mean functions while retaining all other advantages including use of Gaussian Processes to explicitly model the spatial covariance, enabling inference on the covariate effect through the mean and on the spatial dependence through the covariance, and offering predictions at new locations via kriging. We propose NN-GLS, a new neural network estimation algorithm for the non-linear mean in GP models that explicitly accounts for the spatial covariance through generalized least squares (GLS), the same loss used in the linear case. We show that NN-GLS admits a representation as a special type of graph neural network (GNN). This connection facilitates use of standard neural network computational techniques for irregular geospatial data, enabling novel and scalable mini-batching, backpropagation, and kriging schemes. Theoretically, we show that NN-GLS will be consistent for irregularly observed spatially correlated data processes. We also provide a finite sample concentration rate, which quantifies the need to accurately model the spatial covariance in neural networks for dependent data. To our knowledge, these are the first large-sample results for any neural network algorithm for irregular spatial data. We demonstrate the methodology through simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Continual Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current Multimodal Knowledge Graph Construction (MKGC) models struggle with the real-world dynamism of continuously emerging entities and relations, often succumbing to catastrophic forgetting-loss of previously acquired knowledge. This study introduces benchmarks aimed at fostering the development of the continual MKGC domain. We further introduce MSPT framework, designed to surmount the shortcomings of existing MKGC approaches during multimedia data processing. MSPT harmonizes the retention of learned knowledge (stability) and the integration of new data (plasticity), outperforming current continual learning and multimodal methods. Our results confirm MSPT's superior performance in evolving knowledge environments, showcasing its capacity to navigate balance between stability and plasticity.</description>

      <title>Sketch-and-Project Meets Newton Method: Global $\mathcal O(k^{-2})$ Convergence with Low-Rank Updates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first sketch-and-project Newton method with fast $\mathcal O(k^{-2})$ global convergence rate for self-concordant functions. Our method, SGN, can be viewed in three ways: i) as a sketch-and-project algorithm projecting updates of Newton method, ii) as a cubically regularized Newton ethod in sketched subspaces, and iii) as a damped Newton method in sketched subspaces. SGN inherits best of all three worlds: cheap iteration costs of sketch-and-project methods, state-of-the-art $\mathcal O(k^{-2})$ global convergence rate of full-rank Newton-like methods and the algorithm simplicity of damped Newton methods. Finally, we demonstrate its comparable empirical performance to baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>MixCE: Training Autoregressive Language Models by Mixing Forward and Reverse Cross-Entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autoregressive language models are trained by minimizing the cross-entropy of the model distribution Q relative to the data distribution P -- that is, minimizing the forward cross-entropy, which is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We have observed that models trained in this way may "over-generalize", in the sense that they produce non-human-like text. Moreover, we believe that reverse cross-entropy, i.e., the cross-entropy of P relative to Q, is a better reflection of how a human would evaluate text generated by a model. Hence, we propose learning with MixCE, an objective that mixes the forward and reverse cross-entropies. We evaluate models trained with this objective on synthetic data settings (where P is known) and real data, and show that the resulting models yield better generated text without complex decoding strategies. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bloomberg/mixce-acl2023</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution microscopy, or nanoscopy, enables the use of fluorescent-based molecular localization tools to study molecular structure at the nanoscale level in the intact cell, bridging the mesoscale gap to classical structural biology methodologies. Analysis of super-resolution data by artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning, offers tremendous potential for discovery of new biology, that, by definition, is not known and lacks ground truth. Herein, we describe the application of weakly supervised paradigms to super-resolution microscopy and its potential to enable the accelerated exploration of the nanoscale architecture of subcellular macromolecules and organelles.</description>

      <title>MADiff: Offline Multi-agent Learning with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion model (DM) recently achieved huge success in various scenarios including offline reinforcement learning, where the diffusion planner learn to generate desired trajectories during online evaluations. However, despite the effectiveness in single-agent learning, it remains unclear how DMs can operate in multi-agent problems, where agents can hardly complete teamwork without good coordination by independently modeling each agent's trajectories. In this paper, we propose MADiff, a novel generative multi-agent learning framework to tackle this problem. MADiff is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To the best of our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, which behaves as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments show the superior performance of MADiff compared to baseline algorithms in a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks, which emphasizes the effectiveness of MADiff in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

      <title>Learning to solve Bayesian inverse problems: An amortized variational inference approach using Gaussian and Flow guides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems, i.e., estimating parameters of physical models from experimental data, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. The Bayesian formulation is the gold standard because it alleviates ill-posedness issues and quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Since analytical posteriors are not typically available, one resorts to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or approximate variational inference. However, inference needs to be rerun from scratch for each new set of data. This drawback limits the applicability of the Bayesian formulation to real-time settings, e.g., health monitoring of engineered systems, and medical diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology that enables real-time inference by learning the Bayesian inverse map, i.e., the map from data to posteriors. Our approach is as follows. We parameterize the posterior distribution as a function of data. This work outlines two distinct approaches to do this. The first method involves parameterizing the posterior using an amortized full-rank Gaussian guide, implemented through neural networks. The second method utilizes a Conditional Normalizing Flow guide, employing conditional invertible neural networks for cases where the target posterior is arbitrarily complex. In both approaches, we learn the network parameters by amortized variational inference which involves maximizing the expectation of evidence lower bound over all possible datasets compatible with the model. We demonstrate our approach by solving a set of benchmark problems from science and engineering. Our results show that the posterior estimates of our approach are in agreement with the corresponding ground truth obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo. Once trained, our approach provides the posterior distribution for a given observation just at the cost of a forward pass of the neural network.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Item and User Fairness in Multi-Sided Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's online platforms heavily lean on algorithmic recommendations for bolstering user engagement and driving revenue. However, these recommendations can impact multiple stakeholders simultaneously -- the platform, items (sellers), and users (customers) -- each with their unique objectives, making it difficult to find the right middle ground that accommodates all stakeholders. To address this, we introduce a novel fair recommendation framework, Problem (FAIR), that flexibly balances multi-stakeholder interests via a constrained optimization formulation. We next explore Problem (FAIR) in a dynamic online setting where data uncertainty further adds complexity, and propose a low-regret algorithm FORM that concurrently performs real-time learning and fair recommendations, two tasks that are often at odds. Via both theoretical analysis and a numerical case study on real-world data, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and method in maintaining platform revenue while ensuring desired levels of fairness for both items and users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identification and analysis of symmetrical patterns in the natural world have led to significant discoveries across various scientific fields, such as the formulation of gravitational laws in physics and advancements in the study of chemical structures. In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.

      <title>IPA: Inference Pipeline Adaptation to Achieve High Accuracy and Cost-Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently optimizing multi-model inference pipelines for fast, accurate, and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in machine learning production systems, given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the exploration of the vast and intricate trade-off space of latency, accuracy, and cost in inference pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the challenge lies in reconciling latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs. To address this challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep learning Inference Pipeline Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency, and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency Service Level Agreements (SLAs) using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns. Navigating a wider variety of configurations allows \namex{} to achieve better trade-offs between cost and accuracy objectives compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments in a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves end-to-end accuracy by up to 21% with a minimal cost increase. The code and data for replications are available at https://github.com/reconfigurable-ml-pipeline/ipa.</description>

      <title>The Reversal Curse: LLMs trained on "A is B" fail to learn "B is A"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to travel to space", it will not automatically be able to answer the question, "Who was the first woman to travel to space?". Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer ("Valentina Tershkova") will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set: if "A is B" occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur. It is worth noting, however, that if "A is B" appears in-context, models can deduce the reverse relationship. We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of Abyssal Melodies" and showing that they fail to correctly answer "Who composed Abyssal Melodies?". The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter.

Abstract: Robots need to have a memory of previously observed, but currently occluded objects to work reliably in realistic environments. We investigate the problem of encoding object-oriented memory into a multi-object manipulation reasoning and planning framework. We propose DOOM and LOOM, which leverage transformer relational dynamics to encode the history of trajectories given partial-view point clouds and an object discovery and tracking engine. Our approaches can perform multiple challenging tasks including reasoning with occluded objects, novel objects appearance, and object reappearance. Throughout our extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we find that our approaches perform well in terms of different numbers of objects and different numbers of distractor actions. Furthermore, we show our approaches outperform an implicit memory baseline.</description>

      <title>Sharp Generalization of Transductive Learning: A Transductive Local Rademacher Complexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new tool, Transductive Local Complexity (TLC), designed to analyze the generalization performance of transductive learning methods and inspire the development of new algorithms in this domain. Our work extends the concept of the popular Local Rademacher Complexity (LRC) to the transductive setting, incorporating significant and novel modifications compared to the typical analysis of LRC methods in the inductive setting. While LRC has been widely used as a powerful tool for analyzing inductive models, providing sharp generalization bounds for classification and minimax rates for nonparametric regression, it remains an open question whether a localized Rademacher complexity-based tool can be developed for transductive learning. Our goal is to achieve sharp bounds for transductive learning that align with the inductive excess risk bounds established by LRC. We provide a definitive answer to this open problem with the introduction of TLC. We construct TLC by first establishing a novel and sharp concentration inequality for the supremum of a test-train empirical processes. Using a peeling strategy and a new surrogate variance operator, we derive the a novel excess risk bound in the transductive setting which is consistent with the classical LRC-based excess risk bound in the inductive setting. As an application of TLC, we employ this new tool to analyze the Transductive Kernel Learning (TKL) model, deriving sharper excess risk bounds than those provided by the current state-of-the-art under the same assumptions. Additionally, the concentration inequality for the test-train process is employed to derive a sharp concentration inequality for the general supremum of empirical processes involving random variables in the setting of uniform sampling without replacement. The sharpness of our derived bound is compared to existing concentration inequalities under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Controlling Continuous Relaxation for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning (UL)-based solvers for combinatorial optimization (CO) train a neural network whose output provides a soft solution by directly optimizing the CO objective using a continuous relaxation strategy. These solvers offer several advantages over traditional methods and other learning-based methods, particularly for large-scale CO problems. However, UL-based solvers face two practical issues: (I) an optimization issue where UL-based solvers are easily trapped at local optima, and (II) a rounding issue where UL-based solvers require artificial post-learning rounding from the continuous space back to the original discrete space, undermining the robustness of the results. This study proposes a Continuous Relaxation Annealing (CRA) strategy, an effective rounding-free learning method for UL-based solvers. CRA introduces a penalty term that dynamically shifts from prioritizing continuous solutions, effectively smoothing the non-convexity of the objective function, to enforcing discreteness, eliminating the artificial rounding. Experimental results demonstrate that CRA significantly enhances the performance of UL-based solvers, outperforming existing UL-based solvers and greedy algorithms in complex CO problems. It also effectively eliminates the artificial rounding and accelerates the learning.</description>

      <title>Pre-training with Synthetic Data Helps Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that for offline deep reinforcement learning (DRL), pre-training Decision Transformer with a large language corpus can improve downstream performance (Reid et al., 2022). A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic IID data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), a popular offline DRL algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) backbone. Surprisingly, pre-training with simple synthetic data for a small number of updates can also improve CQL, providing consistent performance improvement on D4RL Gym locomotion datasets. The results of this paper not only illustrate the importance of pre-training for offline DRL but also show that the pre-training data can be synthetic and generated with remarkably simple mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents: A Social Psychology View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique `societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific `trait' (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct `thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches, but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest human-like social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We commit to sharing our code and datasets\footnote{\url{https://github.com/zjunlp/MachineSoM}.}, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.</description>

      <title>Distantly-Supervised Joint Extraction with Noise-Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint entity and relation extraction is a process that identifies entity pairs and their relations using a single model. We focus on the problem of joint extraction in distantly-labeled data, whose labels are generated by aligning entity mentions with the corresponding entity and relation tags using a knowledge base (KB). One key challenge is the presence of noisy labels arising from both incorrect entity and relation annotations, which significantly impairs the quality of supervised learning. Existing approaches, either considering only one source of noise or making decisions using external knowledge, cannot well-utilize significant information in the training data. We propose DENRL, a generalizable framework that 1) incorporates a lightweight transformer backbone into a sequence labeling scheme for joint tagging, and 2) employs a noise-robust framework that regularizes the tagging model with significant relation patterns and entity-relation dependencies, then iteratively self-adapts to instances with less noise from both sources. Surprisingly, experiments on two benchmark datasets show that DENRL, using merely its own parametric distribution and simple data-driven heuristics, outperforms large language model-based baselines by a large margin with better interpretability.</description>

      <title>FactCHD: Benchmarking Fact-Conflicting Hallucination Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, LLMs are hindered by fact-conflicting hallucinations in real-world applications. The accurate identification of hallucinations in texts generated by LLMs, especially in complex inferential scenarios, is a relatively unexplored area. To address this gap, we present FactCHD, a dedicated benchmark designed for the detection of fact-conflicting hallucinations from LLMs. FactCHD features a diverse dataset that spans various factuality patterns, including vanilla, multi-hop, comparison, and set operation. A distinctive element of FactCHD is its integration of fact-based evidence chains, significantly enhancing the depth of evaluating the detectors' explanations. Experiments on different LLMs expose the shortcomings of current approaches in detecting factual errors accurately. Furthermore, we introduce Truth-Triangulator that synthesizes reflective considerations by tool-enhanced ChatGPT and LoRA-tuning based on Llama2, aiming to yield more credible detection through the amalgamation of predictive results and evidence. The benchmark dataset is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/FactCHD.</description>

      <title>An Image is Worth Multiple Words: Discovering Object Level Concepts using Multi-Concept Prompt Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textural Inversion, a prompt learning method, learns a singular text embedding for a new "word" to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be integrated into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised images. However, identifying multiple unknown object-level concepts within one scene remains a complex challenge. While recent methods have resorted to cropping or masking individual images to learn multiple concepts, these techniques often require prior knowledge of new concepts and are labour-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL), where multiple unknown "words" are simultaneously learned from a single sentence-image pair, without any imagery annotations. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept correlation and refine attention mask boundaries, we propose three regularisation techniques: Attention Masking, Prompts Contrastive Loss, and Bind Adjective. Extensive quantitative comparisons with both real-world categories and biomedical images demonstrate that our method can learn new semantically disentangled concepts. Our approach emphasises learning solely from textual embeddings, using less than 10% of the storage space compared to others. The project page, code, and data are available at https://astrazeneca.github.io/mcpl.github.io.</description>

      <title>FLTrojan: Privacy Leakage Attacks against Federated Language Models Through Selective Weight Tampering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become a key component in various language modeling applications such as machine translation, next-word prediction, and medical record analysis. These applications are trained on datasets from many FL participants that often include privacy-sensitive data, such as healthcare records, phone/credit card numbers, login credentials, etc. Although FL enables computation without necessitating clients to share their raw data, determining the extent of privacy leakage in federated language models is challenging and not straightforward. Moreover, existing attacks aim to extract data regardless of how sensitive or naive it is. To fill this research gap, we introduce two novel findings with regard to leaking privacy-sensitive user data from federated large language models. Firstly, we make a key observation that model snapshots from the intermediate rounds in FL can cause greater privacy leakage than the final trained model. Secondly, we identify that privacy leakage can be aggravated by tampering with a model's selective weights that are specifically responsible for memorizing the sensitive training data. We show how a malicious client can leak the privacy-sensitive data of some other users in FL even without any cooperation from the server. Our best-performing method improves the membership inference recall by 29% and achieves up to 71% private data reconstruction, evidently outperforming existing attacks with stronger assumptions of adversary capabilities.</description>

      <title>SQLformer: Deep Auto-Regressive Query Graph Generation for Text-to-SQL Translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18376v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the task of text-to-SQL translation, which converts natural language questions into executable SQL queries, has gained significant attention for its potential to democratize data access. Despite its promise, challenges such as adapting to unseen databases and aligning natural language with SQL syntax have hindered widespread adoption. To overcome these issues, we introduce SQLformer, a novel Transformer architecture specifically crafted to perform text-to-SQL translation tasks. Our model predicts SQL queries as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in an autoregressive way, incorporating structural inductive bias in the encoder and decoder layers. This bias, guided by database table and column selection, aids the decoder in generating SQL query ASTs represented as graphs in a Breadth-First Search canonical order. Our experiments demonstrate that SQLformer achieves state-of-the-art performance across six prominent text-to-SQL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Intermediate Layers design in Knowledge Distillation for Kidney and Liver Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, but its application to medical imaging tasks, such as kidney and liver tumor segmentation, has encountered challenges. Many existing KD methods are not specifically tailored for these tasks. Moreover, prevalent KD methods often lack a careful consideration of `what' and `from where' to distill knowledge from the teacher to the student. This oversight may lead to issues like the accumulation of training bias within shallower student layers, potentially compromising the effectiveness of KD. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Layer-selective Feedback Distillation (HLFD). HLFD strategically distills knowledge from a combination of middle layers to earlier layers and transfers final layer knowledge to intermediate layers at both the feature and pixel levels. This design allows the model to learn higher-quality representations from earlier layers, resulting in a robust and compact student model. Extensive quantitative evaluations reveal that HLFD outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. For example, in the kidney segmentation task, HLFD surpasses the student model (without KD) by over 10\%, significantly improving its focus on tumor-specific features. From a qualitative standpoint, the student model trained using HLFD excels at suppressing irrelevant information and can focus sharply on tumor-specific details, which opens a new pathway for more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools.

      <title>Self-Infilling Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces self-infilling code generation, a general framework that incorporates infilling operations into auto-regressive decoding. Our approach capitalizes on the observation that recent infilling-capable code language models can self-infill: whereas infilling operations aim to fill in the middle based on a predefined prefix and suffix, self-infilling sequentially generates both such surrounding context and the infilled content. We utilize this capability to introduce novel interruption and looping mechanisms in conventional decoding, evolving it into a non-monotonic process. Interruptions allow for postponing the generation of specific code until a definitive suffix is established, enhancing control over the output. Meanwhile, the looping mechanism, which leverages the complementary nature of self-infilling and left-to-right decoding, can iteratively update and synchronize each piece of generation cyclically. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed decoding process is effective in enhancing both regularity and quality across several code generation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Vulnerabilities of Contrastive Recommender Systems to Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has recently gained prominence in the domain of recommender systems due to its great ability to enhance recommendation accuracy and improve model robustness. Despite its advantages, this paper identifies a vulnerability of CL-based recommender systems that they are more susceptible to poisoning attacks aiming to promote individual items. Our analysis indicates that this vulnerability is attributed to the uniform spread of representations caused by the InfoNCE loss. Furthermore, theoretical and empirical evidence shows that optimizing this loss favors smooth spectral values of representations. This finding suggests that attackers could facilitate this optimization process of CL by encouraging a more uniform distribution of spectral values, thereby enhancing the degree of representation dispersion. With these insights, we attempt to reveal a potential poisoning attack against CL-based recommender systems, which encompasses a dual-objective framework: one that induces a smoother spectral value distribution to amplify the InfoNCE loss's inherent dispersion effect, named dispersion promotion; and the other that directly elevates the visibility of target items, named rank promotion. We validate the threats of our attack model through extensive experimentation on four datasets. By shedding light on these vulnerabilities, our goal is to advance the development of more robust CL-based recommender systems. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/CoderWZW/ARLib}.</description>

      <title>DiffusionSat: A Generative Foundation Model for Satellite Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results on many modalities including images, speech, and video. However, existing models are not tailored to support remote sensing data, which is widely used in important applications including environmental monitoring and crop-yield prediction. Satellite images are significantly different from natural images -- they can be multi-spectral, irregularly sampled across time -- and existing diffusion models trained on images from the Web do not support them. Furthermore, remote sensing data is inherently spatio-temporal, requiring conditional generation tasks not supported by traditional methods based on captions or images. In this paper, we present DiffusionSat, to date the largest generative foundation model trained on a collection of publicly available large, high-resolution remote sensing datasets. As text-based captions are sparsely available for satellite images, we incorporate the associated metadata such as geolocation as conditioning information. Our method produces realistic samples and can be used to solve multiple generative tasks including temporal generation, superresolution given multi-spectral inputs and in-painting. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for satellite image generation and is the first large-scale generative foundation model for satellite imagery.

      <title>Dynamics Harmonic Analysis of Robotic Systems: Application in Data-Driven Koopman Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the use of harmonic analysis to decompose the state space of symmetric robotic systems into orthogonal isotypic subspaces. These are lower-dimensional spaces that capture distinct, symmetric, and synergistic motions. For linear dynamics, we characterize how this decomposition leads to a subdivision of the dynamics into independent linear systems on each subspace, a property we term dynamics harmonic analysis (DHA). To exploit this property, we use Koopman operator theory to propose an equivariant deep-learning architecture that leverages the properties of DHA to learn a global linear model of the system dynamics. Our architecture, validated on synthetic systems and the dynamics of locomotion of a quadrupedal robot, exhibits enhanced generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability, with fewer trainable parameters and computational costs.</description>

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) has been a long-standing problem in both vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. In recent years, as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various NLP downstream tasks, utilizing PLMs as backbones has become a common practice in recent research of IL in NLP. Most assume that catastrophic forgetting is the biggest obstacle to achieving superior IL performance and propose various techniques to overcome this issue. However, we find that this assumption is problematic. Specifically, we revisit more than 20 methods on four classification tasks (Text Classification, Intent Classification, Relation Extraction, and Named Entity Recognition) under the two most popular IL settings (Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental) and reveal that most of them severely underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting ability of PLMs. Based on the observation, we propose a frustratingly easy method called SEQ* for IL with PLMs. The results show that SEQ* has competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods and requires considerably less trainable parameters and training time. These findings urge us to revisit the IL with PLMs and encourage future studies to have a fundamental understanding of the catastrophic forgetting in PLMs. The data, code and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.</description>

      <title>Generalized Category Discovery with Large Language Models in the Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is a crucial task that aims to recognize both known and novel categories from a set of unlabeled data by utilizing a few labeled data with only known categories. Due to the lack of supervision and category information, current methods usually perform poorly on novel categories and struggle to reveal semantic meanings of the discovered clusters, which limits their applications in the real world. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Loop, an end-to-end active-learning framework that introduces Large Language Models (LLMs) into the training loop, which can boost model performance and generate category names without relying on any human efforts. Specifically, we first propose Local Inconsistent Sampling (LIS) to select samples that have a higher probability of falling to wrong clusters, based on neighborhood prediction consistency and entropy of cluster assignment probabilities. Then we propose a Scalable Query strategy to allow LLMs to choose true neighbors of the selected samples from multiple candidate samples. Based on the feedback from LLMs, we perform Refined Neighborhood Contrastive Learning (RNCL) to pull samples and their neighbors closer to learn clustering-friendly representations. Finally, we select representative samples from clusters corresponding to novel categories to allow LLMs to generate category names for them. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that Loop outperforms SOTA models by a large margin and generates accurate category names for the discovered clusters. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Lackel/LOOP.</description>

Abstract: In the modern world, the amount of visual data recorded has been rapidly increasing. In many cases, data is stored in geographically distinct locations and thus requires a large amount of time and space to consolidate. Sometimes, there are also regulations for privacy protection which prevent data consolidation. In this work, we present federated implementations for object detection and recognition using a federated Faster R-CNN (FRCNN) and image segmentation using a federated Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). Our FRCNN was trained on 5000 examples of the COCO2017 dataset while our FCN was trained on the entire train set of the CamVid dataset. The proposed federated models address the challenges posed by the increasing volume and decentralized nature of visual data, offering efficient solutions in compliance with privacy regulations.</description>

      <title>The Art of Deception: Robust Backdoor Attack using Dynamic Stacking of Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is experiencing increased implementation due to recent advancements in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) industry. However, this spike has prompted concerns regarding AI defense mechanisms, specifically regarding potential covert attacks from third-party providers that cannot be entirely trusted. Recent research has uncovered that auditory backdoors may use certain modifications as their initiating mechanism. DynamicTrigger is introduced as a methodology for carrying out dynamic backdoor attacks that use cleverly designed tweaks to ensure that corrupted samples are indistinguishable from clean. By utilizing fluctuating signal sampling rates and masking speaker identities through dynamic sound triggers (such as the clapping of hands), it is possible to deceive speech recognition systems (ASR). Our empirical testing demonstrates that DynamicTrigger is both potent and stealthy, achieving impressive success rates during covert attacks while maintaining exceptional accuracy with non-poisoned datasets.</description>

      <title>AutoAct: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex question-answering tasks by planning with external tools. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by AutoAct generally outperforming that of others. Code will be available at https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct.</description>

      <title>Generating Likely Counterfactuals Using Sum-Product Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainability of decisions made by AI systems is driven by both recent regulation and user demand. These decisions are often explainable only \emph{post hoc}, after the fact. In counterfactual explanations, one may ask what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation. Clearly, multiple criteria must be taken into account, although "distance from the sample" is a key criterion. Recent methods that consider the plausibility of a counterfactual seem to sacrifice this original objective. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations that are, at the same time, close and sparse. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using mixed-integer optimization (MIO). In the process, we propose an MIO formulation of a Sum-Product Network (SPN) and use the SPN to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16184v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the latent space of language models (LMs) is important for improving the performance and interpretability of LMs. Existing analyses often fail to provide insights that take advantage of the semantic properties of language models and often overlook crucial aspects of language model adaptation. In response, we introduce a pioneering approach called vocabulary-defined semantics, which establishes a reference frame grounded in LM vocabulary within the LM latent space. We propose a novel technique to compute disentangled logits and gradients in latent space, not entangled ones on vocabulary. Further, we perform semantical clustering on data representations as a novel way of LM adaptation. Through extensive experiments across diverse text understanding datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods of retrieval-augmented generation and parameter-efficient finetuning, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discovery of PDEs via the Adjoint Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an adjoint-based method for discovering the underlying governing partial differential equations (PDEs) given data. The idea is to consider a parameterized PDE in a general form and formulate a PDE-constrained optimization problem aimed at minimizing the error of the PDE solution from data. Using variational calculus, we obtain an evolution equation for the Lagrange multipliers (adjoint equations) allowing us to compute the gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters of PDEs given data in a straightforward manner. In particular, we consider a family of parameterized PDEs encompassing linear, nonlinear, and spatial derivative candidate terms, and elegantly derive the corresponding adjoint equations. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach in identifying the form of the PDE up to machine accuracy, enabling the accurate discovery of PDEs from data. We also compare its performance with the famous PDE Functional Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics method known as PDE-FIND (Rudy et al., 2017), on both smooth and noisy data sets. Even though the proposed adjoint method relies on forward/backward solvers, it outperforms PDE-FIND for large data sets thanks to the analytic expressions for gradients of the cost function with respect to each PDE parameter.</description>

      <title>Continuous Tensor Relaxation for Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the best solution is a common objective in combinatorial optimization (CO). In practice, directly handling constraints is often challenging, incorporating them into the objective function as the penalties. However, balancing these penalties to achieve the desired solution is time-consuming. Additionally, formulated objective functions and constraints often only approximate real-world scenarios, where the optimal solution is not necessarily the best solution for the original real-world problem. One solution is to obtain (i) penalty-diversified solutions with varying penalty strengths for the former issue and (ii) variation-diversified solutions with different characteristics for the latter issue. Users can then post-select the desired solution from these diverse solutions. However, efficiently finding these diverse solutions is more difficult than identifying one. This study introduces Continual Tensor Relaxation Annealing (CTRA) for unsupervised-learning (UL)-based CO solvers, a computationally efficient framework for finding these diverse solutions in a single training run. The key idea is to leverage representation learning capability to automatically and efficiently learn common representations and parallelization. Numerical experiments show that CTRA enables UL-based solvers to find these diverse solutions much faster than repeatedly running existing UL-based solvers.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Power of Prompt for Visual Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual prompt tuning (VPT) is a promising solution incorporating learnable prompt tokens to customize pre-trained models for downstream tasks. However, VPT and its variants often encounter challenges like prompt initialization, prompt length, and subpar performance in self-supervised pretraining, hindering successful contextual adaptation. This study commences by exploring the correlation evolvement between prompts and patch tokens during proficient training. Inspired by the observation that the prompt tokens tend to share high mutual information with patch tokens, we propose initializing prompts with downstream token prototypes. The strategic initialization, a stand-in for the previous initialization, substantially improves performance in fine-tuning. To refine further, we optimize token construction with a streamlined pipeline that maintains excellent performance with almost no increase in computational expenses compared to VPT. Exhaustive experiments show our proposed approach outperforms existing methods by a remarkable margin. For instance, it surpasses full fine-tuning in 19 out of 24 tasks, using less than 0.4% of learnable parameters on the FGVC and VTAB-1K benchmarks. Notably, our method significantly advances the adaptation for self-supervised pretraining, achieving impressive task performance gains of at least 10% to 30%. Besides, the experimental results demonstrate the proposed SPT is robust to prompt lengths and scales well with model capacity and training data size. We finally provide an insightful exploration into the amount of target data facilitating the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks.

      <title>PoCo: Policy Composition from and for Heterogeneous Robot Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training general robotic policies from heterogeneous data for different tasks is a significant challenge. Existing robotic datasets vary in different modalities such as color, depth, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and collected in different domains such as simulation, real robots, and human videos. Current methods usually collect and pool all data from one domain to train a single policy to handle such heterogeneity in tasks and domains, which is prohibitively expensive and difficult. In this work, we present a flexible approach, dubbed Policy Composition, to combine information across such diverse modalities and domains for learning scene-level and task-level generalized manipulation skills, by composing different data distributions represented with diffusion models. Our method can use task-level composition for multi-task manipulation and be composed with analytic cost functions to adapt policy behaviors at inference time. We train our method on simulation, human, and real robot data and evaluate in tool-use tasks. The composed policy achieves robust and dexterous performance under varying scenes and tasks and outperforms baselines from a single data source in both simulation and real-world experiments.

      <title>Estimation of conditional average treatment effects on distributed data: A privacy-preserving approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) is an important topic in sciences. CATEs can be estimated with high accuracy if distributed data across multiple parties can be centralized. However, it is difficult to aggregate such data owing to privacy concerns. To address this issue, we proposed data collaboration double machine learning, a method that can estimate CATE models with privacy preservation of distributed data, and evaluated the method through simulations. Our contributions are summarized in the following three points. First, our method enables estimation and testing of semi-parametric CATE models without iterative communication on distributed data. Semi-parametric CATE models enable estimation and testing that is more robust to model mis-specification than parametric models. Second, our method enables collaborative estimation between multiple time points and different parties. Third, our method performed equally or better than other methods in simulations using synthetic, semi-synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have indeed made a profound impact on various fields, emerging as pivotal components that significantly shape the capabilities of intelligent systems. In the context of intelligent vehicles, leveraging the power of foundation models has proven to be transformative, offering notable advancements in visual understanding. Equipped with multi-modal and multi-task learning capabilities, multi-modal multi-task visual understanding foundation models (MM-VUFMs) effectively process and fuse data from diverse modalities and simultaneously handle various driving-related tasks with powerful adaptability, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the surrounding scene. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of MM-VUFMs specifically designed for road scenes. Our objective is not only to provide a comprehensive overview of common practices, referring to task-specific models, unified multi-modal models, unified multi-task models, and foundation model prompting techniques, but also to highlight their advanced capabilities in diverse learning paradigms. These paradigms include open-world understanding, efficient transfer for road scenes, continual learning, interactive and generative capability. Moreover, we provide insights into key challenges and future trends, such as closed-loop driving systems, interpretability, embodied driving agents, and world models. To facilitate researchers in staying abreast of the latest developments in MM-VUFMs for road scenes, we have established a continuously updated repository at https://github.com/rolsheng/MM-VUFM4DS</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03008v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03190v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Adaptation for Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common to observe performance degradation when transferring models trained on some (source) datasets to target testing data due to a domain gap between them. Existing methods for bridging this gap, such as domain adaptation (DA), may require the source data on which the model was trained (often not available), while others, i.e., source-free DA, require many passes through the testing data. We propose an online test-time adaptation method for depth completion, the task of inferring a dense depth map from a single image and associated sparse depth map, that closes the performance gap in a single pass. We first present a study on how the domain shift in each data modality affects model performance. Based on our observations that the sparse depth modality exhibits a much smaller covariate shift than the image, we design an embedding module trained in the source domain that preserves a mapping from features encoding only sparse depth to those encoding image and sparse depth. During test time, sparse depth features are projected using this map as a proxy for source domain features and are used as guidance to train a set of auxiliary parameters (i.e., adaptation layer) to align image and sparse depth features from the target test domain to that of the source domain. We evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that it improves over baselines by an average of 21.1%.</description>

      <title>Approximation Rates and VC-Dimension Bounds for (P)ReLU MLP Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) can scale up beyond traditional deep learning models by employing a routing strategy in which each input is processed by a single "expert" deep learning model. This strategy allows us to scale up the number of parameters defining the MoE while maintaining sparse activation, i.e., MoEs only load a small number of their total parameters into GPU VRAM for the forward pass depending on the input. In this paper, we provide an approximation and learning-theoretic analysis of mixtures of expert MLPs with (P)ReLU activation functions. We first prove that for every error level $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and every Lipschitz function $f:[0,1]^n\to \mathbb{R}$, one can construct a MoMLP model (a Mixture-of-Experts comprising of (P)ReLU MLPs) which uniformly approximates $f$ to $\varepsilon$ accuracy over $[0,1]^n$, while only requiring networks of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$ parameters to be loaded in memory. Additionally, we show that MoMLPs can generalize since the entire MoMLP model has a (finite) VC dimension of $\tilde{O}(L\max\{nL,JW\})$, if there are $L$ experts and each expert has a depth and width of $J$ and $W$, respectively.</description>

      <title>SCAFFLSA: Taming Heterogeneity in Federated Linear Stochastic Approximation and TD Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the sample and communication complexity of the federated linear stochastic approximation (FedLSA) algorithm. We explicitly quantify the effects of local training with agent heterogeneity. We show that the communication complexity of FedLSA scales polynomially with the inverse of the desired accuracy $\epsilon$. To overcome this, we propose SCAFFLSA a new variant of FedLSA that uses control variates to correct for client drift, and establish its sample and communication complexities. We show that for statistically heterogeneous agents, its communication complexity scales logarithmically with the desired accuracy, similar to Scaffnew. An important finding is that, compared to the existing results for Scaffnew, the sample complexity scales with the inverse of the number of agents, a property referred to as linear speed-up. Achieving this linear speed-up requires completely new theoretical arguments. We apply the proposed method to federated temporal difference learning with linear function approximation and analyze the corresponding complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Sequence and Structure Generation for Realistic Antibody Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibody design plays a pivotal role in advancing therapeutics. Although deep learning has made rapid progress in this field, existing methods jointly generate antibody sequences and structures, limiting task-specific optimization. In response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling (ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and structure prediction. Although our approach is simple, such a decoupling strategy has been overlooked in previous works. We also find that the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote sequences with overly repeating tokens. Such sequences are both out-of-distribution and prone to undesirable developability properties that can trigger harmful immune responses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a composition-based objective that allows an efficient trade-off between high performance and low token repetition. Our results demonstrate that ASSD consistently outperforms existing antibody design models, while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates token repetition of non-autoregressive models. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/lkny123/ASSD_public}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of data discovery in data lakes, focusing on table augmentation for given machine learning tasks. We analyze alternative methods used in the three main steps: retrieving joinable tables, merging information, and predicting with the resultant table. As data lakes, the paper uses YADL (Yet Another Data Lake) -- a novel dataset we developed as a tool for benchmarking this data discovery task -- and Open Data US, a well-referenced real data lake. Through systematic exploration on both lakes, our study outlines the importance of accurately retrieving join candidates and the efficiency of simple merging methods. We report new insights on the benefits of existing solutions and on their limitations, aiming at guiding future research in this space.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Evaluation of Code LLMs with Round-Trip Correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To evaluate code large language models (LLMs), research has relied on a few small manually curated benchmarks, such as HumanEval and MBPP, which represent a narrow part of the real-world software domains. In this work, we introduce round-trip correctness (RTC) as an alternative evaluation method. RTC allows Code LLM evaluation on a broader spectrum of real-world software domains without the need for costly human curation. RTC rests on the idea that we can ask a model to make a prediction (e.g., describe some code using natural language), feed that prediction back (e.g., synthesize code from the predicted description), and check if this round-trip leads to code that is semantically equivalent to the original input. We show how to employ RTC to evaluate code synthesis and editing. We find that RTC strongly correlates with model performance on existing narrow-domain code synthesis benchmarks while allowing us to expand to a much broader set of domains and tasks which was not previously possible without costly human annotations.</description>

      <title>Incremental Sequence Labeling: A Tale of Two Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incremental sequence labeling task involves continuously learning new classes over time while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. Our investigation identifies two significant semantic shifts: E2O (where the model mislabels an old entity as a non-entity) and O2E (where the model labels a non-entity or old entity as a new entity). Previous research has predominantly focused on addressing the E2O problem, neglecting the O2E issue. This negligence results in a model bias towards classifying new data samples as belonging to the new class during the learning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Incremental Sequential Labeling without Semantic Shifts (IS3). Motivated by the identified semantic shifts (E2O and O2E), IS3 aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in models. As for the E2O problem, we use knowledge distillation to maintain the model's discriminative ability for old entities. Simultaneously, to tackle the O2E problem, we alleviate the model's bias towards new entities through debiased loss and optimization levels. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on three datasets with various incremental settings, demonstrates the superior performance of IS3 compared to the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin.The data, code, and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.</description>

      <title>Enabling Weak LLMs to Judge Response Reliability via Meta Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, they still have reliability issues. Previous studies indicate that strong LLMs like GPT-4-turbo excel in evaluating the reliability of responses from LLMs, but face efficiency and local deployment issues. Thus, to enable weak LLMs to effectively assess the reliability of LLM responses, we propose a novel cross-query-comparison-based method called $\textit{Meta Ranking}$ (MR). Unlike previous few-shot methods that solely based on in-context learning capabilities in LLMs, MR assesses reliability by pairwisely ranking the target query-response pair with multiple reference query-response pairs. We found that MR is highly effective in error detection for LLM responses, where weak LLMs, such as Phi-2, could surpass strong baselines like GPT-3.5-turbo, requiring only five reference samples and significantly improving efficiency. We further demonstrate that MR can enhance strong LLMs' performance in two practical applications: model cascading and instruction tuning. In model cascading, we combine open- and closed-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4-turbo with lower costs. In instruction tuning, we use MR for iterative training data filtering, significantly reducing data processing time and enabling LLaMA-7B and Phi-2 to surpass Alpaca-13B with fewer training tokens. These results underscore the high potential of MR in both efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Gaussian Fluctuations of Eigenvectors in Spectral Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of spectral clustering relies on the fluctuations of the entries of the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix, which has been left uncharacterized until now. In this letter, it is shown that the signal $+$ noise structure of a general spike random matrix model is transferred to the eigenvectors of the corresponding Gram kernel matrix and the fluctuations of their entries are Gaussian in the large-dimensional regime. This CLT-like result was the last missing piece to precisely predict the classification performance of spectral clustering. The proposed proof is very general and relies solely on the rotational invariance of the noise. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate the universality of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Instruction-tuned Language Models are Better Knowledge Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pre-instruction-tuning significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Low-Rank and Local Low-Rank Matrix Approximation in Big Data Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large volume and complexity of medical imaging datasets are bottlenecks for storage, transmission, and processing. To tackle these challenges, the application of low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) and its derivative, local LRMA (LLRMA) has demonstrated potential. A detailed analysis of the literature identifies LRMA and LLRMA methods applied to various imaging modalities, and the challenges and limitations associated with existing LRMA and LLRMA methods are addressed. We note a significant shift towards a preference for LLRMA in the medical imaging field since 2015, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in capturing complex structures in medical data compared to LRMA. Acknowledging the limitations of shallow similarity methods used with LLRMA, we suggest advanced semantic image segmentation for similarity measure, explaining in detail how it can be used to measure similar patches and its feasibility. We note that LRMA and LLRMA are mainly applied to unstructured medical data, and we propose extending their application to different medical data types, including structured and semi-structured. This paper also discusses how LRMA and LLRMA can be applied to regular data with missing entries and the impact of inaccuracies in predicting missing values and their effects. We discuss the impact of patch size and propose the use of random search (RS) to determine the optimal patch size. To enhance feasibility, a hybrid approach using Bayesian optimization and RS is proposed, which could improve the application of LRMA and LLRMA in medical imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across various domains; however, they exhibit a significant performance gap in Information Extraction (IE). Note that high-quality instruction data is the vital key for enhancing the specific capabilities of LLMs, while current IE datasets tend to be small in scale, fragmented, and lack standardized schema. To this end, we introduce IEPile, a comprehensive bilingual (English and Chinese) IE instruction corpus, which contains approximately 0.32B tokens. We construct IEPile by collecting and cleaning 33 existing IE datasets, and introduce schema-based instruction generation to unearth a large-scale corpus. Experimentally, IEPile enhance the performance of LLMs for IE, with notable improvements in zero-shot generalization. We open-source the resource and pre-trained models, hoping to provide valuable support to the NLP community.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Language Model (DLM) for Dynamic Restless Multi-Armed Bandit Tasks in Public Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have demonstrated success in optimizing resource allocation for large beneficiary populations in public health settings. Unfortunately, RMAB models lack flexibility to adapt to evolving public health policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept automated planners across domains of robotic control and navigation. In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input.</description>

      <title>tinyBenchmarks: evaluating LLMs with fewer examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The versatility of large language models (LLMs) led to the creation of diverse benchmarks that thoroughly test a variety of language models' abilities. These benchmarks consist of tens of thousands of examples making evaluation of LLMs very expensive. In this paper, we investigate strategies to reduce the number of evaluations needed to assess the performance of an LLM on several key benchmarks. For example, we show that to accurately estimate the performance of an LLM on MMLU, a popular multiple-choice QA benchmark consisting of 14K examples, it is sufficient to evaluate this LLM on 100 curated examples. We release evaluation tools and tiny versions of popular benchmarks: Open LLM Leaderboard, MMLU, HELM, and AlpacaEval 2.0. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that these tools and tiny benchmarks are sufficient to reliably and efficiently reproduce the original evaluation results.</description>

      <title>Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents and effectively address open teams, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the joint Q-value representation from the perspective of cooperative game theory, and validate its learning paradigm in open team settings. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO compatible with GPL framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning. The demo of experiments is available on https://sites.google.com/view/ciao2024, and the code of experiments is published on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/CIAO.</description>

      <title>No Free Lunch in LLM Watermarking: Trade-offs in Watermarking Design Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in generative models have made it possible for AI-generated text, code, and images to mirror human-generated content in many applications. Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems surprisingly susceptible to attack -- leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizing Inferences from Trials to Target Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are pivotal in generating internally valid estimates with minimal assumptions, serving as a cornerstone for researchers dedicated to advancing causal inference methods. However, extending these findings beyond the experimental cohort to achieve externally valid estimates is crucial for broader scientific inquiry. This paper delves into the forefront of addressing these external validity challenges, encapsulating the essence of a multidisciplinary workshop held at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), Brown University, in Fall 2023. The workshop congregated experts from diverse fields including social science, medicine, public health, statistics, computer science, and education, to tackle the unique obstacles each discipline faces in extrapolating experimental findings. Our study presents three key contributions: we integrate ongoing efforts, highlighting methodological synergies across fields; provide an exhaustive review of generalizability and transportability based on the workshop's discourse; and identify persistent hurdles while suggesting avenues for future research. By doing so, this paper aims to enhance the collective understanding of the generalizability and transportability of causal effects, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and offering valuable insights for researchers working on refining and applying causal inference methods.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e. a performance guarantee for DMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RS-DMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.</description>

      <title>Approximations to the Fisher Information Metric of Deep Generative Models for Out-Of-Distribution Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Likelihood-based deep generative models such as score-based diffusion models and variational autoencoders are state-of-the-art machine learning models approximating high-dimensional distributions of data such as images, text, or audio. One of many downstream tasks they can be naturally applied to is out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, seminal work by Nalisnick et al. which we reproduce showed that deep generative models consistently infer higher log-likelihoods for OOD data than data they were trained on, marking an open problem. In this work, we analyse using the gradient of a data point with respect to the parameters of the deep generative model for OOD detection, based on the simple intuition that OOD data should have larger gradient norms than training data. We formalise measuring the size of the gradient as approximating the Fisher information metric. We show that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) has large absolute diagonal values, motivating the use of chi-square distributed, layer-wise gradient norms as features. We combine these features to make a simple, model-agnostic and hyperparameter-free method for OOD detection which estimates the joint density of the layer-wise gradient norms for a given data point. We find that these layer-wise gradient norms are weakly correlated, rendering their combined usage informative, and prove that the layer-wise gradient norms satisfy the principle of (data representation) invariance. Our empirical results indicate that this method outperforms the Typicality test for most deep generative models and image dataset pairings.</description>

      <title>A mechanism-driven reinforcement learning framework for shape optimization of airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel mechanism-driven reinforcement learning framework is proposed for airfoil shape optimization. To validate the framework, a reward function is designed and analyzed, from which the equivalence between the maximizing the cumulative reward and achieving the optimization objectives is guaranteed theoretically. To establish a quality exploration, and to obtain an accurate reward from the environment, an efficient solver for steady Euler equations is employed in the reinforcement learning method. The solver utilizes the B\'ezier curve to describe the shape of the airfoil, and a Newton-geometric multigrid method for the solution. In particular, a dual-weighted residual-based h-adaptive method is used for efficient calculation of target functional. To effectively streamline the airfoil shape during the deformation process, we introduce the Laplacian smoothing, and propose a B\'ezier fitting strategy, which not only remits mesh tangling but also guarantees a precise manipulation of the geometry. In addition, a neural network architecture is designed based on an attention mechanism to make the learning process more sensitive to the minor change of the airfoil geometry. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework can handle the optimization problem with hundreds of design variables. It is worth mentioning that, prior to this work, there are limited works combining such high-fidelity partial differential equatons framework with advanced reinforcement learning algorithms for design problems with such high dimensionality.</description>

      <title>UniTable: Towards a Unified Framework for Table Recognition via Self-Supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tables convey factual and quantitative data with implicit conventions created by humans that are often challenging for machines to parse. Prior work on table recognition (TR) has mainly centered around complex task-specific combinations of available inputs and tools. We present UniTable, a training framework that unifies both the training paradigm and training objective of TR. Its training paradigm combines the simplicity of purely pixel-level inputs with the effectiveness and scalability empowered by self-supervised pretraining from diverse unannotated tabular images. Our framework unifies the training objectives of all three TR tasks - extracting table structure, cell content, and cell bounding box - into a unified task-agnostic training objective: language modeling. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses highlight UniTable's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four of the largest TR datasets. UniTable's table parsing capability has surpassed both existing TR methods and general large vision-language models, e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo with vision, and LLaVA. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/poloclub/unitable, featuring a Jupyter Notebook that includes the complete inference pipeline, fine-tuned across multiple TR datasets, supporting all three TR tasks.</description>

      <title>Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</description>

      <title>Can Generative Models Improve Self-Supervised Representation Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in self-supervised learning (SSL) has highlighted its potential to leverage unlabeled data for learning rich visual representations. However, the existing SSL techniques, particularly those employing different augmentations of the same image, often rely on a limited set of simple transformations that are not representative of real-world data variations. This constrains the diversity and quality of samples, which leads to sub-optimal representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that enriches the SSL paradigm by utilizing generative models to produce semantically consistent image augmentations. By directly conditioning generative models on a source image representation, our method enables the generation of diverse augmentations while maintaining the semantics of the source image, thus offering a richer set of data for self-supervised learning. Our extensive experimental results on various SSL methods demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the quality of learned visual representations by up to 10\% Top-1 accuracy in downstream tasks. This research demonstrates that incorporating generative models into the SSL workflow opens new avenues for exploring the potential of synthetic data. This development paves the way for more robust and versatile representation learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Microcanonical Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microcanonical gradient descent is a sampling procedure for energy-based models allowing for efficient sampling of distributions in high dimension. It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of financial time series, illustrating the improvements on both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</description>

      <title>Explore until Confident: Efficient Exploration for Embodied Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA), which refers to settings where an embodied agent such as a robot needs to actively explore an environment to gather information until it is confident about the answer to a question. In this work, we leverage the strong semantic reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs) to efficiently explore and answer such questions. However, there are two main challenges when using VLMs in EQA: they do not have an internal memory for mapping the scene to be able to plan how to explore over time, and their confidence can be miscalibrated and can cause the robot to prematurely stop exploration or over-explore. We propose a method that first builds a semantic map of the scene based on depth information and via visual prompting of a VLM - leveraging its vast knowledge of relevant regions of the scene for exploration. Next, we use conformal prediction to calibrate the VLM's question answering confidence, allowing the robot to know when to stop exploration - leading to a more calibrated and efficient exploration strategy. To test our framework in simulation, we also contribute a new EQA dataset with diverse, realistic human-robot scenarios and scenes built upon the Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D). Both simulated and real robot experiments show our proposed approach improves the performance and efficiency over baselines that do no leverage VLM for exploration or do not calibrate its confidence.

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Multi-task learning via robust regularized clustering with non-convex group penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve estimation and prediction performance by sharing common information among related tasks. One natural assumption in MTL is that tasks are classified into clusters based on their characteristics. However, existing MTL methods based on this assumption often ignore outlier tasks that have large task-specific components or no relation to other tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel MTL method called Multi-Task Learning via Robust Regularized Clustering (MTLRRC). MTLRRC incorporates robust regularization terms inspired by robust convex clustering, which is further extended to handle non-convex and group-sparse penalties. The extension allows MTLRRC to simultaneously perform robust task clustering and outlier task detection. The connection between the extended robust clustering and the multivariate M-estimator is also established. This provides an interpretation of the robustness of MTLRRC against outlier tasks. An efficient algorithm based on a modified alternating direction method of multipliers is developed for the estimation of the parameters. The effectiveness of MTLRRC is demonstrated through simulation studies and application to real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article considers the generative modeling of the (mixed) states of quantum systems, and an approach based on denoising diffusion model is proposed. The key contribution is an algorithmic innovation that respects the physical nature of quantum states. More precisely, the commonly used density matrix representation of mixed-state has to be complex-valued Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace one. Generic diffusion models, or other generative methods, may not be able to generate data that strictly satisfy these structural constraints, even if all training data do. To develop a machine learning algorithm that has physics hard-wired in, we leverage mirror diffusion and borrow the physical notion of von Neumann entropy to design a new map, for enabling strict structure-preserving generation. Both unconditional generation and conditional generation via classifier-free guidance are experimentally demonstrated efficacious, the latter enabling the design of new quantum states when generated on unseen labels.</description>

      <title>PM2: A New Prompting Multi-modal Model Paradigm for Few-shot Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Few-shot learning has been successfully applied to medical image classification as only very few medical examples are available for training. Due to the challenging problem of limited number of annotated medical images, image representations should not be solely derived from a single image modality which is insufficient for characterizing concept classes. In this paper, we propose a new prompting multi-modal model paradigm on medical image classification based on multi-modal foundation models, called PM2. Besides image modality,PM2 introduces another supplementary text input, known as prompt, to further describe corresponding image or concept classes and facilitate few-shot learning across diverse modalities. To better explore the potential of prompt engineering, we empirically investigate five distinct prompt schemes under the new paradigm. Furthermore, linear probing in multi-modal models acts as a linear classification head taking as input only class token, which ignores completely merits of rich statistics inherent in high-level visual tokens. Thus, we alternatively perform a linear classification on feature distribution of visual tokens and class token simultaneously. To effectively mine such rich statistics, a global covariance pooling with efficient matrix power normalization is used to aggregate visual tokens. Then we study and combine two classification heads. One is shared for class token of image from vision encoder and prompt representation encoded by text encoder. The other is to classification on feature distribution of visual tokens from vision encoder. Extensive experiments on three medical datasets show that our PM2 significantly outperforms counterparts regardless of prompt schemes and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Curse of Dimensionality for Certified Robustness via Dual Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) has been proven a promising method for endowing an arbitrary image classifier with certified robustness. However, the substantial uncertainty inherent in the high-dimensional isotropic Gaussian noise imposes the curse of dimensionality on RS. Specifically, the upper bound of ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius provided by RS exhibits a diminishing trend with the expansion of the input dimension $d$, proportionally decreasing at a rate of $1/\sqrt{d}$. This paper explores the feasibility of providing ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness for high-dimensional input through the utilization of dual smoothing in the lower-dimensional space. The proposed Dual Randomized Smoothing (DRS) down-samples the input image into two sub-images and smooths the two sub-images in lower dimensions. Theoretically, we prove that DRS guarantees a tight ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness radius for the original input and reveal that DRS attains a superior upper bound on the ${\ell_2}$ robustness radius, which decreases proportionally at a rate of $(1/\sqrt m + 1/\sqrt n )$ with $m+n=d$. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of DRS, which exhibits a notable capability to integrate with established methodologies, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and ${\ell_2}$ certified robustness baselines of RS on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.

      <title>Debiased Distribution Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern compression methods can summarize a target distribution $\mathbb{P}$ more succinctly than i.i.d. sampling but require access to a low-bias input sequence like a Markov chain converging quickly to $\mathbb{P}$. We introduce a new suite of compression methods suitable for compression with biased input sequences. Given $n$ points targeting the wrong distribution and quadratic time, Stein kernel thinning (SKT) returns $\sqrt{n}$ equal-weighted points with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1/2})$ maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to $\mathbb{P}$. For larger-scale compression tasks, low-rank SKT achieves the same feat in sub-quadratic time using an adaptive low-rank debiasing procedure that may be of independent interest. For downstream tasks that support simplex or constant-preserving weights, Stein recombination and Stein Cholesky achieve even greater parsimony, matching the guarantees of SKT with as few as $\text{poly-log}(n)$ weighted points. Underlying these advances are new guarantees for the quality of simplex-weighted coresets, the spectral decay of kernel matrices, and the covering numbers of Stein kernel Hilbert spaces. In our experiments, our techniques provide succinct and accurate posterior summaries while overcoming biases due to burn-in, approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo, and tempering.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Thermoelectric Cooling for On-Demand Multi-Hotspot Thermal Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectric coolers (TECs) offer a promising solution for direct cooling of local hotspots and active thermal management in advanced electronic systems. However, TECs present significant trade-offs among spatial cooling, heating and power consumption. The optimization of TECs requires extensive simulations, which are impractical for managing actual systems with multiple hotspots under spatial and temporal variations. In this study, we present a novel machine learning-assisted optimization algorithm for thermoelectric coolers that can achieve global optimal temperature by individually controlling TEC units based on real-time multi-hotspot conditions across the entire domain. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a combination of the Inception module and multi-task learning (MTL) approach to comprehend the coupled thermal-electrical physics underlying the system and attain accurate predictions for both temperature and power consumption with and without TECs. Due to the intricate interaction among passive thermal gradient, Peltier effect and Joule effect, a local optimal TEC control experiences spatial temperature trade-off which may not lead to a global optimal solution. To address this issue, we develop a backtracking-based optimization algorithm using the machine learning model to iterate all possible TEC assignments for attaining global optimal solutions. For any m by n matrix with NHS hotspots (n, m &lt;= 10, 0&lt;= NHS &lt;= 20), our algorithm is capable of providing 52.4% peak temperature reduction and its corresponding TEC array control within an average of 1.64 seconds while iterating through tens of temperature predictions behind-the-scenes. This represents a speed increase of over three orders of magnitude compared to traditional FEM strategies which take approximately 27 minutes.</description>

      <title>RealTCD: Temporal Causal Discovery from Interventional Data with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of Artificial Intelligence for Information Technology Operations, causal discovery is pivotal for operation and maintenance of graph construction, facilitating downstream industrial tasks such as root cause analysis. Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures.</description>

      <title>Functional Protein Design with Local Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation (PAAG), a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a nearly sixfold increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 8.7% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model.</description>

      <title>RLHF from Heterogeneous Feedback via Personalization and Preference Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been an effective technique for aligning AI systems with human values, with remarkable successes in fine-tuning large-language models recently. Most existing RLHF paradigms make the underlying assumption that human preferences are relatively homogeneous, and can be encoded by a single reward model. In this paper, we focus on addressing the issues due to the inherent heterogeneity in human preferences, as well as their potential strategic behavior in providing feedback. Specifically, we propose two frameworks to address heterogeneous human feedback in principled ways: personalization-based one and aggregation-based one. For the former, we propose two approaches based on representation learning and clustering, respectively, for learning multiple reward models that trades off the bias (due to preference heterogeneity) and variance (due to the use of fewer data for learning each model by personalization). We then establish sample complexity guarantees for both approaches. For the latter, we aim to adhere to the single-model framework, as already deployed in the current RLHF paradigm, by carefully aggregating diverse and truthful preferences from humans. We propose two approaches based on reward and preference aggregation, respectively: the former utilizes both utilitarianism and Leximin approaches to aggregate individual reward models, with sample complexity guarantees; the latter directly aggregates the human feedback in the form of probabilistic opinions. Under the probabilistic-opinion-feedback model, we also develop an approach to handle strategic human labelers who may bias and manipulate the aggregated preferences with untruthful feedback. Based on the ideas in mechanism design, our approach ensures truthful preference reporting, with the induced aggregation rule maximizing social welfare functions.</description>

      <title>Fair Recommendations with Limited Sensitive Attributes: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As recommender systems are indispensable in various domains such as job searching and e-commerce, providing equitable recommendations to users with different sensitive attributes becomes an imperative requirement. Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information.
  Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible.</description>

      <title>Cutting through buggy adversarial example defenses: fixing 1 line of code breaks Sabre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sabre is a defense to adversarial examples that was accepted at IEEE S&amp;P 2024. We first reveal significant flaws in the evaluation that point to clear signs of gradient masking. We then show the cause of this gradient masking: a bug in the original evaluation code. By fixing a single line of code in the original repository, we reduce Sabre's robust accuracy to 0%. In response to this, the authors modify the defense and introduce a new defense component not described in the original paper. But this fix contains a second bug; modifying one more line of code reduces robust accuracy to below baseline levels. After we released the first version of our paper online, the authors introduced another change to the defense; by commenting out one line of code during attack we reduce the robust accuracy to 0% again.</description>

      <title>TALC: Time-Aligned Captions for Multi-Scene Text-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have led to the development of text-to-video (T2V) models that can generate high-quality videos conditioned on a text prompt. Most of these T2V models often produce single-scene video clips that depict an entity performing a particular action (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree'). However, it is pertinent to generate multi-scene videos since they are ubiquitous in the real-world (e.g., 'a red panda climbing a tree' followed by 'the red panda sleeps on the top of the tree'). To generate multi-scene videos from a pretrained T2V model, we introduce Time-Aligned Captions (TALC) framework. Specifically, we enhance the text-conditioning mechanism in the T2V architecture to recognize the temporal alignment between the video scenes and scene descriptions. As a result, we show that the pretrained T2V model can generate multi-scene videos that adhere to the multi-scene text descriptions and be visually consistent (e.g., w.r.t entity and background). Our TALC-finetuned model outperforms the baseline methods on multi-scene video-text data by 15.5 points on aggregated score, averaging visual consistency and text adherence using human evaluation.

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Threat Intelligence at the Edge Devices: A Large Language Model-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of edge devices, there is a significant increase in attack surface on these devices. The decentralized deployment of threat intelligence on edge devices, coupled with adaptive machine learning techniques such as the in-context learning feature of Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising paradigm for enhancing cybersecurity on resource-constrained edge devices. This approach involves the deployment of lightweight machine learning models directly onto edge devices to analyze local data streams, such as network traffic and system logs, in real-time. Additionally, distributing computational tasks to an edge server reduces latency and improves responsiveness while also enhancing privacy by processing sensitive data locally. LLM servers can enable these edge servers to autonomously adapt to evolving threats and attack patterns, continuously updating their models to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives. Furthermore, collaborative learning mechanisms facilitate peer-to-peer secure and trustworthy knowledge sharing among edge devices, enhancing the collective intelligence of the network and enabling dynamic threat mitigation measures such as device quarantine in response to detected anomalies. The scalability and flexibility of this approach make it well-suited for diverse and evolving network environments, as edge devices only send suspicious information such as network traffic and system log changes, offering a resilient and efficient solution to combat emerging cyber threats at the network edge. Thus, our proposed framework can improve edge computing security by providing better security in cyber threat detection and mitigation by isolating the edge devices from the network.</description>

      <title>From Local to Global Order: A Theory of Neural Synaptic Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of neural synaptic balance and how it can emerge or be enforced in neural networks. For a given additive cost function $R$ (regularizer), a neuron is said to be in balance if the total cost of its input weights is equal to the total cost of its output weights. The basic example is provided by feedforward networks of ReLU units trained with $L_2$ regularizers, which exhibit balance after proper training. The theory explains this phenomenon and extends it in several directions. The first direction is the extension to bilinear and other activation functions. The second direction is the extension to more general regularizers, including all $L_p$ ($p&gt;0$) regularizers. The third direction is the extension to non-layered architectures, recurrent architectures, convolutional architectures, as well as architectures with mixed activation functions. The theory is based on two local neuronal operations: scaling which is commutative, and balancing which is not commutative. Finally, and most importantly, given any initial set of weights, when local balancing operations are applied to each neuron in a stochastic manner, global order always emerges through the convergence of the stochastic balancing algorithm to the same unique set of balanced weights. The reason for this convergence is the existence of an underlying strictly convex optimization problem where the relevant variables are constrained to a linear, only architecture-dependent, manifold. The theory is corroborated through various simulations carried out on benchmark data sets. Scaling and balancing operations are entirely local and thus physically plausible in biological and neuromorphic networks.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviours, such as generating untruthful or biased content. Editing their internal representations has been shown to be effective in mitigating such behaviours on top of the existing alignment methods. We propose a novel inference-time editing method, namely spectral editing of activations (SEA), to project the input representations into directions with maximal covariance with the positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) while minimising covariance with the negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinated). We also extend our method to non-linear editing using feature functions. We run extensive experiments on benchmarks concerning truthfulness and bias with six open-source LLMs of different sizes and model families. The results demonstrate the superiority of SEA in effectiveness, generalisation to similar tasks, as well as computation and data efficiency. We also show that SEA editing only has a limited negative impact on other model capabilities.</description>

      <title>The CAP Principle for LLM Serving: A Survey of Long-Context Large Language Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the large language model (LLM) serving area to understand the intricate dynamics between cost-efficiency and accuracy, which is magnified by the growing need for longer contextual understanding when deploying models at a massive scale. Our findings reveal that works in this space optimize along three distinct but conflicting goals: improving serving context length (C), improving serving accuracy (A), and improving serving performance (P). Drawing inspiration from the CAP theorem in databases, we propose a CAP principle for LLM serving, which suggests that any optimization can improve at most two of these three goals simultaneously. Our survey categorizes existing works within this framework. We find the definition and continuity of user-perceived measurement metrics are crucial in determining whether a goal has been met, akin to prior CAP databases in the wild. We recognize the CAP principle for LLM serving as a guiding principle, rather than a formal theorem, to inform designers of the inherent and dynamic trade-offs in serving models. As serving accuracy and performance have been extensively studied, this survey focuses on works that extend serving context length and address the resulting challenges.</description>

      <title>Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large policies pretrained on diverse robot datasets have the potential to transform robotic learning: instead of training new policies from scratch, such generalist robot policies may be finetuned with only a little in-domain data, yet generalize broadly. However, to be widely applicable across a range of robotic learning scenarios, environments, and tasks, such policies need to handle diverse sensors and action spaces, accommodate a variety of commonly used robotic platforms, and finetune readily and efficiently to new domains. In this work, we aim to lay the groundwork for developing open-source, widely applicable, generalist policies for robotic manipulation. As a first step, we introduce Octo, a large transformer-based policy trained on 800k trajectories from the Open X-Embodiment dataset, the largest robot manipulation dataset to date. It can be instructed via language commands or goal images and can be effectively finetuned to robot setups with new sensory inputs and action spaces within a few hours on standard consumer GPUs. In experiments across 9 robotic platforms, we demonstrate that Octo serves as a versatile policy initialization that can be effectively finetuned to new observation and action spaces. We also perform detailed ablations of design decisions for the Octo model, from architecture to training data, to guide future research on building generalist robot models.</description>

      <title>Joint Prediction Regions for time-series models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are notorious for providing point predictions but not prediction intervals. There are many applications where one requires confidence in predictions and prediction intervals. Stringing together, these intervals give rise to joint prediction regions with the desired significance level. It is an easy task to compute Joint Prediction regions (JPR) when the data is IID. However, the task becomes overly difficult when JPR is needed for time series because of the dependence between the observations. This project aims to implement Wolf and Wunderli's method for constructing JPRs and compare it with other methods (e.g. NP heuristic, Joint Marginals). The method under study is based on bootstrapping and is applied to different datasets (Min Temp, Sunspots), using different predictors (e.g. ARIMA and LSTM). One challenge of applying the method under study is to derive prediction standard errors for models, it cannot be obtained analytically. A novel method to estimate prediction standard error for different predictors is also devised. Finally, the method is applied to a synthetic dataset to find empirical averages and empirical widths and the results from the Wolf and Wunderli paper are consolidated. The experimental results show a narrowing of width with strong predictors like neural nets, widening of width with increasing forecast horizon H and decreasing significance level alpha, controlling the width with parameter k in K-FWE, and loss of information using Joint Marginals.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Detection in C/C++ Code with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be a promising tool in detecting software vulnerabilities. In this work, we train neural networks with program slices extracted from the source code of C/C++ programs to detect software vulnerabilities. The program slices capture the syntax and semantic characteristics of vulnerability-related program constructs, including API function call, array usage, pointer usage, and arithmetic expression. To achieve a strong prediction model for both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code, we compare different types of training data, different optimizers, and different types of neural networks. Our result shows that combining different types of characteristics of source code and using a balanced number of vulnerable program slices and non-vulnerable program slices produce a balanced accuracy in predicting both vulnerable code and non-vulnerable code. Among different neural networks, BGRU with the ADAM optimizer performs the best in detecting software vulnerabilities with an accuracy of 92.49%.</description>

      <title>LLM Processes: Numerical Predictive Distributions Conditioned on Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning practitioners often face significant challenges in formally integrating their prior knowledge and beliefs into predictive models, limiting the potential for nuanced and context-aware analyses. Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of the Alternating Directions SGHMC Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms with leapfrog integration under mild conditions on stochastic gradient oracle for the target distribution (SGHMC). Our method extends standard HMC by allowing the use of general auxiliary distributions, which is achieved by a novel procedure of Alternating Directions.
  The convergence analysis is based on the investigations of the Dirichlet forms associated with the underlying Markov chain driving the algorithms. For this purpose, we provide a detailed analysis on the error of the leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian motions with both the kinetic and potential energy functions in general form. We characterize the explicit dependence of the convergence rates on key parameters such as the problem dimension, functional properties of both the target and auxiliary distributions, and the quality of the oracle.</description>

      <title>Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this problem, we propose a novel solution named User Interest Enhancement (UIE) which enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences using the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vector generated based on stream clustering and memory networks from different perspectives. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance on the users with sparse interest but also significantly enhance model performance on other users. UIE is an end-to-end solution which is easy to be implemented based on ranking model. Moreover, we expand our solution and apply similar methods to long-tail items, which also achieves excellent improvement. Furthermore, we conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale industrial RS. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably, especially for the users with sparse interest. Until now, UIE has been fully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs and achieved remarkable improvements.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Safety Controllers Through Learning Deep Inverse Dynamics Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control barrier certificates have proven effective in formally guaranteeing the safety of the control systems. However, designing a control barrier certificate is a time-consuming and computationally expensive endeavor that requires expert input in the form of domain knowledge and mathematical maturity. Additionally, when a system undergoes slight changes, the new controller and its correctness certificate need to be recomputed, incurring similar computational challenges as those faced during the design of the original controller. Prior approaches have utilized transfer learning to transfer safety guarantees in the form of a barrier certificate while maintaining the control invariant. Unfortunately, in practical settings, the source and the target environments often deviate substantially in their control inputs, rendering the aforementioned approach impractical. To address this challenge, we propose integrating \emph{inverse dynamics} -- a neural network that suggests required action given a desired successor state -- of the target system with the barrier certificate of the source system to provide formal proof of safety. In addition, we propose a validity condition that, when met, guarantees correctness of the controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies.</description>

      <title>EchoSpike Predictive Plasticity: An Online Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drive to develop artificial neural networks that efficiently utilize resources has generated significant interest in bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). These networks are particularly attractive due to their potential in applications requiring low power and memory. This potential is further enhanced by the ability to perform online local learning, enabling them to adapt to dynamic environments. This requires the model to be adaptive in a self-supervised manner. While self-supervised learning has seen great success in many deep learning domains, its application for online local learning in multi-layer SNNs remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the "EchoSpike Predictive Plasticity" (ESPP) learning rule, a pioneering online local learning rule designed to leverage hierarchical temporal dynamics in SNNs through predictive and contrastive coding. We validate the effectiveness of this approach using benchmark datasets, demonstrating that it performs on par with current state-of-the-art supervised learning rules. The temporal and spatial locality of ESPP makes it particularly well-suited for low-cost neuromorphic processors, representing a significant advancement in developing biologically plausible self-supervised learning models for neuromorphic computing at the edge.</description>

      <title>RadarOcc: Robust 3D Occupancy Prediction with 4D Imaging Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Subtle Biases Need Subtler Measures: Dual Metrics for Evaluating Representative and Affinity Bias in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has often neglected subtle biases that, although less apparent, can significantly influence the models' outputs toward particular social narratives. This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including proprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector and the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to enhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's critical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and democratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI adoption in financial decision-making. In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Logical Rules in Knowledge Editing: A Cherry on the Top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-hop Question Answering (MQA) under knowledge editing (KE) is a key challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). While best-performing solutions in this domain use a plan and solve paradigm to split a question into sub-questions followed by response generation, we claim that this approach is sub-optimal as it fails for hard to decompose questions, and it does not explicitly cater to correlated knowledge updates resulting as a consequence of knowledge edits. This has a detrimental impact on the overall consistency of the updated knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework named RULE-KE, i.e., RULE based Knowledge Editing, which is a cherry on the top for augmenting the performance of all existing MQA methods under KE. Specifically, RULE-KE leverages rule discovery to discover a set of logical rules. Then, it uses these discovered rules to update knowledge about facts highly correlated with the edit. Experimental evaluation using existing and newly curated datasets (i.e., RKE-EVAL) shows that RULE-KE helps augment both performances of parameter-based and memory-based solutions up to 92% and 112.9%, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable advancements in deep neural networks have brought tremendous convenience. However, the training process of a highly effective model necessitates a substantial quantity of samples, which brings huge potential threats, like unauthorized exploitation with privacy leakage. In response, we propose a framework named HiddenSpeaker, embedding imperceptible perturbations within the training speech samples and rendering them unlearnable for deep-learning-based speaker verification systems that employ large-scale speakers for efficient training. The HiddenSpeaker utilizes a simplified error-minimizing method named Single-Level Error-Minimizing (SLEM) to generate specific and effective perturbations. Additionally, a hybrid objective function is employed for human perceptual optimization, ensuring the perturbation is indistinguishable from human listeners. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the speaker verification domain to evaluate HiddenSpeaker. Our results demonstrate that HiddenSpeaker not only deceives the model with unlearnable samples but also enhances the imperceptibility of the perturbations, showcasing strong transferability across different models.</description>
