Abstract: GUI agents have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating interactions in digital environments, yet achieving both broad generality and consistently strong task performance remains challenging.In this report, we present UI-Venus-1.5, a unified, end-to-end GUI Agent designed for robust real-world applications.The proposed model family comprises two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts variant (30B-A3B) to meet various downstream application scenarios.Compared to our previous version, UI-Venus-1.5 introduces three key technical advances: (1) a comprehensive Mid-Training stage leveraging 10 billion tokens across 30+ datasets to establish foundational GUI semantics; (2) Online Reinforcement Learning with full-trajectory rollouts, aligning training objectives with long-horizon, dynamic navigation in large-scale environments; and (3) a single unified GUI Agent constructed via Model Merging, which synthesizes domain-specific models (grounding, web, and mobile) into one cohesive checkpoint. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines. In addition, UI-Venus-1.5 demonstrates robust navigation capabilities across a variety of Chinese mobile apps, effectively executing user instructions in real-world scenarios.

      <title>Agent Banana: High-Fidelity Image Editing with Agentic Thinking and Tooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study instruction-based image editing under professional workflows and identify three persistent challenges: (i) editors often over-edit, modifying content beyond the user's intent; (ii) existing models are largely single-turn, while multi-turn edits can alter object faithfulness; and (iii) evaluation at around 1K resolution is misaligned with real workflows that often operate on ultra high-definition images (e.g., 4K). We propose Agent Banana, a hierarchical agentic planner-executor framework for high-fidelity, object-aware, deliberative editing. Agent Banana introduces two key mechanisms: (1) Context Folding, which compresses long interaction histories into structured memory for stable long-horizon control; and (2) Image Layer Decomposition, which performs localized layer-based edits to preserve non-target regions while enabling native-resolution outputs. To support rigorous evaluation, we build HDD-Bench, a high-definition, dialogue-based benchmark featuring verifiable stepwise targets and native 4K images (11.8M pixels) for diagnosing long-horizon failures. On HDD-Bench, Agent Banana achieves the best multi-turn consistency and background fidelity (e.g., IC 0.871, SSIM-OM 0.84, LPIPS-OM 0.12) while remaining competitive on instruction following, and also attains strong performance on standard single-turn editing benchmarks. We hope this work advances reliable, professional-grade agentic image editing and its integration into real workflows.</description>

      <title>SemanticMoments: Training-Free Motion Similarity via Third Moment Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieving videos based on semantic motion is a fundamental, yet unsolved, problem. Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Deterministic Framework for Named Entity Extraction in Broadcast News Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.
  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts. The proposed pipeline delivers balanced precision (79.9%) and recall (74.4%), avoids hallucination, and provides full traceability across each processing stage. Complementary user findings indicate that 59% of respondents report difficulty reading on-screen names in fast-paced broadcasts, underscoring the practical relevance of the task. The results establish a methodologically rigorous and interpretable baseline for hybrid multimodal information extraction in modern news media.</description>

      <title>Decoding Future Risk: Deep Learning Analysis of Tubular Adenoma Whole-Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality, despite the widespread implementation of prophylactic initiatives aimed at detecting and removing precancerous polyps. Although screening effectively reduces incidence, a notable portion of patients initially diagnosed with low-grade adenomatous polyps will still develop CRC later in life, even without the presence of known high-risk syndromes. Identifying which low-risk patients are at higher risk of progression is a critical unmet need for tailored surveillance and preventative therapeutic strategies. Traditional histological assessment of adenomas, while fundamental, may not fully capture subtle architectural or cytological features indicative of malignant potential. Advancements in digital pathology and machine learning provide an opportunity to analyze whole-slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and objectively. This study investigates whether machine learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can detect subtle histological features in WSIs of low-grade tubular adenomas that are predictive of a patient's long-term risk of developing colorectal cancer.</description>

      <title>All-in-One Conditioning for Text-to-Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visual representation of complex prompts involving multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relationships is a critical challenge in text-to-image synthesis. Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization. This enables the model to maintain text-image alignment while supporting lightweight, coherent, and diverse image synthesis.</description>

      <title>Wearable environmental sensing to forecast how legged systems will interact with upcoming terrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-vision (CV) has been used for environmental classification during gait and is often used to inform control in assistive systems; however, the ability to predict how the foot will contact a changing environment is underexplored. We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.</description>

      <title>VLM-UQBench: A Benchmark for Modality-Specific and Cross-Modality Uncertainties in Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for ensuring that vision-language models (VLMs) behave safely and reliably. A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.</description>

      <title>VLM-Guided Iterative Refinement for Surgical Image Segmentation with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical image segmentation is essential for robot-assisted surgery and intraoperative guidance. However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Global Text Conditioning in Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers typically incorporate textual information via attention layers and a modulation mechanism using a pooled text embedding. Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.</description>

      <title>X-Mark: Saliency-Guided Robust Dataset Ownership Verification for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality medical imaging datasets are essential for training deep learning models, but their unauthorized use raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>A Deep Multi-Modal Method for Patient Wound Healing Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hospitalization of patients is one of the major factors for high wound care costs. Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.</description>

      <title>GAFR-Net: A Graph Attention and Fuzzy-Rule Network for Interpretable Breast Cancer Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate classification of breast cancer histopathology images is pivotal for early oncological diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.However, conventional deep learning architectures often encounter performance degradation under limited annotations and suffer from a "blackbox" nature, hindering their clinical integration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose GAFRNet, a robust and interpretable Graph Attention and FuzzyRule Network specifically engineered for histopathology image classification with scarce supervision. GAFRNet constructs a similarity-driven graph representation to model intersample relationships and employs a multihead graph attention mechanism to capture complex relational features across heterogeneous tissue structures.Concurrently, a differentiable fuzzy-rule module encodes intrinsic topological descriptorsincluding node degree, clustering coefficient, and label consistencyinto explicit, human-understandable diagnostic logic. This design establishes transparent "IF-THEN" mappings that mimic the heuristic deduction process of medical experts, providing clear reasoning behind each prediction without relying on post-hoc attribution methods. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets (BreakHis, Mini-DDSM, and ICIAR2018) demonstrate that GAFR-Net consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art methods across multiple magnifications and classification tasks. These results validate the superior generalization and practical utility of GAFR-Net as a reliable decision-support tool for weakly supervised medical image analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep models based on vision transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) have demonstrated remarkable performance on natural datasets. However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\sim 60\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model. ConvNext series are suitable for in-distribution samples, while ViT and its variants are suitable for interpreting out-of-distribution samples.</description>

      <title>Kyrtos: A methodology for automatic deep analysis of graphic charts with curves in technical documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Understanding of Technical Documents (DUTD) has become a very attractive field with great potential due to large amounts of accumulated documents and the valuable knowledge contained in them. In addition, the holistic understanding of technical documents depends on the accurate analysis of its particular modalities, such as graphics, tables, diagrams, text, etc. and their associations. In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the accuracy of Kyrtos' recognition and analysis methods by measuring the structural similarity between input chart curves and the approximations generated by Kyrtos for charts with multiple functions.</description>

      <title>Impact of domain adaptation in deep learning for medical image classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) is a quickly expanding area in machine learning that involves adjusting a model trained in one domain to perform well in another domain. While there have been notable progressions, the fundamental concept of numerous DA methodologies has persisted: aligning the data from various domains into a shared feature space. In this space, knowledge acquired from labeled source data can improve the model training on target data that lacks sufficient labels. In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\sim 3\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\sim 0.3\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\sim 2\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset.</description>

      <title>Fully Differentiable Bidirectional Dual-Task Synergistic Learning for Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Single-Slice-to-3D Reconstruction in Medical Imaging and Natural Objects: A Comparative Benchmark with SAM 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.</description>

      <title>K-Sort Eval: Efficient Preference Evaluation for Visual Generation via Corrected VLM-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>LARV: Data-Free Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer for Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.</description>

      <title>Stability and Concentration in Nonlinear Inverse Problems with Block-Structured Parameters: Lipschitz Geometry, Identifiability, and an Application to Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Modality Gap in Roadside LiDAR: A Training-Free Vision-Language Model Framework for Vehicle Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a "Semantic Anchor" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k &lt; 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.</description>

      <title>SceneReVis: A Self-Reflective Vision-Grounded Framework for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Multi-turn RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current one-pass 3D scene synthesis methods often suffer from spatial hallucinations, such as collisions, due to a lack of deliberative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce SceneReVis, a vision-grounded self-reflection framework that employs an iterative ``diagnose-and-act'' loop to explicitly intercept and resolve spatial conflicts using multi-modal feedback. To support this step-wise paradigm, we construct SceneChain-12k, a large-scale dataset of causal construction trajectories derived through a novel reverse engineering pipeline. We further propose a two-stage training recipe that transitions from Supervised Fine-Tuning to Agentic Reinforcement Learning, evolving the model into an active spatial planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneReVis achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-fidelity generation and goal-oriented optimization, with robust generalization to long-tail domains.</description>

      <title>Fine-T2I: An Open, Large-Scale, and Diverse Dataset for High-Quality T2I Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review of Deep Learning for Urban Visual Pollution and Proposal of a Real-Time Monitoring Framework with a Visual Pollution Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Visual Pollution (UVP) has emerged as a critical concern, yet research on automatic detection and application remains fragmented. This scoping review maps the existing deep learning-based approaches for detecting, classifying, and designing a comprehensive application framework for visual pollution management. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, seven academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerNatureLink, and Wiley) were systematically searched and reviewed, and 26 articles were found. Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers.</description>

      <title>Look-Ahead and Look-Back Flows: Training-Free Image Generation with Trajectory Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.</description>

      <title>ArtifactLens: Hundreds of Labels Are Enough for Artifact Detection with VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.</description>

      <title>FD-DB: Frequency-Decoupled Dual-Branch Network for Unpaired Synthetic-to-Real Domain Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Patch Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.
  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets. Our related code is available at github.com/BzhangURU/Paper_WeakSupCon_for_MIL</description>

      <title>Beyond Next-Token Alignment: Distilling Multimodal Large Language Models via Token Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.</description>

      <title>OSI: One-step Inversion Excels in Extracting Diffusion Watermarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium contrastive learning for imbalanced image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Robust Depth Super-Resolution via Adaptive Diffusion Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Fast Object Detection on Edge Devices for IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Universal Action Space for General Behavior Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/franktpmvu/Universal-Action-Space.</description>

      <title>Attention to details, logits to truth: visual-aware attention and logits enhancement to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Singpath-VL, a vision-language large model, to fill the vacancy of AI assistant in cervical cytology. Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.</description>

      <title>HLGFA: High-Low Resolution Guided Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (UAD) is essential for modern manufacturing inspection, where defect samples are scarce and reliable detection is required. In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.</description>

      <title>Schr\"oMind: Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models via Solving the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose Schr\"oMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schr\"odinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schr\"odinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>SCA-Net: Spatial-Contextual Aggregation Network for Enhanced Small Building and Road Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated change detection in remote sensing imagery is critical for urban management, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment. While deep learning models have advanced this field, they often struggle with challenges like low sensitivity to small objects and high computational costs. This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%. This work provides an efficient, accurate, and robust solution for practical change detection applications.</description>

      <title>DR.Experts: Differential Refinement of Distortion-Aware Experts for Blind Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.</description>

      <title>RAD: Retrieval-Augmented Monocular Metric Depth Estimation for Underrepresented Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.</description>

      <title>AUHead: Realistic Emotional Talking Head Generation via Action Units Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an "emotion-then-AU" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

      <title>Scalpel: Fine-Grained Alignment of Attention Activation Manifolds via Mixture Gaussian Bridges to Mitigate Multimodal Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schr\"odinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.</description>

      <title>Delving into Spectral Clustering with Vision-Language Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral clustering is known as a powerful technique in unsupervised data analysis. The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.</description>

      <title>MieDB-100k: A Comprehensive Dataset for Medical Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality data remains a primary bottleneck in adapting multimodal generative models for medical image editing. Existing medical image editing datasets often suffer from limited diversity, neglect of medical image understanding and inability to balance quality with scalability. To address these gaps, we propose MieDB-100k, a large-scale, high-quality and diverse dataset for text-guided medical image editing. It categorizes editing tasks into perspectives of Perception, Modification and Transformation, considering both understanding and generation abilities. We construct MieDB-100k via a data curation pipeline leveraging both modality-specific expert models and rule-based data synthetic methods, followed by rigorous manual inspection to ensure clinical fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that model trained with MieDB-100k consistently outperform both open-source and proprietary models while exhibiting strong generalization ability. We anticipate that this dataset will serve as a cornerstone for future advancements in specialized medical image editing.</description>

      <title>Hand2World: Autoregressive Egocentric Interaction Generation via Free-Space Hand Gestures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egocentric interactive world models are essential for augmented reality and embodied AI, where visual generation must respond to user input with low latency, geometric consistency, and long-term stability. We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Pl\"ucker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.</description>

      <title>Tele-Omni: a Unified Multimodal Framework for Video Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.</description>

      <title>AGMark: Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.</description>

      <title>Towards Training-free Multimodal Hate Localisation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.</description>

      <title>VideoAfford: Grounding 3D Affordance from Human-Object-Interaction Videos via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D affordance grounding aims to highlight the actionable regions on 3D objects, which is crucial for robotic manipulation. Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities. All datasets and code will be publicly released to advance research in this area.</description>

      <title>Time2General: Learning Spatiotemporal Invariant Representations for Domain-Generalization Video Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.</description>

      <title>TreeCUA: Efficiently Scaling GUI Automation with Tree-Structured Verifiable Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Liver Segmentation and Patch-based Fibrosis Staging with Registration-aided Multi-parametric MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

      <title>GenSeg-R1: RL-Driven Vision-Language Grounding for Fine-Grained Referring Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.
  Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.
  We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.</description>

      <title>Stroke3D: Lifting 2D strokes into rigged 3D model via latent diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.</description>

      <title>From Lightweight CNNs to SpikeNets: Benchmarking Accuracy-Energy Tradeoffs with Pruned Spiking SqueezeNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.</description>

      <title>Allure of Craquelure: A Variational-Generative Approach to Crack Detection in Paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.</description>

      <title>Toward Fine-Grained Facial Control in 3D Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation is a core component of digital avatars, and 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown strong performance in real-time rendering of high-fidelity talking heads. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.</description>

      <title>Robust Vision Systems for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: Security Challenges and Attack Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of vision systems in Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which is critical for developing Level-5 autonomous driving capabilities. Safe and reliable CAV navigation undeniably depends on robust vision systems that enable accurate detection of objects, lane markings, and traffic signage. We analyze the key sensors and vision components essential for CAV navigation to derive a reference architecture for CAV vision system (CAVVS). This reference architecture provides a basis for identifying potential attack surfaces of CAVVS. Subsequently, we elaborate on identified attack vectors targeting each attack surface, rigorously evaluating their implications for confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of attack vector dynamics in vision systems, which is crucial for formulating robust security measures that can uphold the principles of the CIA triad.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning as Discrete Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.</description>

      <title>Where Do Images Come From? Analyzing Captions to Geographically Profile Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\%$ and $3.8\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($\rho = 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.</description>

      <title>SciFlow-Bench: Evaluating Structure-Aware Scientific Diagram Generation via Inverse Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.</description>

      <title>CompSplat: Compression-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-world Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.</description>

      <title>SAKED: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Stability-Aware Knowledge Enhanced Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>ARK: A Dual-Axis Multimodal Retrieval Benchmark along Reasoning and Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks largely emphasize semantic matching on daily-life images and offer limited diagnostics of professional knowledge and complex reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.</description>

      <title>Reason-IAD: Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Latent Reasoning for Explainable Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.</description>

      <title>Code2World: A GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency.

      <title>Free-GVC: Towards Training-Free Extreme Generative Video Compression with Temporal Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on recent advances in video generation, generative video compression has emerged as a new paradigm for achieving visually pleasing reconstructions. However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.</description>

      <title>BabyMamba-HAR: Lightweight Selective State Space Models for Efficient Human Activity Recognition on Resource Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on wearable and mobile devices is constrained by memory footprint and computational budget, yet competitive accuracy must be maintained across heterogeneous sensor configurations. Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR.</description>

      <title>MVISTA-4D: View-Consistent 4D World Model with Test-Time Action Inference for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.</description>

      <title>AdaTSQ: Pushing the Pareto Frontier of Diffusion Transformers via Temporal-Sensitivity Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Qiushao-E/AdaTSQ.</description>

      <title>SARS: A Novel Face and Body Shape and Appearance Aware 3D Reconstruction System extends Morphable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphable Models (3DMMs) are a type of morphable model that takes 2D images as inputs and recreates the structure and physical appearance of 3D objects, especially human faces and bodies. 3DMM combines identity and expression blendshapes with a basic face mesh to create a detailed 3D model. The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.</description>

      <title>A benchmark for video-based laparoscopic skill analysis and assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery is a complex surgical technique that requires extensive training. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills. However, the development and evaluation of deep learning models is currently hindered by the limited size of available annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task. Furthermore, we present baseline results from a deep learning model as a reference point for future comparisons.</description>

      <title>Monocular Normal Estimation via Shading Sequence Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.</description>

      <title>GeoFormer: A Swin Transformer-Based Framework for Scene-Level Building Height and Footprint Estimation from Sentinel Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional urban data are critical for climate modelling, disaster risk assessment, and urban planning, yet remain scarce due to reliance on proprietary sensors or poor cross-city generalisation. We propose GeoFormer, an open-source Swin Transformer framework that jointly estimates building height (BH) and footprint (BF) on a 100 m grid using only Sentinel-1/2 imagery and open DEM data. A geo-blocked splitting strategy ensures strict spatial independence between training and test sets. Evaluated over 54 diverse cities, GeoFormer achieves a BH RMSE of 3.19 m and a BF RMSE of 0.05, improving 7.5% and 15.3% over the strongest CNN baseline, while maintaining under 3.5 m BH RMSE in cross-continent transfer. Ablation studies confirm that DEM is indispensable for height estimation and that optical reflectance dominates over SAR, though multi-source fusion yields the best overall accuracy. All code, weights, and global products are publicly released.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced optimal transport for robust longitudinal lesion evolution with registration-aware and appearance-guided priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.</description>

      <title>VersaViT: Enhancing MLLM Vision Backbones via Task-Guided Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in visual-language understanding, demonstrating superior high-level semantic alignment within their vision encoders. An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.</description>

      <title>Bladder Vessel Segmentation using a Hybrid Attention-Convolution Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific "vascular fingerprint" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Detect Baked Goods with Limited Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.</description>

      <title>Coupled Inference in Diffusion Models for Semantic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many visual scenes can be described as compositions of latent factors. Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.</description>

Abstract: Stains are essential in histopathology to visualize specific tissue characteristics, with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) serving as the clinical standard. However, pathologists frequently
  utilize a variety of special stains for the diagnosis of specific morphologies. Maintaining accurate metadata for these slides is critical for quality control in clinical archives and for
  the integrity of computational pathology datasets. In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly
  used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&amp;E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach.
  On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and
  0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of
  magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches). We conclude that thumbnail-based classification provides a scalable and robust solution for routine visual quality control

      <title>Faster-GS: Analyzing and Improving Gaussian Splatting Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have focused on accelerating optimization while preserving reconstruction quality. However, many proposed methods entangle implementation-level improvements with fundamental algorithmic modifications or trade performance for fidelity, leading to a fragmented research landscape that complicates fair comparison. In this work, we consolidate and evaluate the most effective and broadly applicable strategies from prior 3DGS research and augment them with several novel optimizations. We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.</description>

      <title>Perception with Guarantees: Certified Pose Estimation via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Fake-HR1: Rethinking reasoning of vision language model for synthetic image detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.</description>

      <title>Simple Image Processing and Similarity Measures Can Link Data Samples across Databases through Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.
  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Sets for Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current instance segmentation models achieve high performance on average predictions, but lack principled uncertainty quantification: their outputs are not calibrated, and there is no guarantee that a predicted mask is close to the ground truth. To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask. We apply our algorithm to instance segmentation examples in agricultural field delineation, cell segmentation, and vehicle detection. Empirically, we find that our prediction sets vary in size based on query difficulty and attain the target coverage, outperforming existing baselines such as Learn Then Test, Conformal Risk Control, and morphological dilation-based methods. We provide versions of the algorithm with asymptotic and finite sample guarantees.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Attention for Consistent Video Semantic Segmentation in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks, especially transformer-based architectures, have achieved remarkable success in semantic segmentation for environmental perception. However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines. These results demonstrate STA as an effective architectural enhancement for video-based semantic segmentation applications.</description>

      <title>Can Image Splicing and Copy-Move Forgery Be Detected by the Same Model? Forensim: An Attention-Based State-Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. We also release CMFD-Anything, a new dataset addressing limitations of existing copy-move forgery datasets.</description>

      <title>4RC: 4D Reconstruction via Conditional Querying Anytime and Anywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Causality in Video Diffusers is Separable from Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.</description>

      <title>VideoWorld 2: Learning Transferable Knowledge from Real-world Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.</description>

      <title>Olaf-World: Orienting Latent Actions for Video World Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$\Delta$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>ConsID-Gen: View-Consistent and Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.</description>

      <title>Quantum Multiple Rotation Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Scalable Agentic 3D Scene Generation for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI. Code, demos, and the SAGE-10k dataset can be found on the project page here: https://nvlabs.github.io/sage.</description>

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based on state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD framework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics, 88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed techniques, setting a new benchmark for effective and scalable semantic change detection in remote sensing applications. The complete source code, configuration files, and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>SAS-Net: Scene-Appearance Separation Network for Robust Spatiotemporal Registration in Bidirectional Photoacoustic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional scanning enables rapid functional brain imaging but introduces severe spatiotemporal
  misalignment from coupled scan-direction-dependent domain shift and geometric distortion. Conventional registration methods rely on brightness constancy, an assumption
  violated under bidirectional scanning, leading to unreliable alignment. A unified scene-appearance separation framework is proposed to jointly address domain shift and
  spatial misalignment. The proposed architecture separates domain-invariant scene content from domain-specific appearance characteristics, enabling cross-domain
  reconstruction with geometric preservation. A scene consistency loss promotes geometric correspondence in the latent space, linking domain shift correction with spatial
  registration within a single framework. For in vivo mouse brain vasculature imaging, the proposed method achieves normalized cross-correlation (NCC) of 0.961 and
  structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.894, substantially outperforming conventional methods. Ablation studies demonstrate that domain alignment loss is critical,
  with its removal causing 82% NCC reduction (0.961 to 0.175), while scene consistency and cycle consistency losses provide complementary regularization for optimal
  performance. The method achieves 11.2 ms inference time per frame (86 fps), substantially exceeding typical OR-PAM acquisition rates and enabling real-time processing.
  These results suggest that the proposed framework enables robust high-speed bidirectional OR-PAM for reliable quantitative and longitudinal functional imaging. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAS-Net</description>

Abstract: With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), a wide range of methods have been developed to distribute computation and memory across hardware devices for efficient training and inference. While existing surveys provide descriptive overviews of these techniques, systematic analysis of their benefits and trade offs and how such insights can inform principled methodology for designing optimal distributed systems remain limited. This paper offers a comprehensive review of collective operations and distributed parallel strategies, complemented by mathematical formulations to deepen theoretical understanding. We further examine hybrid parallelization designs, emphasizing communication computation overlap across different stages of model deployment, including both training and inference. Recent advances in automated search for optimal hybrid parallelization strategies using cost models are also discussed. Moreover, we present case studies with mainstream architecture categories to reveal empirical insights to guide researchers and practitioners in parallelism strategy selection. Finally, we highlight open challenges and limitations of current LLM training paradigms and outline promising directions for the next generation of large scale model development.</description>

Abstract: Project Sidewalk is a web-based platform that enables crowdsourcing accessibility of sidewalks at city-scale by virtually walking through city streets using Google Street View. The tool has been used in 40 cities across the world, including the US, Mexico, Chile, and Europe. In this paper, we describe adaptation efforts to enable deployment in Chandigarh, India, including modifying annotation types, provided examples, and integrating VLM-based mission guidance, which adapts instructions based on a street scene and metadata analysis. Our evaluation with 3 annotators indicates the utility of AI-mission guidance with an average score of 4.66. Using this adapted Project Sidewalk tool, we conduct a Points of Interest (POI)-centric accessibility analysis for three sectors in Chandigarh with very different land uses, residential, commercial and institutional covering about 40 km of sidewalks. Across 40 km of roads audited in three sectors and around 230 POIs, we identified 1,644 of 2,913 locations where infrastructure improvements could enhance accessibility.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Enhancing Encoder-based Adversarial Transferability against Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive success across multimodal tasks, but their reliance on visual inputs exposes them to significant adversarial threats. Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses.</description>

      <title>LLM-Grounded Dynamic Task Planning with Hierarchical Temporal Logic for Human-Aware Multi-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.</description>

      <title>ECG-IMN: Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Networks for 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the "black-box" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward "white-box" cardiac diagnostics.</description>

      <title>AnyTouch 2: General Optical Tactile Representation Learning For Dynamic Tactile Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed diffusion models in spectral space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

      <title>Online Monitoring Framework for Automotive Time Series Data using JEPA Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicles are rolled out, measures must be taken to ensure their safe operation. In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.</description>

      <title>Vendi Novelty Scores for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems. Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions. In this work, we introduce a third paradigm and formulate OOD detection from a diversity perspective. We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Object Pose Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07801v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental computer vision problem with broad applications in augmented reality and robotics. Over the past decade, deep learning models, due to their superior accuracy and robustness, have increasingly supplanted conventional algorithms reliant on engineered point pair features. Nevertheless, several challenges persist in contemporary methods, including their dependency on labeled training data, model compactness, robustness under challenging conditions, and their ability to generalize to novel unseen objects. A recent survey discussing the progress made on different aspects of this area, outstanding challenges, and promising future directions, is missing. To fill this gap, we discuss the recent advances in deep learning-based object pose estimation, covering all three formulations of the problem, \emph{i.e.}, instance-level, category-level, and unseen object pose estimation. Our survey also covers multiple input data modalities, degrees-of-freedom of output poses, object properties, and downstream tasks, providing the readers with a holistic understanding of this field. Additionally, it discusses training paradigms of different domains, inference modes, application areas, evaluation metrics, and benchmark datasets, as well as reports the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks, thereby facilitating the readers in selecting the most suitable method for their application. Finally, the survey identifies key challenges, reviews the prevailing trends along with their pros and cons, and identifies promising directions for future research. We also keep tracing the latest works at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/Awesome-Object-Pose-Estimation.</description>

      <title>MpoxSLDNet: A Novel CNN Model for Detecting Monkeypox Lesions and Performance Comparison with Pre-trained Models</title>

Abstract: Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic virus that poses a significant threat to public health, particularly in remote parts of Central and West Africa. Early detection of monkeypox lesions is crucial for effective treatment. However, due to its similarity with other skin diseases, monkeypox lesion detection is a challenging task. To detect monkeypox, many researchers used various deep-learning models such as MobileNetv2, VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB3, MobileNetV2, and Xception. However, these models often require high storage space due to their large size. This study aims to improve the existing challenges by introducing a CNN model named MpoxSLDNet (Monkeypox Skin Lesion Detector Network) to facilitate early detection and categorization of Monkeypox lesions and Non-Monkeypox lesions in digital images. Our model represents a significant advancement in the field of monkeypox lesion detection by offering superior performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC, compared to traditional pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The key novelty of our approach lies in MpoxSLDNet's ability to achieve high detection accuracy while requiring significantly less storage space than existing models. By addressing the challenge of high storage requirements, MpoxSLDNet presents a practical solution for early detection and categorization of monkeypox lesions in resource-constrained healthcare settings. In this study, we have used "Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset" comprising 1428 skin images of monkeypox lesions and 1764 skin images of Non-Monkeypox lesions. Dataset's limitations could potentially impact the model's ability to generalize to unseen cases. However, the MpoxSLDNet model achieved a validation accuracy of 94.56%, compared to 86.25%, 84.38%, and 67.19% for VGG16, DenseNet121, and ResNet50, respectively.</description>

      <title>RS-Agent: Automating Remote Sensing Tasks through Intelligent Agent</title>

Abstract: The unprecedented advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in interacting with humans through both language and visual inputs to perform downstream tasks such as visual question answering and scene understanding. However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering. Our work presents RS-Agent as a robust and extensible framework for advancing intelligent automation in remote sensing analysis.</description>

      <title>Controllable Dance Generation with Style-Guided Motion Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet automatically generating dance sequences is a significant yet challenging endeavor. Existing approaches often neglect the critical aspect of controllability in dance generation. Additionally, they inadequately model the nuanced impact of music styles, resulting in dances that lack alignment with the expressive characteristics inherent in the conditioned music. To address this gap, we propose Style-Guided Motion Diffusion (SGMD), which integrates the Transformer-based architecture with a Style Modulation module. By incorporating music features with user-provided style prompts, the SGMD ensures that the generated dances not only match the musical content but also reflect the desired stylistic characteristics. To enable flexible control over the generated dances, we introduce a spatial-temporal masking mechanism. As controllable dance generation has not been fully studied, we construct corresponding experimental setups and benchmarks for tasks such as trajectory-based dance generation, dance in-betweening, and dance inpainting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic and stylistically consistent dances, while also empowering users to create dances tailored to diverse artistic and practical needs.

      <title>Story-Iter: A Training-free Iterative Paradigm for Long Story Visualization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Story-Iter, a new training-free iterative paradigm to enhance long-story generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed reference images to construct a complete story, our approach features a novel external iterative paradigm, extending beyond the internal iterative denoising steps of diffusion models, to continuously refine each generated image by incorporating all reference images from the previous round. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play, training-free global reference cross-attention (GRCA) module, modeling all reference frames with global embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency in long sequences. By progressively incorporating holistic visual context and text constraints, our iterative paradigm enables precise generation with fine-grained interactions, optimizing the story visualization step-by-step. Extensive experiments in the official story visualization dataset and our long story benchmark demonstrate that Story-Iter's state-of-the-art performance in long-story visualization (up to 100 frames) excels in both semantic consistency and fine-grained interactions.</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Scheduling: A General Framework for Optimizing Diffusion Noise Schedule via Distributional Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12188v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for optimizing noise schedules in diffusion models, applicable to both training and sampling. Our method enforces a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process, where the rate of change is quantified using a user-defined discrepancy measure. We introduce three such measures, which can be flexibly selected or combined depending on the domain and model architecture. While our framework is inspired by theoretical insights, we do not aim to provide a complete theoretical justification of how distributional change affects sample quality. Instead, we focus on establishing a general-purpose scheduling framework and validating its empirical effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance of both pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models, across various datasets, samplers, and a wide range of number of function evaluations from 5 to 250. In particular, when applied to both training and sampling schedules, our method achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.03 on LSUN Horse 256$\times$256, without compromising mode coverage.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Multimodal and Multi-view Alignment for Keystep Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Egocentric videos capture scenes from a wearer's viewpoint, resulting in dynamic backgrounds, frequent motion, and occlusions, posing challenges to accurate keystep recognition. We propose a flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos, and leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos. Our approach consists of constructing a graph where each video clip of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. During training, we consider each clip of each exocentric video (if available) as additional nodes. We examine several strategies to define connections across these nodes and pose keystep recognition as a node classification task on the constructed graphs. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing methods by more than 12 points in accuracy. Furthermore, the constructed graphs are sparse and compute efficient. We also present a study examining on harnessing several multimodal features, including narrations, depth, and object class labels, on a heterogeneous graph and discuss their corresponding contribution to the keystep recognition performance.</description>

      <title>Dual-IPO: Dual-Iterative Preference Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled thrilling experiences in producing realistic videos driven by scalable diffusion transformers. However, they usually fail to produce satisfactory outputs that are aligned to users' authentic demands and preferences. In this work, we introduce Dual-Iterative Optimization (Dual-IPO), an iterative paradigm that sequentially optimizes both the reward model and the video generation model for improved synthesis quality and human preference alignment. For the reward model, our framework ensures reliable and robust reward signals via CoT-guided reasoning, voting-based self-consistency, and preference certainty estimation. Given this, we optimize video foundation models with guidance of signals from reward model's feedback, thus improving the synthesis quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. The reward model and video generation model complement each other and are progressively improved in the multi-round iteration, without requiring tediously manual preference annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dual-IPO can effectively and consistently improve the video generation quality of base model with various architectures and sizes, even help a model with only 2B parameters surpass a 5B one. Moreover, our analysis experiments and ablation studies identify the rational of our systematic design and the efficacy of each component.</description>

      <title>Wandering around: A bioinspired approach to visual attention through object motion sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active vision enables dynamic visual perception, offering an alternative to static feedforward architectures in computer vision, which rely on large datasets and high computational resources. Biological selective attention mechanisms allow agents to focus on salient Regions of Interest (ROIs), reducing computational demand while maintaining real-time responsiveness. Event-based cameras, inspired by the mammalian retina, enhance this capability by capturing asynchronous scene changes enabling efficient low-latency processing. To distinguish moving objects while the event-based camera is in motion the agent requires an object motion segmentation mechanism to accurately detect targets and center them in the visual field (fovea). Integrating event-based sensors with neuromorphic algorithms represents a paradigm shift, using Spiking Neural Networks to parallelize computation and adapt to dynamic environments. This work presents a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network bioinspired attention system for selective attention through object motion sensitivity. The system generates events via fixational eye movements using a Dynamic Vision Sensor integrated into the Speck neuromorphic hardware, mounted on a Pan-Tilt unit, to identify the ROI and saccade toward it. The system, characterized using ideal gratings and benchmarked against the Event Camera Motion Segmentation Dataset, reaches a mean IoU of 82.2% and a mean SSIM of 96% in multi-object motion segmentation. The detection of salient objects reaches 88.8% accuracy in office scenarios and 89.8% in low-light conditions on the Event-Assisted Low-Light Video Object Segmentation Dataset. A real-time demonstrator shows the system's 0.12 s response to dynamic scenes. Its learning-free design ensures robustness across perceptual scenes, making it a reliable foundation for real-time robotic applications serving as a basis for more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning Based on Transformed Image Reconstruction for Equivariance-Coherent Feature Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have achieved remarkable success in learning image representations allowing invariances in them - but therefore discarding transformation information that some computer vision tasks actually require. While recent approaches attempt to address this limitation by learning equivariant features using linear operators in feature space, they impose restrictive assumptions that constrain flexibility and generalization. We introduce a weaker definition for the transformation relation between image and feature space denoted as equivariance-coherence. We propose a novel SSL auxiliary task that learns equivariance-coherent representations through intermediate transformation reconstruction, which can be integrated with existing joint embedding SSL methods. Our key idea is to reconstruct images at intermediate points along transformation paths, e.g. when training on 30-degree rotations, we reconstruct the 10-degree and 20-degree rotation states. Reconstructing intermediate states requires the transformation information used in augmentations, rather than suppressing it, and therefore fosters features containing the augmented transformation information. Our method decomposes feature vectors into invariant and equivariant parts, training them with standard SSL losses and reconstruction losses, respectively. We demonstrate substantial improvements on synthetic equivariance benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks requiring invariant representations. The approach seamlessly integrates with existing SSL methods (iBOT, DINOv2) and consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, including segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and video dense prediction. Our framework provides a practical way for augmenting SSL methods with equivariant capabilities while preserving invariant performance.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.</description>

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, offering superior temporal consistency and visual quality compared to traditional generative adversarial networks-based approaches. While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field. A structured list of related works involved in this survey is also available on https://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Survey-Video-Diffusion.</description>

      <title>Federated EndoViT: Pretraining Vision Transformers via Federated Learning on Endoscopic Image Collections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Data privacy regulations hinder the creation of generalizable foundation models (FMs) for surgery by preventing multi-institutional data aggregation. This study investigates federated learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution to collaboratively train robust surgical FMs. Methods: We introduce Federated EndoViT (FL-EndoViT), a federated framework that validates the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy in a decentralized surgical setting. To ensure convergence under severe data heterogeneity, the architecture integrates adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM). Pretrained on the large-scale Endo700k dataset, FL-EndoViT is evaluated against a centralized baseline on different tasks including scene segmentation, action recognition, and phase recognition. Results: FedSAM is critical for successful pretraining, overcoming the convergence failures of standard federated methods. The resulting FL-EndoViT performs comparably to its centralized counterpart, with significant advantages in data-scarce, high-resolution segmentation and generalization to new surgical events. We also establish that full, end-to-end fine-tuning is necessary for optimal performance. Conclusion: This work validates FL with adaptive optimization as a viable paradigm for creating robust, privacy-preserving surgical FMs. Our findings provide a scalable framework for collaborative Surgical Data Science and underscore the optimizer's critical role in handling data heterogeneity. Future work should explore video-based models to incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>ReaMOT: A Benchmark and Framework for Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking</title>

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track targets specified by language instructions. However, existing RMOT paradigms are largely designed for explicit instructions and consequently fail to generalize to complex instructions that require logical reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT), a novel task that requires models to identify and track targets that satisfy implicit constraints via logical reasoning. To advance this field, we construct the ReaMOT Challenge, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: (1) a large-scale dataset with 1,156 instructions categorized into High-Level Reasoning and Low-Level Perception, covering 423,359 image-language pairs across 869 diverse scenes; and (2) a tailored metric suite designed to jointly evaluate reasoning accuracy and tracking robustness. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework that synergizes the reasoning capabilities of Thinking-variant Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) with the precise temporal modeling of SAM2. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</description>

      <title>UFM: A Simple Path towards Unified Dense Correspondence with Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification. Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &amp; Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence tasks.</description>

      <title>TAMMs: Change Understanding and Forecasting in Satellite Image Time Series with Temporal-Aware Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal Change Description (TCD) and Future Satellite Image Forecasting (FSIF) are critical, yet historically disjointed tasks in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) analysis. Both are fundamentally limited by the common challenge of modeling long-range temporal dynamics. To explore how to improve the performance of methods on both tasks simultaneously by enhancing long-range temporal understanding capabilities, we introduce **TAMMs**, the first unified framework designed to jointly perform TCD and FSIF within a single MLLM-diffusion architecture. TAMMs introduces two key innovations: Temporal Adaptation Modules (**TAM**) enhance frozen MLLM's ability to comprehend long-range dynamics, and Semantic-Fused Control Injection (**SFCI**) mechanism translates this change understanding into fine-grained generative control. This synergistic design makes the understanding from the TCD task to directly inform and improve the consistency of the FSIF task. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialist baselines on both tasks.

      <title>Common Objects Out of Context (COOCo): Investigating Multimodal Context and Semantic Scene Violations in Referential Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To what degree and under what conditions do VLMs rely on scene context when generating references to objects? To address this question, we introduce the $\textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context (COOCo)}$ dataset and conduct experiments on several VLMs under different degrees of scene-object congruency and noise. We find that models leverage scene context adaptively, depending on scene-object semantic relatedness and noise level. Based on these consistent trends across models, we turn to the question of how VLM attention patterns change as a function of target-scene semantic fit, and to what degree these patterns are predictive of categorisation accuracy. We find that successful object categorisation is associated with increased mid-layer attention to the target. We also find a non-monotonic dependency on semantic fit, with attention dropping at moderate fit and increasing for both low and high fit. These results suggest that VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference generation. Dataset and code are available here: $\href{https://github.com/cs-nlp-uu/scenereg}{https://github.com/cs-nlp-uu/scenereg}$.</description>

      <title>Scalable Dynamic Origin-Destination Demand Estimation Enhanced by High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel integrated framework for dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE) in multi-class mesoscopic network models, incorporating high-resolution satellite imagery together with conventional traffic data from local sensors. Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information, we formulate a computational graph-based DODE framework that calibrates dynamic network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts/speeds from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework, we conduct a series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that supplementing traditional data with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance, especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also show the framework's potential for practical deployment on large-scale networks. Sensitivity analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite imagery data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Expert Learning Framework with the State Space Model for Optical and SAR Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image registration is crucial for multi-modal image fusion and applications. However, several challenges limit the performance of existing deep learning-based methods in cross-modal image registration: (i) significant nonlinear radiometric variations between optical and SAR images affect the shared feature learning and matching; (ii) limited textures in images hinder discriminative feature extraction; (iii) the local receptive field of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) restricts the learning of contextual information, while the Transformer can capture long-range global features but with high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-expert learning framework with the State Space Model (ME-SSM) for optical and SAR image registration. Firstly, to improve the registration performance with limited textures, ME-SSM constructs a multi-expert learning framework to capture shared features from multi-modal images. Specifically, it extracts features from various transformations of the input image and employs a learnable soft router to dynamically fuse these features, thereby enriching feature representations and improving registration performance. Secondly, ME-SSM introduces a state space model, Mamba, for feature extraction, which employs a multi-directional cross-scanning strategy to efficiently capture global contextual relationships with linear complexity. ME-SSM can expand the receptive field, enhance image registration accuracy, and avoid incurring high computational costs. Additionally, ME-SSM uses a multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to enhance the multi-scale feature fusion and interaction. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed ME-SSM on optical and SAR image registration.</description>

      <title>Driving as a Diagnostic Tool: Scenario-based Cognitive Assessment in Older Drivers from Driving Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05463v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from naturalistic driving videos, leveraging large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.</description>

      <title>Local Dense Logit Relations for Enhanced Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art logit distillation methods exhibit versatility, simplicity, and efficiency. Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs. Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance. Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships. Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>ERTACache: Error Rectification and Timesteps Adjustment for Efficient Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their inherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a promising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across timesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this work, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and decompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by inaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from error propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we propose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both error types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify reusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a trajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates cache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model. Together, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under aggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video generation benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup while consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the state-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x acceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline fidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

      <title>LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.</description>

      <title>CARINOX: Inference-time Scaling with Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

      <description>arXiv:2509.19713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions. While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact, motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world models for embodied action planning. Our approach combines motion-aware latent world model features with pixel-space features, enabling MoWM to emphasize action-relevant visual details for action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied planning.

      <title>MultiMat: Multimodal Program Synthesis for Procedural Materials using Large Multimodal Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed acyclic graph structure and intermediate states enable a modular, interpretable workflow for interactive appearance modeling. However, creating such graphs remains challenging and typically requires professional training. While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures static correctness while efficiently navigating the program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</description>

      <title>UGround: Towards Unified Visual Grounding with Unrolled Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{&lt;SEG&gt;} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{&lt;SEG&gt;} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{&lt;SEG&gt;} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{&lt;SEG&gt;} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Detection of Road Surface Conditions: A Generalizable Model using Traffic Cameras and Weather Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transportation agencies make critical operational decisions during hazardous weather events, including assessment of road conditions and resource allocation. In this study, machine learning models are developed to provide additional support for the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. Convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on NYSDOT roadside camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. This task draws critically on a robust hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images containing six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, including integration of operational datasets and use of representative and realistic images. The weather-related road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on completely unseen cameras. With operational deployment, this model has the potential to improve spatial and temporal awareness of road surface conditions, which can strengthen decision-making for operations, roadway maintenance, and traveler safety, particularly during winter weather events.</description>

      <title>SNAP: Towards Segmenting Anything in Any Point Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present SNAP (Segment aNything in Any Point cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

      <title>On the Provable Importance of Gradients for Language-Assisted Image Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP; however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework, termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself. Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Suppressing Hallucinations In LVLM Encoders via Bias and Vulnerability Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks. However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code is available at https://github.com/hukcc/SHIELD.</description>

      <title>GenTrack2: An Improved Hybrid Approach for Multi-Object Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24410v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2</description>

      <title>Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video editing-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leakage, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.</description>

      <title>MediRound: Multi-Round Entity-Level Reasoning Segmentation in Medical Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the progress in medical image segmentation, most existing methods remain task-specific and lack interactivity. Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment &amp; Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</description>

      <title>UniFit: Towards Universal Virtual Try-on with MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.</description>

      <title>VLA-Pruner: Temporal-Aware Dual-Level Visual Token Pruning for Efficient Vision-Language-Action Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Not All Pixels Are Equal: Pixel-wise Meta-Learning for Medical Segmentation with Noisy Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, limiting its application in real-world scenarios. Existing methods often directly adapt noisy label learning techniques designed for instance classification, overlooking the pixel-wise heterogeneity in medical segmentation with its spatially and anatomically varying difficulties. Consequently, global assumptions or simple confidence metrics fail to address these local variations, leaving boundary ambiguities unresolved. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</description>

      <title>Temporal Concept Dynamics in Diffusion Models via Prompt-Conditioned Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

      <title>OpenMonoGS-SLAM: Monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Open-set Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a foundational component in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.</description>

      <title>Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</description>

      <title>Residual Decoding: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via History-Aware Residual Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can reason effectively from image-text inputs and perform well in various multimodal tasks. Despite this success, they are affected by language priors and often produce hallucinations. Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Q-DiT4SR: Exploration of Detail-Preserving Diffusion Transformer Quantization for Real-World Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged in Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) to generate high-quality textures, yet their heavy inference burden hinders real-world deployment. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\times$. Our code and models will be available at https://github.com/xunzhang1128/Q-DiT4SR.</description>

      <title>Unified Personalized Reward Model for Vision Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.</description>

      <title>AdaptMMBench: Benchmarking Adaptive Multimodal Reasoning for Mode Selection and Reasoning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.</description>

      <title>ConsisDrive: Identity-Preserving Driving World Models for Video Generation by Instance Mask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving relies on robust models trained on large-scale, high-quality multi-view driving videos. Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

      <title>RAWDet-7: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Object Detection and Description on Quantized RAW Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality &amp; detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing. Dataset &amp; code upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment for Zero-Shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (HCCR) aims to recognize unseen characters by leveraging radical-based semantic compositions. However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving an accuracy of 55.04\% on the ICDAR 2013 dataset ($m=1500$), significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples, achieving 92.41\% accuracy with only one support sample per class.</description>

      <title>Thinking with Geometry: Active Geometry Integration for Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence.

      <title>Cross-Modal Redundancy and the Geometry of Vision-Language Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits for Test-time Scaling of VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between high-fidelity visual quality and low-latency streaming remains a formidable challenge in audio-driven portrait generation. Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks. Notably, our Lite variant achieves an inference speed of 96 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, facilitating ultra-fast interaction without sacrificing visual coherence.</description>

Abstract: Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of "visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

      <title>WristMIR: Coarse-to-Fine Region-Aware Retrieval of Pediatric Wrist Radiographs with Radiology Report-Driven Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieving wrist radiographs with analogous fracture patterns is challenging because clinically important cues are subtle, highly localized and often obscured by overlapping anatomy or variable imaging views. Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

      <title>Efficient-SAM2: Accelerating SAM2 with Object-Aware Visual Encoding and Memory Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) shows excellent performance in video object segmentation tasks; however, the heavy computational burden hinders its application in real-time video processing. Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.</description>

      <title>E-VAds: An E-commerce Short Videos Understanding Benchmark for MLLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce short videos represent a high-revenue segment of the online video industry characterized by a goal-driven format and dense multi-modal signals. Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a multi-modal information density assessment framework to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds), which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&amp;A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop E-VAds-R1, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called MG-GRPO. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.</description>

      <title>Understanding Image2Video Domain Shift in Food Segmentation: An Instance-level Analysis on Apples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Food segmentation models trained on static images have achieved strong performance on benchmark datasets; however, their reliability in video settings remains poorly understood. In real-world applications such as food monitoring and instance counting, segmentation outputs must be temporally consistent, yet image-trained models often break down when deployed on videos. In this work, we analyze this failure through an instance segmentation and tracking perspective, focusing on apples as a representative food category. Models are trained solely on image-level food segmentation data and evaluated on video sequences using an instance segmentation with tracking-by-matching framework, enabling object-level temporal analysis. Our results reveal that high frame-wise segmentation accuracy does not translate to stable instance identities over time. Temporal appearance variations, particularly illumination changes, specular reflections, and texture ambiguity, lead to mask flickering and identity fragmentation, resulting in significant errors in apple counting. These failures are largely overlooked by conventional image-based metrics, which substantially overestimate real-world video performance. Beyond diagnosing the problem, we examine practical remedies that do not require full video supervision, including post-hoc temporal regularization and self-supervised temporal consistency objectives. Our findings suggest that the root cause of failure lies in image-centric training objectives that ignore temporal coherence, rather than model capacity. This study highlights a critical evaluation gap in food segmentation research and motivates temporally-aware learning and evaluation protocols for video-based food analysis.</description>

      <title>Automatic regularization parameter choice for tomography using a double model approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image reconstruction in X-ray tomography is an ill-posed inverse problem, particularly with limited available data. Regularization is thus essential, but its effectiveness hinges on the choice of a regularization parameter that balances data fidelity against a priori information. We present a novel method for automatic parameter selection based on the use of two distinct computational discretizations of the same problem. A feedback control algorithm dynamically adjusts the regularization strength, driving an iterative reconstruction toward the smallest parameter that yields sufficient similarity between reconstructions on the two grids. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using real tomographic data.</description>

      <title>ALIVE: Animate Your World with Lifelike Audio-Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video generation is rapidly evolving towards unified audio-video generation. In this paper, we present ALIVE, a generation model that adapts a pretrained Text-to-Video (T2V) model to Sora-style audio-video generation and animation. In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&amp;Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&amp;Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. With detailed recipes and benchmarks, we hope ALIVE helps the community develop audio-video generation models more efficiently. Official page: https://github.com/FoundationVision/Alive.</description>

      <title>From Correspondence to Actions: Human-Like Multi-Image Spatial Reasoning in Multi-modal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made substantial progress in single-image spatial reasoning, multi-image spatial reasoning, which requires integration of information from multiple viewpoints, remains challenging. Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Shifting the Breaking Point of Flow Matching for Multi-Instance Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow matching models have recently emerged as an efficient alternative to diffusion, especially for text-guided image generation and editing, offering faster inference through continuous-time dynamics. However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing.</description>

      <title>MOVA: Towards Scalable and Synchronized Video-Audio Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio is indispensable for real-world video, yet generation models have largely overlooked audio components. Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement.</description>

      <title>Grow with the Flow: 4D Reconstruction of Growing Plants with Gaussian Flow Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the time-varying 3D appearance of plants during their growth poses unique challenges: unlike many dynamic scenes, plants generate new geometry over time as they expand, branch, and differentiate. Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.</description>

      <title>DiffBreak: Is Diffusion-Based Purification Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16598v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) has become a cornerstone defense against adversarial examples (AEs), regarded as robust due to its use of diffusion models (DMs) that project AEs onto the natural data manifold. We refute this core claim, theoretically proving that gradient-based attacks effectively target the DM rather than the classifier, causing DBP's outputs to align with adversarial distributions. This prompts a reassessment of DBP's robustness, attributing it to two critical flaws: incorrect gradients and inappropriate evaluation protocols that test only a single random purification of the AE. We show that with proper accounting for stochasticity and resubmission risk, DBP collapses. To support this, we introduce DiffBreak, the first reliable toolkit for differentiation through DBP, eliminating gradient flaws that previously further inflated robustness estimates. We also analyze the current defense scheme used for DBP where classification relies on a single purification, pinpointing its inherent invalidity. We provide a statistically grounded majority-vote (MV) alternative that aggregates predictions across multiple purified copies, showing partial but meaningful robustness gain. We then propose a novel adaptation of an optimization method against deepfake watermarking, crafting systemic perturbations that defeat DBP even under MV, challenging DBP's viability.</description>

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare systems offer significant potential for improving healthcare delivery in humanitarian and resource-constrained environments, providing essential services to underserved populations in remote areas. However, limited network infrastructure in such regions makes reliable communication challenging for traditional IoT systems. This paper presents a real-time chest X-ray decision support system designed for hospitals in remote locations. The proposed system integrates a fine-tuned ResNet50 deep learning model for disease classification with Fast DDS real-time middleware to ensure reliable and low-latency communication between healthcare practitioners and the inference system. Experimental results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 88.61%, precision of 88.76%, and recall of 88.49%. The system attains an average throughput of 3.2 KB/s and an average latency of 65 ms, demonstrating its suitability for deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments. These results highlight the effectiveness of DDS-based middleware in enabling real-time medical decision support for remote healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Ice-FMBench: A Foundation Model Benchmark for Sea Ice Type Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation and mapping of sea ice types is crucial for safe polar navigation, offshore operations, and climate monitoring. While deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for automating sea ice type segmentation, its success often relies on access to extensive expert labeled datasets, which is both resource intensive and time consuming to create. However, foundation models (FMs), recently developed through self-supervised training on large-scale datasets, have demonstrated impressive performance. Nevertheless, their applicability to sea ice type segmentation based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery remains uncertain due to the unique challenges posed by sea ice such as intricate geophysical patterns, pronounced seasonal variability, and SAR-specific artifacts like banding, scalloping, and heterogeneous backscatter as well as the fact that SAR data in polar regions are often acquired using specialized sensor modes that differ markedly from those used to collect FM training data at lower latitudes, limiting their direct transferability to polar environments. To address this gap, we contribute: (1) IceFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluation of the state-of-the-art remote sensing FMs on the sea ice type segmentation task using Sentinel1 SAR imagery, where IceFMBench is composed of a widely used standardized dataset, diverse evaluation metrics, and a representative set of selected remote sensing FM models suitable for sea ice type segmentation, with the ability to include new models side by side the existing models; (2) an extensive comparative evaluation of the representative FMs using IceFMBench, with additional case studies to assess performance of the top-performing model in terms of transferability across temporal and spatial domains and (3) a multi teacher knowledge distillation approach to address lack of spatiotemporal transferability.</description>

      <title>SIMSHIFT: A Benchmark for Adapting Neural Surrogates to Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer significant performance degradation when evaluated on problem configurations outside their training distribution, such as new initial conditions or structural dimensions. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques have been widely used in vision and language to generalize across domains without additional labeled data, their application to complex engineering simulations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap through two focused contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks spanning diverse processes and physics: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established UDA methods to state-of-the-art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out-of-distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of UDA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

      <title>STELAR-VISION: Self-Topology-Aware Efficient Learning for Aligned Reasoning in Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08688v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning, which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H, STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3% higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently outperforms across all OOD benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/lokali/PersonaX.</description>

      <title>From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</description>

      <title>Free-Boundary Quasiconformal Maps via a Least-squares Operator in Diffeomorphism Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization, an important and widely occurring task in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and biological imaging, requires simultaneously determining a planar target domain and a locally bijective map with well-controlled distortion. We formulate this task through the least-squares quasiconformal (LSQC) operator and establish key structural properties of the LSQC minimizer, including well-posedness under mild conditions, invariance under similarity transformations, and resolution-independent behavior with stability under mesh refinement. We further analyze the sensitivity of the LSQC solution with respect to the Beltrami coefficient, establishing stability and differentiability properties that enable gradient-based optimization over the space of Beltrami coefficients. To make this differentiable formulation practical at scale and to facilitate the optimization process, we introduce the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), a multiscale mesh-spectral surrogate that approximates the LSQC solution operator in a single differentiable forward pass. This yields SBN-Opt, an optimization framework that searches over admissible Beltrami coefficients and pinning conditions to solve free-boundary diffeomorphism objectives with explicit distortion control. Extensive experiments on equiareal parameterization and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Toward Efficient and Robust Behavior Models for Multi-Agent Driving Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable multi-agent driving simulation requires behavior models that are both realistic and computationally efficient. We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Modified TSception for Analyzing Driver Drowsiness and Mental Workload from EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driver drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic accidents, necessitating real-time, reliable detection systems to ensure road safety. This study proposes a Modified TSception architecture for robust assessment of driver fatigue and mental workload using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a five-layer hierarchical temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics, surpassing the original TSception's three-layer approach. Key innovations include the use of Adaptive Average Pooling (ADP) for structural flexibility across varying EEG dimensions and a two-stage fusion mechanism to optimize spatiotemporal feature integration for improved stability. Evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset, the Modified TSception achieves 83.46% accuracy, comparable to the original model (83.15%), but with a significantly reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), indicating better performance stability. The architecture's generalizability was further validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 95.93% and 95.35% for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These results show that the proposed modifications improve consistency and cross-task generalizability, making the model a reliable framework for EEG-based safety monitoring.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models through Anisotropy of the Log-Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based image generative models produce high-fidelity images through iterative denoising but remain vulnerable to memorization, where they unintentionally reproduce exact copies or parts of training images. Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by utilizing a mitigation strategy that adapts memorized prompts based on our developed metric.

      <title>EchoJEPA: A Latent Predictive Foundation Model for Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for echocardiography often struggle to disentangle anatomical signal from the stochastic speckle and acquisition artifacts inherent to ultrasound. We present EchoJEPA, a foundation model trained on 18 million echocardiograms across 300K patients, representing the largest pretraining corpus for this modality to date. By leveraging a latent predictive objective, EchoJEPA learns robust anatomical representations that ignore speckle noise. We validate this using a novel multi-view probing framework with frozen backbones, where EchoJEPA outperforms leading baselines by approximately 20% in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) estimation and 17% in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) estimation. The model also exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, reaching 79% view classification accuracy with only 1% of labeled data versus 42% for the best baseline trained on 100%. Crucially, EchoJEPA demonstrates superior generalization, degrading by only 2% under physics-informed acoustic perturbations compared to 17% for competitors. Most remarkably, its zero-shot performance on pediatric patients surpasses fully fine-tuned baselines, establishing latent prediction as a superior paradigm for robust, generalizable medical AI.</description>

      <title>Designing Multi-Robot Ground Video Sensemaking with Public Safety Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Videos from fleets of ground robots can advance public safety by providing scalable situational awareness and reducing professionals' burden. Yet little is known about how to design and integrate multi-robot videos into public safety workflows. Collaborating with six police agencies, we examined how such videos could be made practical. In Study 1, we presented the first testbed for multi-robot ground video sensemaking. The testbed includes 38 events-of-interest (EoI) relevant to public safety, a dataset of 20 robot patrol videos (10 day/night pairs) covering EoI types, and 6 design requirements aimed at improving current video sensemaking practices. In Study 2, we built MRVS, a tool that augments multi-robot patrol video streams with a prompt-engineered video understanding model. Participants reported reduced manual workload and greater confidence with LLM-based explanations, while noting concerns about false alarms and privacy. We conclude with implications for designing future multi-robot video sensemaking tools.</description>

      <title>GEBench: Benchmarking Image Generation Models as GUI Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.
