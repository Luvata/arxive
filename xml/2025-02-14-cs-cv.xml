      <title>Movie Weaver: Tuning-Free Multi-Concept Video Personalization with Anchored Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video personalization, which generates customized videos using reference images, has gained significant attention. However, prior methods typically focus on single-concept personalization, limiting broader applications that require multi-concept integration. Attempts to extend these models to multiple concepts often lead to identity blending, which results in composite characters with fused attributes from multiple sources. This challenge arises due to the lack of a mechanism to link each concept with its specific reference image. We address this with anchored prompts, which embed image anchors as unique tokens within text prompts, guiding accurate referencing during generation. Additionally, we introduce concept embeddings to encode the order of reference images. Our approach, Movie Weaver, seamlessly weaves multiple concepts-including face, body, and animal images-into one video, allowing flexible combinations in a single model. The evaluation shows that Movie Weaver outperforms existing methods for multi-concept video personalization in identity preservation and overall quality.</description>

      <title>CrossVideoMAE: Self-Supervised Image-Video Representation Learning with Masked Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video-based Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) primarily focus on learning effective spatiotemporal representations from a visual perspective, which may lead the model to prioritize general spatial-temporal patterns but often overlook nuanced semantic attributes like specific interactions or sequences that define actions - such as action-specific features that align more closely with human cognition for space-time correspondence. This can limit the model's ability to capture the essence of certain actions that are contextually rich and continuous. Humans are capable of mapping visual concepts, object view invariance, and semantic attributes available in static instances to comprehend natural dynamic scenes or videos. Existing MAEs for videos and static images rely on separate datasets for videos and images, which may lack the rich semantic attributes necessary for fully understanding the learned concepts, especially when compared to using video and corresponding sampled frame images together. To this end, we propose CrossVideoMAE an end-to-end self-supervised cross-modal contrastive learning MAE that effectively learns both video-level and frame-level rich spatiotemporal representations and semantic attributes. Our method integrates mutual spatiotemporal information from videos with spatial information from sampled frames within a feature-invariant space, while encouraging invariance to augmentations within the video domain. This objective is achieved through jointly embedding features of visible tokens and combining feature correspondence within and across modalities, which is critical for acquiring rich, label-free guiding signals from both video and frame image modalities in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation of Latent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative framework for Unsupervised Image Dehazing via Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformation, termed UID-KAT. Image dehazing is recognized as a challenging and ill-posed vision task that requires complex transformations and interpretations in the feature space. Recent advancements have introduced Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) since KANs can leverage their polynomial foundation to more efficiently approximate complex functions while requiring fewer layers than MLPs. Motivated by this potential, this paper explores the use of KANs combined with adversarial training and contrastive learning to model the intricate relationship between hazy and clear images. Adversarial training is employed due to its capacity in producing high-fidelity images, and contrastive learning promotes the model's emphasis on significant features while suppressing the influence of irrelevant information. The proposed UID-KAT framework is trained in an unsupervised setting to take advantage of the abundance of real-world data and address the challenge of preparing paired hazy/clean images. Experimental results show that UID-KAT achieves state-of-the-art dehazing performance across multiple datasets and scenarios, outperforming existing unpaired methods while reducing model complexity.

      <title>Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher success rates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is actively being conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks that target only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixel attacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglect the fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in the field of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-based black-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using Reinforcement Learning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forget processes. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency by leveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels. RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scores while adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposed attack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reduces the confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformed state-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCO dataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAP reduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Further experiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAR effectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/KAU-QuantumAILab/RFPAR.</description>

      <title>PDM-SSD: Single-Stage Three-Dimensional Object Detector With Point Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Point-based detectors can only learn from the provided points, with limited receptive fields and insufficient global learning capabilities for such targets. In this paper, we present a novel Point Dilation Mechanism for single-stage 3D detection (PDM-SSD) that takes advantage of these two representations. Specifically, we first use a PointNet-style 3D backbone for efficient feature encoding. Then, a neck with Point Dilation Mechanism (PDM) is used to expand the feature space, which involves two key steps: point dilation and feature filling. The former expands points to a certain size grid centered around the sampled points in Euclidean space. The latter fills the unoccupied grid with feature for backpropagation using spherical harmonic coefficients and Gaussian density function in terms of direction and scale. Next, we associate multiple dilation centers and fuse coefficients to obtain sparse grid features through height compression. Finally, we design a hybrid detection head for joint learning, where on one hand, the scene heatmap is predicted to complement the voting point set for improved detection accuracy, and on the other hand, the target probability of detected boxes are calibrated through feature fusion. On the challenging Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute (KITTI) dataset, PDM-SSD achieves state-of-the-art results for multi-class detection among single-modal methods with an inference speed of 68 frames. We also demonstrate the advantages of PDM-SSD in detecting sparse and incomplete objects through numerous object-level instances. Additionally, PDM can serve as an auxiliary network to establish a connection between sampling points and object centers, thereby improving the accuracy of the model without sacrificing inference speed. Our code will be available at https://github.com/AlanLiangC/PDM-SSD.git.</description>

      <title>Pre-Trained Video Generative Models as World Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generative models pre-trained on large-scale internet datasets have achieved remarkable success, excelling at producing realistic synthetic videos. However, they often generate clips based on static prompts (e.g., text or images), limiting their ability to model interactive and dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic World Simulation (DWS), a novel approach to transform pre-trained video generative models into controllable world simulators capable of executing specified action trajectories. To achieve precise alignment between conditioned actions and generated visual changes, we introduce a lightweight, universal action-conditioned module that seamlessly integrates into any existing model. Instead of focusing on complex visual details, we demonstrate that consistent dynamic transition modeling is the key to building powerful world simulators. Building upon this insight, we further introduce a motion-reinforced loss that enhances action controllability by compelling the model to capture dynamic changes more effectively. Experiments demonstrate that DWS can be versatilely applied to both diffusion and autoregressive transformer models, achieving significant improvements in generating action-controllable, dynamically consistent videos across games and robotics domains. Moreover, to facilitate the applications of the learned world simulator in downstream tasks such as model-based reinforcement learning, we propose prioritized imagination to improve sample efficiency, demonstrating competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, power line maintenance has seen a paradigm shift by moving towards computer vision-powered automated inspection. The utilization of an extensive collection of videos and images has become essential for maintaining the reliability, safety, and sustainability of electricity transmission. A significant focus on applying deep learning techniques for enhancing power line inspection processes has been observed in recent research. A comprehensive review of existing studies has been conducted in this paper, to aid researchers and industries in developing improved deep learning-based systems for analyzing power line data. The conventional steps of data analysis in power line inspections have been examined, and the body of current research has been systematically categorized into two main areas: the detection of components and the diagnosis of faults. A detailed summary of the diverse methods and techniques employed in these areas has been encapsulated, providing insights into their functionality and use cases. Special attention has been given to the exploration of deep learning-based methodologies for the analysis of power line inspection data, with an exposition of their fundamental principles and practical applications. Moreover, a vision for future research directions has been outlined, highlighting the need for advancements such as edge-cloud collaboration, and multi-modal analysis among others. Thus, this paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers delving into deep learning for power line analysis, illuminating the extent of current knowledge and the potential areas for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Preference Alignment on Diffusion Model: A Comprehensive Survey for Image Generation and Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of preference alignment with diffusion models (DMs) has emerged as a transformative approach to enhance image generation and editing capabilities. Although integrating diffusion models with preference alignment strategies poses significant challenges for novices at this intersection, comprehensive and systematic reviews of this subject are still notably lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper extensively surveys preference alignment with diffusion models in image generation and editing. First, we systematically review cutting-edge optimization techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), and others, highlighting their pivotal role in aligning preferences with DMs. Then, we thoroughly explore the applications of aligning preferences with DMs in autonomous driving, medical imaging, robotics, and more. Finally, we comprehensively discuss the challenges of preference alignment with DMs. To our knowledge, this is the first survey centered on preference alignment with DMs, providing insights to drive future innovation in this dynamic area.</description>

      <title>Captured by Captions: On Memorization and its Mitigation in CLIP Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in aligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image retrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by which these models utilize training data, particularly the role of memorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and self-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for generalization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would apply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via captions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from self-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in understanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem) and use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that CLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised paradigms, with "mis-captioned" samples exhibiting highest levels of memorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to memorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies should focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose multiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving utility--something that had not been shown before for traditional learning paradigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease.</description>

      <title>NanoVLMs: How small can we go and still make coherent Vision Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V and Llama 3.2 vision, have garnered significant research attention for their ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks. However, their potential is constrained by inherent challenges, including proprietary restrictions, substantial computational demands, and limited accessibility. Smaller models, such as GIT and BLIP, exhibit marked limitations, often failing to generate coherent and consistent text beyond a few tokens, even with extensive training. This underscores a pivotal inquiry: how small can a VLM be and still produce fluent and consistent text? Drawing inspiration from the exceptional learning process of 3-4 year old children, who rely heavily on visual cues for understanding and communication, we introduce two novel datasets: ShortDesc (featuring concise image descriptions) and LongDesc (containing more detailed image descriptions). These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text is restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young children, generated with a scaled- down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller, up to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining architectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade the text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and consistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of standard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a multidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute to the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource constrained environments.</description>

      <title>TranSplat: Surface Embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transparent Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent object manipulation remains a sig- nificant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications. We open-source synthetic dataset and model: https://github. com/jeongyun0609/TranSplat</description>

      <title>Spread them Apart: Towards Robust Watermarking of Generated Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models that can produce realistic images have improved significantly in recent years. The quality of the generated content has increased drastically, so sometimes it is very difficult to distinguish between the real images and the generated ones. Such an improvement comes at a price of ethical concerns about the usage of the generative models: the users of generative models can improperly claim ownership of the generated content protected by a license. In this paper, we propose an approach to embed watermarks into the generated content to allow future detection of the generated content and identification of the user who generated it. The watermark is embedded during the inference of the model, so the proposed approach does not require the retraining of the latter. We prove that watermarks embedded are guaranteed to be robust against additive perturbations of a bounded magnitude. We apply our method to watermark diffusion models and show that it matches state-of-the-art watermarking schemes in terms of robustness to different types of synthetic watermark removal attacks.</description>

      <title>Technical note on calibrating vision-language models under covariate shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being a successful example of emerging capability, vision-language foundation models for low-shot vision classification have a limited ability to sufficiently generalize to the target data distribution due to sample poverty, leading to sensitivity to variations in the data. A popular mitigation strategy is finetuning over multiple datasets, but domain generalization is expensive when practiced in this manner. This work examines both covariate shift between pre-training data and the underspecified target data, and \textit{confidence misalignment}, where the model's prediction confidence amplified by the limited data availability. We propose \textit{Confidence-Calibrated Covariate Shift Correction ($C3SC$)}, a unified framework to mitigate both covariate shift and confidence misalignment. $C3SC$ leverages Fisher information penalty for covariate shift correction and confidence misalignment penalty (CMP) to lower confidence on misclassified examples. Experimental results across various vision and covariate shift datasets demonstrates that $C3SC$ significantly improves in calibration (ECE) by $5.82\%$ at maximum. $C3SC$ shows better robustness as well by showing $3.5\%$ improvement in accuracy metric on challenging covariate shift datasets, making $C3SC$ a promising solution for reliable real-world vision-language low-shot applications under distribution shift.</description>

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) combine visual understanding with natural language processing, enabling tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and video analysis. While VLMs show impressive capabilities across domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart surveillance, and healthcare, their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to processing power, memory, and energy limitations. This survey explores recent advancements in optimizing VLMs for edge environments, focusing on model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and specialized hardware solutions that enhance efficiency. We provide a detailed discussion of efficient training and fine-tuning methods, edge deployment challenges, and privacy considerations. Additionally, we discuss the diverse applications of lightweight VLMs across healthcare, environmental monitoring, and autonomous systems, illustrating their growing impact. By highlighting key design strategies, current challenges, and offering recommendations for future directions, this survey aims to inspire further research into the practical deployment of VLMs, ultimately making advanced AI accessible in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>MRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</description>

      <title>EventEgo3D++: 3D Human Motion Capture from a Head-Mounted Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular egocentric 3D human motion capture remains a significant challenge, particularly under conditions of low lighting and fast movements, which are common in head-mounted device applications. Existing methods that rely on RGB cameras often fail under these conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce EventEgo3D++, the first approach that leverages a monocular event camera with a fisheye lens for 3D human motion capture. Event cameras excel in high-speed scenarios and varying illumination due to their high temporal resolution, providing reliable cues for accurate 3D human motion capture. EventEgo3D++ leverages the LNES representation of event streams to enable precise 3D reconstructions. We have also developed a mobile head-mounted device (HMD) prototype equipped with an event camera, capturing a comprehensive dataset that includes real event observations from both controlled studio environments and in-the-wild settings, in addition to a synthetic dataset. Additionally, to provide a more holistic dataset, we include allocentric RGB streams that offer different perspectives of the HMD wearer, along with their corresponding SMPL body model. Our experiments demonstrate that EventEgo3D++ achieves superior 3D accuracy and robustness compared to existing solutions, even in challenging conditions. Moreover, our method supports real-time 3D pose updates at a rate of 140Hz. This work is an extension of the EventEgo3D approach (CVPR 2024) and further advances the state of the art in egocentric 3D human motion capture.

      <title>TextAtlas5M: A Large-scale Dataset for Dense Text Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.</description>

      <title>DeepSeek on a Trip: Inducing Targeted Visual Hallucinations via Representation Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) represent the cutting edge of AI technology, with DeepSeek models emerging as a leading open-source alternative offering competitive performance to closed-source systems. While these models demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their vision-language integration mechanisms introduce specific vulnerabilities. We implement an adapted embedding manipulation attack on DeepSeek Janus that induces targeted visual hallucinations through systematic optimization of image embeddings. Through extensive experimentation across COCO, DALL-E 3, and SVIT datasets, we achieve hallucination rates of up to 98.0% while maintaining high visual fidelity (SSIM &gt; 0.88) of the manipulated images on open-ended questions. Our analysis demonstrates that both 1B and 7B variants of DeepSeek Janus are susceptible to these attacks, with closed-form evaluation showing consistently higher hallucination rates compared to open-ended questioning. We introduce a novel multi-prompt hallucination detection framework using LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct for robust evaluation. The implications of these findings are particularly concerning given DeepSeek's open-source nature and widespread deployment potential. This research emphasizes the critical need for embedding-level security measures in MLLM deployment pipelines and contributes to the broader discussion of responsible AI implementation.</description>

      <title>SurGrID: Controllable Surgical Simulation via Scene Graph to Image Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical simulation offers a promising addition to conventional surgical training. However, available simulation tools lack photorealism and rely on hardcoded behaviour. Denoising Diffusion Models are a promising alternative for high-fidelity image synthesis, but existing state-of-the-art conditioning methods fall short in providing precise control or interactivity over the generated scenes.
  We introduce SurGrID, a Scene Graph to Image Diffusion Model, allowing for controllable surgical scene synthesis by leveraging Scene Graphs. These graphs encode a surgical scene's components' spatial and semantic information, which are then translated into an intermediate representation using our novel pre-training step that explicitly captures local and global information.
  Our proposed method improves the fidelity of generated images and their coherence with the graph input over the state-of-the-art. Further, we demonstrate the simulation's realism and controllability in a user assessment study involving clinical experts.
  Scene Graphs can be effectively used for precise and interactive conditioning of Denoising Diffusion Models for simulating surgical scenes, enabling high fidelity and interactive control over the generated content.</description>

      <title>Federated Self-supervised Domain Generalization for Label-efficient Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies assumes par-amount significance in handling unlabeled polyp datasets when building deep learning-based automatic polyp segmentation models. However, the intricate privacy dynamics surrounding medical data often preclude seamless data sharing among disparate medical centers. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a formidable solution to this privacy conundrum, yet within the realm of FL, optimizing model generalization stands as a pressing imperative. Robust generalization capabilities are imperative to ensure the model's efficacy across diverse geographical domains post-training on localized client datasets. In this paper, a Federated self-supervised Domain Generalization method is proposed to enhance the generalization capacity of federated and Label-efficient intestinal polyp segmentation, named LFDG. Based on a classical SSL method, DropPos, LFDG proposes an adversarial learning-based data augmentation method (SSADA) to enhance the data diversity. LFDG further proposes a relaxation module based on Source-reconstruction and Augmentation-masking (SRAM) to maintain stability in feature learning. We have validated LFDG on polyp images from six medical centers. The performance of our method achieves 3.80% and 3.92% better than the baseline and other recent FL methods and SSL methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Joint Modelling Histology and Molecular Markers for Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancers are characterized by remarkable heterogeneity and diverse prognosis. Accurate cancer classification is essential for patient stratification and clinical decision-making. Although digital pathology has been advancing cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the paradigm in cancer pathology has shifted from purely relying on histology features to incorporating molecular markers. There is an urgent need for digital pathology methods to meet the needs of the new paradigm. We introduce a novel digital pathology approach to jointly predict molecular markers and histology features and model their interactions for cancer classification. Firstly, to mitigate the challenge of cross-magnification information propagation, we propose a multi-scale disentangling module, enabling the extraction of multi-scale features from high-magnification (cellular-level) to low-magnification (tissue-level) whole slide images. Further, based on the multi-scale features, we propose an attention-based hierarchical multi-task multi-instance learning framework to simultaneously predict histology and molecular markers. Moreover, we propose a co-occurrence probability-based label correlation graph network to model the co-occurrence of molecular markers. Lastly, we design a cross-modal interaction module with the dynamic confidence constrain loss and a cross-modal gradient modulation strategy, to model the interactions of histology and molecular markers. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in classifying glioma, histology features and molecular markers. Our method promises to promote precise oncology with the potential to advance biomedical research and clinical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/LHY1007/M3C2</description>

      <title>From Brainwaves to Brain Scans: A Robust Neural Network for EEG-to-fMRI Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers rich spatial resolution, it is limited by high operational costs and significant infrastructural demands. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) provides millisecond-level precision in capturing electrical activity but lacks the spatial resolution necessary for precise neural localization. To bridge these gaps, we introduce E2fNet, a simple yet effective deep learning model for synthesizing fMRI images from low-cost EEG data. E2fNet is specifically designed to capture and translate meaningful features from EEG across electrode channels into accurate fMRI representations. Extensive evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that E2fNet consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the structural similarity index measure (SSIM). Our findings suggest that E2fNet is a promising, cost-effective solution for enhancing neuroimaging capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kgr20/E2fNet.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Swapping via Learning and Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Knowledge Swapping}, a novel task designed to selectively regulate knowledge of a pretrained model by enabling the forgetting of user\-specified information, retaining essential knowledge, and acquiring new knowledge simultaneously. By delving into the analysis of knock-on feature hierarchy, we find that incremental learning typically progresses from low\-level representations to higher\-level semantics, whereas forgetting tends to occur in the opposite direction\-starting from high-level semantics and moving down to low-level features. Building upon this, we propose to benchmark the knowledge swapping task with the strategy of \textit{Learning Before Forgetting}. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}{https://github.com/xingmingyu123456/KnowledgeSwapping}.</description>

      <title>MAA: Meticulous Adversarial Attack against Vision-Language Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current adversarial attacks for evaluating the robustness of vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models in multi-modal tasks suffer from limited transferability, where attacks crafted for a specific model often struggle to generalize effectively across different models, limiting their utility in assessing robustness more broadly. This is mainly attributed to the over-reliance on model-specific features and regions, particularly in the image modality. In this paper, we propose an elegant yet highly effective method termed Meticulous Adversarial Attack (MAA) to fully exploit model-independent characteristics and vulnerabilities of individual samples, achieving enhanced generalizability and reduced model dependence. MAA emphasizes fine-grained optimization of adversarial images by developing a novel resizing and sliding crop (RScrop) technique, incorporating a multi-granularity similarity disruption (MGSD) strategy. Extensive experiments across diverse VLP models, multiple benchmark datasets, and a variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MAA significantly enhances the effectiveness and transferability of adversarial attacks. A large cohort of performance studies is conducted to generate insights into the effectiveness of various model configurations, guiding future advancements in this domain.</description>

      <title>ID-Cloak: Crafting Identity-Specific Cloaks Against Personalized Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models allow users to generate images of new concepts from several reference photos, thereby leading to critical concerns regarding civil privacy. Although several anti-personalization techniques have been developed, these methods typically assume that defenders can afford to design a privacy cloak corresponding to each specific image. However, due to extensive personal images shared online, image-specific methods are limited by real-world practical applications. To address this issue, we are the first to investigate the creation of identity-specific cloaks (ID-Cloak) that safeguard all images belong to a specific identity. Specifically, we first model an identity subspace that preserves personal commonalities and learns diverse contexts to capture the image distribution to be protected. Then, we craft identity-specific cloaks with the proposed novel objective that encourages the cloak to guide the model away from its normal output within the subspace. Extensive experiments show that the generated universal cloak can effectively protect the images. We believe our method, along with the proposed identity-specific cloak setting, marks a notable advance in realistic privacy protection.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Data Curation for Visual Contrastive Learning: Why Crafting Effective Positive and Negative Pairs Matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual contrastive learning aims to learn representations by contrasting similar (positive) and dissimilar (negative) pairs of data samples. The design of these pairs significantly impacts representation quality, training efficiency, and computational cost. A well-curated set of pairs leads to stronger representations and faster convergence. As contrastive pre-training sees wider adoption for solving downstream tasks, data curation becomes essential for optimizing its effectiveness. In this survey, we attempt to create a taxonomy of existing techniques for positive and negative pair curation in contrastive learning, and describe them in detail.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Complex Hermit Positive Definite Convolution Network for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning can learn high-level semantic features in Euclidean space effectively for PolSAR images, while they need to covert the complex covariance matrix into a feature vector or complex-valued vector as the network input. However, the complex covariance matrices are essentially a complex Hermit positive definite (HPD) matrix endowed in Riemannian manifold rather than Euclidean space. The matrix's real and imagery parts are with the same significance, as the imagery part represents the phase information. The matrix vectorization will destroy the geometric structure and manifold characteristics of complex covariance matrices. To learn complex HPD matrices directly, we propose a Riemannian complex HPD convolution network(HPD\_CNN) for PolSAR images. This method consists of a complex HPD unfolding network(HPDnet) and a CV-3DCNN enhanced network. The proposed complex HPDnet defines the HPD mapping, rectifying and the logEig layers to learn geometric features of complex matrices. In addition, a fast eigenvalue decomposition method is designed to reduce computation burden. Finally, a Riemannian-to-Euclidean enhanced network is defined to enhance contextual information for classification. Experimental results on two real PolSSAR datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods especially in heterogeneous regions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Class Discovery in Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CoDynTrust: Robust Asynchronous Collaborative Perception via Dynamic Feature Trust Modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception, fusing information from multiple agents, can extend perception range so as to improve perception performance. However, temporal asynchrony in real-world environments, caused by communication delays, clock misalignment, or sampling configuration differences, can lead to information mismatches. If this is not well handled, then the collaborative performance is patchy, and what's worse safety accidents may occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose CoDynTrust, an uncertainty-encoded asynchronous fusion perception framework that is robust to the information mismatches caused by temporal asynchrony. CoDynTrust generates dynamic feature trust modulus (DFTM) for each region of interest by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty as well as selectively suppressing or retaining single-vehicle features, thereby mitigating information mismatches. We then design a multi-scale fusion module to handle multi-scale feature maps processed by DFTM. Compared to existing works that also consider asynchronous collaborative perception, CoDynTrust combats various low-quality information in temporally asynchronous scenarios and allows uncertainty to be propagated to downstream tasks such as planning and control. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDynTrust significantly reduces performance degradation caused by temporal asynchrony across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance even with temporal asynchrony.

      <title>AnyCharV: Bootstrap Controllable Character Video Generation with Fine-to-Coarse Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Character video generation is a significant real-world application focused on producing high-quality videos featuring specific characters. Recent advancements have introduced various control signals to animate static characters, successfully enhancing control over the generation process. However, these methods often lack flexibility, limiting their applicability and making it challenging for users to synthesize a source character into a desired target scene. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, AnyCharV, that flexibly generates character videos using arbitrary source characters and target scenes, guided by pose information. Our approach involves a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we develop a base model capable of integrating the source character with the target scene using pose guidance. The second stage further bootstraps controllable generation through a self-boosting mechanism, where we use the generated video in the first stage and replace the fine mask with the coarse one, enabling training outcomes with better preservation of character details. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Our project page is https://anycharv.github.io.</description>

      <title>ActiveSSF: An Active-Learning-Guided Self-Supervised Framework for Long-Tailed Megakaryocyte Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise classification of megakaryocytes is crucial for diagnosing myelodysplastic syndromes. Although self-supervised learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, its application to classifying megakaryocytes in stained slides faces three main challenges: (1) pervasive background noise that obscures cellular details, (2) a long-tailed distribution that limits data for rare subtypes, and (3) complex morphological variations leading to high intra-class variability. To address these issues, we propose the ActiveSSF framework, which integrates active learning with self-supervised pretraining. Specifically, our approach employs Gaussian filtering combined with K-means clustering and HSV analysis (augmented by clinical prior knowledge) for accurate region-of-interest extraction; an adaptive sample selection mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity thresholds to mitigate class imbalance; and prototype clustering on labeled samples to overcome morphological complexity. Experimental results on clinical megakaryocyte datasets demonstrate that ActiveSSF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly improves recognition accuracy for rare subtypes. Moreover, the integration of these advanced techniques further underscores the practical potential of ActiveSSF in clinical settings. To foster further research, the code and datasets will be publicly released in the future.</description>

      <title>Deepfake Detection with Spatio-Temporal Consistency and Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deepfake videos are causing growing concerns among communities due to their ever-increasing realism. Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</description>

      <title>Take What You Need: Flexible Multi-Task Semantic Communications with Channel Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient semantic communication systems capable of managing diverse tasks and adapting to fluctuating channel conditions has driven the development of robust, resource-efficient frameworks. This article introduces a novel channel-adaptive and multi-task-aware semantic communication framework based on a masked auto-encoder architecture. Our framework optimizes the transmission of meaningful information by incorporating a multi-task-aware scoring mechanism that identifies and prioritizes semantically significant data across multiple concurrent tasks. A channel-aware extractor is employed to dynamically select relevant information in response to real-time channel conditions. By jointly optimizing semantic relevance and transmission efficiency, the framework ensures minimal performance degradation under resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to conventional methods in tasks such as image reconstruction and object detection. These results underscore the framework's adaptability to heterogeneous channel environments and its scalability for multi-task applications, positioning it as a promising solution for next-generation semantic communication networks.</description>

      <title>TRISHUL: Towards Region Identification and Screen Hierarchy Understanding for Large VLM based GUI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</description>

      <title>Plantation Monitoring Using Drone Images: A Dataset and Performance Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic monitoring of tree plantations plays a crucial role in agriculture. Flawless monitoring of tree health helps farmers make informed decisions regarding their management by taking appropriate action. Use of drone images for automatic plantation monitoring can enhance the accuracy of the monitoring process, while still being affordable to small farmers in developing countries such as India. Small, low cost drones equipped with an RGB camera can capture high-resolution images of agricultural fields, allowing for detailed analysis of the well-being of the plantations. Existing methods of automated plantation monitoring are mostly based on satellite images, which are difficult to get for the farmers. We propose an automated system for plantation health monitoring using drone images, which are becoming easier to get for the farmers. We propose a dataset of images of trees with three categories: ``Good health", ``Stunted", and ``Dead". We annotate the dataset using CVAT annotation tool, for use in research purposes. We experiment with different well-known CNN models to observe their performance on the proposed dataset. The initial low accuracy levels show the complexity of the proposed dataset. Further, our study revealed that, depth-wise convolution operation embedded in a deep CNN model, can enhance the performance of the model on drone dataset. Further, we apply state-of-the-art object detection models to identify individual trees to better monitor them automatically.</description>

      <title>Learning Human Skill Generators at Key-Step Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are committed to learning human skill generators at key-step levels. The generation of skills is a challenging endeavor, but its successful implementation could greatly facilitate human skill learning and provide more experience for embodied intelligence. Although current video generation models can synthesis simple and atomic human operations, they struggle with human skills due to their complex procedure process. Human skills involve multi-step, long-duration actions and complex scene transitions, so the existing naive auto-regressive methods for synthesizing long videos cannot generate human skills. To address this, we propose a novel task, the Key-step Skill Generation (KS-Gen), aimed at reducing the complexity of generating human skill videos. Given the initial state and a skill description, the task is to generate video clips of key steps to complete the skill, rather than a full-length video. To support this task, we introduce a carefully curated dataset and define multiple evaluation metrics to assess performance. Considering the complexity of KS-Gen, we propose a new framework for this task. First, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) generates descriptions for key steps using retrieval argument. Subsequently, we use a Key-step Image Generator (KIG) to address the discontinuity between key steps in skill videos. Finally, a video generation model uses these descriptions and key-step images to generate video clips of the key steps with high temporal consistency. We offer a detailed analysis of the results, hoping to provide more insights on human skill generation. All models and data are available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/KS-Gen.</description>

      <title>FloVD: Optical Flow Meets Video Diffusion Model for Enhanced Camera-Controlled Video Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents FloVD, a novel optical-flow-based video diffusion model for camera-controllable video generation. FloVD leverages optical flow maps to represent motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches in terms of accurate camera control and natural object motion synthesis.</description>

      <title>UniCoRN: Unified Commented Retrieval Network with LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval methods have limitations in handling complex, compositional queries that require reasoning about the visual content of both the query and the retrieved entities. On the other hand, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can answer with language to more complex visual questions, but without the inherent ability to retrieve relevant entities to support their answers. We aim to address these limitations with UniCoRN, a Unified Commented Retrieval Network that combines the strengths of composed multimodal retrieval methods and generative language approaches, going beyond Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We introduce an entity adapter module to inject the retrieved multimodal entities back into the LMM, so it can attend to them while generating answers and comments. By keeping the base LMM frozen, UniCoRN preserves its original capabilities while being able to perform both retrieval and text generation tasks under a single integrated framework. To assess these new abilities, we introduce the Commented Retrieval task (CoR) and a corresponding dataset, with the goal of retrieving an image that accurately answers a given question and generate an additional textual response that provides further clarification and details about the visual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UniCoRN on several datasets showing improvements of +4.5% recall over the state of the art for composed multimodal retrieval and of +14.9% METEOR / +18.4% BEM over RAG for commenting in CoR.</description>

      <title>Fully-Geometric Cross-Attention for Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud registration approaches often fail when the overlap between point clouds is low due to noisy point correspondences. This work introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism tailored for Transformer-based architectures that tackles this problem, by fusing information from coordinates and features at the super-point level between point clouds. This formulation has remained unexplored primarily because it must guarantee rotation and translation invariance since point clouds reside in different and independent reference frames. We integrate the Gromov-Wasserstein distance into the cross-attention formulation to jointly compute distances between points across different point clouds and account for their geometric structure. By doing so, points from two distinct point clouds can attend to each other under arbitrary rigid transformations. At the point level, we also devise a self-attention mechanism that aggregates the local geometric structure information into point features for fine matching. Our formulation boosts the number of inlier correspondences, thereby yielding more precise registration results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We have conducted an extensive evaluation on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, KITTI, and 3DCSR datasets.</description>

      <title>When do they StOP?: A First Step Towards Automatically Identifying Team Communication in the Operating Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical performance depends not only on surgeons' technical skills but also on team communication within and across the different professional groups present during the operation. Therefore, automatically identifying team communication in the OR is crucial for patient safety and advances in the development of computer-assisted surgical workflow analysis and intra-operative support systems. To take the first step, we propose a new task of detecting communication briefings involving all OR team members, i.e. the team Time-out and the StOP?-protocol, by localizing their start and end times in video recordings of surgical operations. Methods: We generate an OR dataset of real surgeries, called Team-OR, with more than one hundred hours of surgical videos captured by the multi-view camera system in the OR. The dataset contains temporal annotations of 33 Time-out and 22 StOP?-protocol activities in total. We then propose a novel group activity detection approach, where we encode both scene context and action features, and use an efficient neural network model to output the results. Results: The experimental results on the Team-OR dataset show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art temporal action detection approaches. It also demonstrates the lack of research on group activities in the OR, proving the significance of our dataset. Conclusion: We investigate the Team Time-Out and the StOP?-protocol in the OR, by presenting the first OR dataset with temporal annotations of group activities protocols, and introducing a novel group activity detection approach that outperforms existing approaches.

      <title>Screener: Self-supervised Pathology Segmentation Model for 3D Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of all pathological findings in 3D medical images remains a significant challenge, as supervised models are limited to detecting only the few pathology classes annotated in existing datasets. To address this, we frame pathology segmentation as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning (SSL) for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pre-training, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Computational Pathology: A Review of Challenges, Opportunities, and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From self-supervised, vision-only models to contrastive visual-language frameworks, computational pathology has rapidly evolved in recent years. Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</description>

      <title>Hi-End-MAE: Hierarchical encoder-driven masked autoencoders are stronger vision learners for medical image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation remains a formidable challenge due to the label scarcity. Pre-training Vision Transformer (ViT) through masked image modeling (MIM) on large-scale unlabeled medical datasets presents a promising solution, providing both computational efficiency and model generalization for various downstream tasks. However, current ViT-based MIM pre-training frameworks predominantly emphasize local aggregation representations in output layers and fail to exploit the rich representations across different ViT layers that better capture fine-grained semantic information needed for more precise medical downstream tasks. To fill the above gap, we hereby present Hierarchical Encoder-driven MAE (Hi-End-MAE), a simple yet effective ViT-based pre-training solution, which centers on two key innovations: (1) Encoder-driven reconstruction, which encourages the encoder to learn more informative features to guide the reconstruction of masked patches; and (2) Hierarchical dense decoding, which implements a hierarchical decoding structure to capture rich representations across different layers. We pre-train Hi-End-MAE on a large-scale dataset of 10K CT scans and evaluated its performance across seven public medical image segmentation benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-End-MAE achieves superior transfer learning capabilities across various downstream tasks, revealing the potential of ViT in medical imaging applications.

      <title>Sat-DN: Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Multi-View Satellite Images with Depth and Normal Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in satellite imaging technology, acquiring high-resolution multi-view satellite imagery has become increasingly accessible, enabling rapid and location-independent ground model reconstruction. However, traditional stereo matching methods struggle to capture fine details, and while neural radiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality reconstructions, their training time is prohibitively long. Moreover, challenges such as low visibility of building facades, illumination and style differences between pixels, and weakly textured regions in satellite imagery further make it hard to reconstruct reasonable terrain geometry and detailed building facades. To address these issues, we propose Sat-DN, a novel framework leveraging a progressively trained multi-resolution hash grid reconstruction architecture with explicit depth guidance and surface normal consistency constraints to enhance reconstruction quality. The multi-resolution hash grid accelerates training, while the progressive strategy incrementally increases the learning frequency, using coarse low-frequency geometry to guide the reconstruction of fine high-frequency details. The depth and normal constraints ensure a clear building outline and correct planar distribution. Extensive experiments on the DFC2019 dataset demonstrate that Sat-DN outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

      <title>Uncertainty Aware Human-machine Collaboration in Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), the task of identifying objects concealed within their environments, has seen rapid growth due to its wide range of practical applications. A key step toward developing trustworthy COD systems is the estimation and effective utilization of uncertainty. In this work, we propose a human-machine collaboration framework for classifying the presence of camouflaged objects, leveraging the complementary strengths of computer vision (CV) models and noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Our approach introduces a multiview backbone to estimate uncertainty in CV model predictions, utilizes this uncertainty during training to improve efficiency, and defers low-confidence cases to human evaluation via RSVP-based BCIs during testing for more reliable decision-making. We evaluated the framework in the CAMO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 4.56\% in balanced accuracy (BA) and 3.66\% in the F1 score compared to existing methods. For the best-performing participants, the improvements reached 7.6\% in BA and 6.66\% in the F1 score. Analysis of the training process revealed a strong correlation between our confidence measures and precision, while an ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed training policy and the human-machine collaboration strategy. In general, this work reduces human cognitive load, improves system reliability, and provides a strong foundation for advancements in real-world COD applications and human-computer interaction.

      <title>AdvSwap: Covert Adversarial Perturbation with High Frequency Info-swapping for Autonomous Driving Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perception module of Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly susceptible to be attacked, which exploit vulnerabilities in neural networks through adversarial inputs, thereby compromising the AI safety. Some researches focus on creating covert adversarial samples, but existing global noise techniques are detectable and difficult to deceive the human visual system. This paper introduces a novel adversarial attack method, AdvSwap, which creatively utilizes wavelet-based high-frequency information swapping to generate covert adversarial samples and fool the camera. AdvSwap employs invertible neural network for selective high-frequency information swapping, preserving both forward propagation and data integrity. The scheme effectively removes the original label data and incorporates the guidance image data, producing concealed and robust adversarial samples. Experimental evaluations and comparisons on the GTSRB and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that AdvSwap can make concealed attacks on common traffic targets. The generates adversarial samples are also difficult to perceive by humans and algorithms. Meanwhile, the method has strong attacking robustness and attacking transferability.</description>

      <title>Not All Frame Features Are Equal: Video-to-4D Generation via Decoupling Dynamic-Static Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it regards the portions of current frame features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features. Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it adaptively selects a similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D. In addition, the experiments on a real-world scenario dataset demonstrate its effectiveness on the 4D scene. Our code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>ViLa-MIL: Dual-scale Vision-Language Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</description>

      <title>Handwritten Text Recognition: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has become an essential field within pattern recognition and machine learning, with applications spanning historical document preservation to modern data entry and accessibility solutions. The complexity of HTR lies in the high variability of handwriting, which makes it challenging to develop robust recognition systems. This survey examines the evolution of HTR models, tracing their progression from early heuristic-based approaches to contemporary state-of-the-art neural models, which leverage deep learning techniques. The scope of the field has also expanded, with models initially capable of recognizing only word-level content progressing to recent end-to-end document-level approaches. Our paper categorizes existing work into two primary levels of recognition: (1) \emph{up to line-level}, encompassing word and line recognition, and (2) \emph{beyond line-level}, addressing paragraph- and document-level challenges. We provide a unified framework that examines research methodologies, recent advances in benchmarking, key datasets in the field, and a discussion of the results reported in the literature. Finally, we identify pressing research challenges and outline promising future directions, aiming to equip researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for advancing the field.</description>

      <title>Composite Sketch+Text Queries for Retrieving Objects with Elusive Names and Complex Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-native speakers with limited vocabulary often struggle to name specific objects despite being able to visualize them, e.g., people outside Australia searching for numbats. Further, users may want to search for such elusive objects with difficult-to-sketch interactions, e.g., numbat digging in the ground. In such common but complex situations, users desire a search interface that accepts composite multimodal queries comprising hand-drawn sketches of difficult-to-name but easy-to-draw objects and text describing difficult-to-sketch but easy-to-verbalize object attributes or interaction with the scene. This novel problem statement distinctly differs from the previously well-researched TBIR (text-based image retrieval) and SBIR (sketch-based image retrieval) problems. To study this under-explored task, we curate a dataset, CSTBIR (Composite Sketch+Text Based Image Retrieval), consisting of approx. 2M queries and 108K natural scene images. Further, as a solution to this problem, we propose a pretrained multimodal transformer-based baseline, STNET (Sketch+Text Network), that uses a hand-drawn sketch to localize relevant objects in the natural scene image, and encodes the text and image to perform image retrieval. In addition to contrastive learning, we propose multiple training objectives that improve the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art retrieval methods for text-only, sketch-only, and composite query modalities. We make the dataset and code available at our project website.</description>

      <title>mmE5: Improving Multimodal Multilingual Embeddings via High-quality Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have gained significant attention for their ability to map data from different modalities, such as text and images, into a unified representation space. However, the limited labeled multimodal data often hinders embedding performance. Recent approaches have leveraged data synthesis to address this problem, yet the quality of synthetic data remains a critical bottleneck. In this work, we identify three criteria for high-quality synthetic multimodal data. First, broad scope ensures that the generated data covers diverse tasks and modalities, making it applicable to various downstream scenarios. Second, robust cross-modal alignment makes different modalities semantically consistent. Third, high fidelity ensures that the synthetic data maintains realistic details to enhance its reliability. Guided by these principles, we synthesize datasets that: (1) cover a wide range of tasks, modality combinations, and languages, (2) are generated via a deep thinking process within a single pass of a multimodal large language model, and (3) incorporate real-world images with accurate and relevant texts, ensuring fidelity through self-evaluation and refinement. Leveraging these high-quality synthetic and labeled datasets, we train a multimodal multilingual E5 model mmE5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mmE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB Benchmark and superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark. Our codes, datasets and models are released in https://github.com/haon-chen/mmE5.</description>

      <title>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation via Bidirectional Alignment Guided Joint Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) is critical for ecological monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management, requiring precise segmentation of objects in remote sensing imagery guided by textual descriptions. This task is uniquely challenging due to the considerable vision-language gap, the high spatial resolution and broad coverage of remote sensing imagery with diverse categories and small targets, and the presence of clustered, unclear targets with blurred edges. To tackle these issues, we propose \ours, a novel framework designed to bridge the vision-language gap, enhance multi-scale feature interaction, and improve fine-grained object differentiation. Specifically, \ours introduces: (1) the Bidirectional Spatial Correlation (BSC) for improved vision-language feature alignment, (2) the Target-Background TwinStream Decoder (T-BTD) for precise distinction between targets and non-targets, and (3) the Dual-Modal Object Learning Strategy (D-MOLS) for robust multimodal feature reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets RefSegRS and RRSIS-D demonstrate that \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, \ours improves the overall IoU (oIoU) by 3.76 percentage points (80.57) and 1.44 percentage points (79.23) on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, it outperforms previous methods in the mean IoU (mIoU) by 5.37 percentage points (67.95) and 1.84 percentage points (66.04), effectively addressing the core challenges of RRSIS with enhanced precision and robustness.</description>

      <title>Moment of Untruth: Dealing with Negative Queries in Video Moment Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a common task to evaluate the performance of visual-language models - it involves localising start and end times of moments in videos from query sentences. The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided.
  In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy. We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA. We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR. UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg. $98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.

      <title>Copula-based mixture model identification for subgroup clustering with imaging applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based clustering techniques have been widely applied to various application areas, while most studies focus on canonical mixtures with unique component distribution form. However, this strict assumption is often hard to satisfy. In this paper, we consider the more flexible Copula-Based Mixture Models (CBMMs) for clustering, which allow heterogeneous component distributions composed by flexible choices of marginal and copula forms. More specifically, we propose an adaptation of the Generalized Iterative Conditional Estimation (GICE) algorithm to identify the CBMMs in an unsupervised manner, where the marginal and copula forms and their parameters are estimated iteratively. GICE is adapted from its original version developed for switching Markov model identification with the choice of realization time. Our CBMM-GICE clustering method is then tested on synthetic two-cluster data (N=2000 samples) with discussion of the factors impacting its convergence. Finally, it is compared to the Expectation Maximization identified mixture models with unique component form on the entire MNIST database (N=70000), and on real cardiac magnetic resonance data (N=276) to illustrate its value for imaging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human understanding and generation are critical for modeling digital humans and humanoid embodiments. Recently, Human-centric Foundation Models (HcFMs) inspired by the success of generalist models, such as large language and vision models, have emerged to unify diverse human-centric tasks into a single framework, surpassing traditional task-specific approaches. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of HcFMs by proposing a taxonomy that categorizes current approaches into four groups: (1) Human-centric Perception Foundation Models that capture fine-grained features for multi-modal 2D and 3D understanding. (2) Human-centric AIGC Foundation Models that generate high-fidelity, diverse human-related content. (3) Unified Perception and Generation Models that integrate these capabilities to enhance both human understanding and synthesis. (4) Human-centric Agentic Foundation Models that extend beyond perception and generation to learn human-like intelligence and interactive behaviors for humanoid embodied tasks.

      <title>Brain Latent Progression: Individual-based Spatiotemporal Disease Progression on 3D Brain MRIs via Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing availability of longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets has facilitated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modeling of disease progression, making it possible to predict future medical scans for individual patients. However, despite significant advancements in AI, current methods continue to face challenges including achieving patient-specific individualization, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency, efficiently utilizing longitudinal data, and managing the substantial memory demands of 3D scans. To address these challenges, we propose Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), a novel spatiotemporal model designed to predict individual-level disease progression in 3D brain MRIs. The key contributions in BrLP are fourfold: (i) it operates in a small latent space, mitigating the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional imaging data; (ii) it explicitly integrates subject metadata to enhance the individualization of predictions; (iii) it incorporates prior knowledge of disease dynamics through an auxiliary model, facilitating the integration of longitudinal data; and (iv) it introduces the Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) algorithm, which (a) enforces spatiotemporal consistency in the predicted progression at inference time and (b) allows us to derive a measure of the uncertainty for the prediction. We train and evaluate BrLP on 11,730 T1-weighted (T1w) brain MRIs from 2,805 subjects and validate its generalizability on an external test set comprising 2,257 MRIs from 962 subjects. Our experiments compare BrLP-generated MRI scans with real follow-up MRIs, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy compared to existing methods.

      <title>A Novel Approach to for Multimodal Emotion Recognition : Multimodal semantic information fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies, multimodal emotion recognition has become a prominent research topic. However, existing methods face challenges such as heterogeneous data fusion and the effective utilization of modality correlations. This paper proposes a novel multimodal emotion recognition approach, DeepMSI-MER, based on the integration of contrastive learning and visual sequence compression. The proposed method enhances cross-modal feature fusion through contrastive learning and reduces redundancy in the visual modality by leveraging visual sequence compression. Experimental results on two public datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate that DeepMSI-MER significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of emotion recognition, validating the effectiveness of multimodal feature fusion and the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Image Generation using Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation have been a subject of increasing interest due to their ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. Image generation has immense potential in medical imaging because open-source medical images are difficult to obtain compared to natural images, especially for rare conditions. The generated images can be used later to train classification and segmentation models. In this paper, we propose simulating realistic ultrasound (US) images by successive fine-tuning of large diffusion models on different publicly available databases. To do so, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model, on BUSI (Breast US Images) an ultrasound breast image dataset. We successfully generated high-quality US images of the breast using simple prompts that specify the organ and pathology, which appeared realistic to three experienced US scientists and a US radiologist. Additionally, we provided user control by conditioning the model with segmentations through ControlNet. We will release the source code at http://code.sonography.ai/ to allow fast US image generation to the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Light-A-Video: Training-free Video Relighting via Progressive Light Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

      <title>PulseCheck457: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Comprehensive Spatial Reasoning of Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present PulseCheck457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.</description>

      <title>CineMaster: A 3D-Aware and Controllable Framework for Cinematic Text-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present CineMaster, a novel framework for 3D-aware and controllable text-to-video generation. Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

      <title>SwiftSketch: A Diffusion Model for Image-to-Vector Sketch Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large vision-language models have enabled highly expressive and diverse vector sketch generation. However, state-of-the-art methods rely on a time-consuming optimization process involving repeated feedback from a pretrained model to determine stroke placement. Consequently, despite producing impressive sketches, these methods are limited in practical applications. In this work, we introduce SwiftSketch, a diffusion model for image-conditioned vector sketch generation that can produce high-quality sketches in less than a second. SwiftSketch operates by progressively denoising stroke control points sampled from a Gaussian distribution. Its transformer-decoder architecture is designed to effectively handle the discrete nature of vector representation and capture the inherent global dependencies between strokes. To train SwiftSketch, we construct a synthetic dataset of image-sketch pairs, addressing the limitations of existing sketch datasets, which are often created by non-artists and lack professional quality. For generating these synthetic sketches, we introduce ControlSketch, a method that enhances SDS-based techniques by incorporating precise spatial control through a depth-aware ControlNet. We demonstrate that SwiftSketch generalizes across diverse concepts, efficiently producing sketches that combine high fidelity with a natural and visually appealing style.</description>

      <title>Poly-Autoregressive Prediction for Modeling Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple framework for predicting the behavior of an agent in multi-agent settings. In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios. The project website can be found at https://neerja.me/PAR/.</description>

      <title>CTR-Driven Advertising Image Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In web data, advertising images are crucial for capturing user attention and improving advertising effectiveness. Most existing methods generate background for products primarily focus on the aesthetic quality, which may fail to achieve satisfactory online performance. To address this limitation, we explore the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for generating advertising images by optimizing for Click-Through Rate (CTR) as the primary objective. Firstly, we build targeted pre-training tasks, and leverage a large-scale e-commerce multimodal dataset to equip MLLMs with initial capabilities for advertising image generation tasks. To further improve the CTR of generated images, we propose a novel reward model to fine-tune pre-trained MLLMs through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can jointly utilize multimodal features and accurately reflect user click preferences. Meanwhile, a product-centric preference optimization strategy is developed to ensure that the generated background content aligns with the product characteristics after fine-tuning, enhancing the overall relevance and effectiveness of the advertising images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both online and offline metrics. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/Chenguoz/CAIG.</description>

      <title>CP-Guard+: A New Paradigm for Malicious Agent Detection and Defense in Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) is a promising method for safe connected and autonomous driving, which enables multiple vehicles to share sensing information to enhance perception performance. However, compared with single-vehicle perception, the openness of a CP system makes it more vulnerable to malicious attacks that can inject malicious information to mislead the perception of an ego vehicle, resulting in severe risks for safe driving. To mitigate such vulnerability, we first propose a new paradigm for malicious agent detection that effectively identifies malicious agents at the feature level without requiring verification of final perception results, significantly reducing computational overhead. Building on this paradigm, we introduce CP-GuardBench, the first comprehensive dataset provided to train and evaluate various malicious agent detection methods for CP systems. Furthermore, we develop a robust defense method called CP-Guard+, which enhances the margin between the representations of benign and malicious features through a carefully designed Dual-Centered Contrastive Loss (DCCLoss). Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both CP-GuardBench and V2X-Sim, and demonstrate the superiority of CP-Guard+.</description>

      <title>The establishment of static digital humans and the integration with spinal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a prevalent spinal deformity, significantly affects individuals' health and quality of life. Conventional imaging techniques, such as X - rays, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), offer static views of the spine. However, they are restricted in capturing the dynamic changes of the spine and its interactions with overall body motion. Therefore, developing new techniques to address these limitations has become extremely important. Dynamic digital human modeling represents a major breakthrough in digital medicine. It enables a three - dimensional (3D) view of the spine as it changes during daily activities, assisting clinicians in detecting deformities that might be missed in static imaging. Although dynamic modeling holds great potential, constructing an accurate static digital human model is a crucial initial step for high - precision simulations. In this study, our focus is on constructing an accurate static digital human model integrating the spine, which is vital for subsequent dynamic digital human research on AIS. First, we generate human point - cloud data by combining the 3D Gaussian method with the Skinned Multi - Person Linear (SMPL) model from the patient's multi - view images. Then, we fit a standard skeletal model to the generated human model. Next, we align the real spine model reconstructed from CT images with the standard skeletal model. We validated the resulting personalized spine model using X - ray data from six AIS patients, with Cobb angles (used to measure the severity of scoliosis) as evaluation metrics. The results indicate that the model's error was within 1 degree of the actual measurements. This study presents an important method for constructing digital humans.</description>

      <title>Advancing Heat Demand Forecasting with Attention Mechanisms: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global leaders and policymakers are unified in their unequivocal commitment to decarbonization efforts in support of Net-Zero agreements. District Heating Systems (DHS), while contributing to carbon emissions due to the continued reliance on fossil fuels for heat production, are embracing more sustainable practices albeit with some sense of vulnerability as it could constrain their ability to adapt to dynamic demand and production scenarios. As demographic demands grow and renewables become the central strategy in decarbonizing the heating sector, the need for accurate demand forecasting has intensified. Advances in digitization have paved the way for Machine Learning (ML) based solutions to become the industry standard for modeling complex time series patterns. In this paper, we focus on building a Deep Learning (DL) model that uses deconstructed components of independent and dependent variables that affect heat demand as features to perform multi-step ahead forecasting of head demand. The model represents the input features in a time-frequency space and uses an attention mechanism to generate accurate forecasts. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset and the forecasting performance is assessed against LSTM and CNN-based forecasting models. Across different supply zones, the attention-based models outperforms the baselines quantitatively and qualitatively, with an Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.105 with a standard deviation of 0.06kW h and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.4% with a standard deviation of 2.8%, in comparison the second best model with a MAE of 0.10 with a standard deviation of 0.06kW h and a MAPE of 5.6% with a standard deviation of 3%.</description>

      <title>Automatic Prostate Volume Estimation in Transabdominal Ultrasound Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prostate cancer is a leading health concern among men, requiring accurate and accessible methods for early detection and risk stratification. Prostate volume (PV) is a key parameter in multivariate risk stratification for early prostate cancer detection, commonly estimated using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). While TRUS provides precise prostate volume measurements, its invasive nature often compromises patient comfort. Transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) provides a non-invasive alternative but faces challenges such as lower image quality, complex interpretation, and reliance on operator expertise. This study introduces a new deep-learning-based framework for automatic PV estimation using TAUS, emphasizing its potential to enable accurate and non-invasive prostate cancer risk stratification. A dataset of TAUS videos from 100 individual patients was curated, with manually delineated prostate boundaries and calculated diameters by an expert clinician as ground truth. The introduced framework integrates deep-learning models for prostate segmentation in both axial and sagittal planes, automatic prostate diameter estimation, and PV calculation. Segmentation performance was evaluated using Dice correlation coefficient (%) and Hausdorff distance (mm). Framework's volume estimation capabilities were evaluated on volumetric error (mL). The framework demonstrates that it can estimate PV from TAUS videos with a mean volumetric error of -5.5 mL, which results in an average relative error between 5 and 15%. The introduced framework for automatic PV estimation from TAUS images, utilizing deep learning models for prostate segmentation, shows promising results. It effectively segments the prostate and estimates its volume, offering potential for reliable, non-invasive risk stratification for early prostate detection.</description>

Nevertheless, they struggle with varying compute resource availability (due to multi-tenancy, device heterogeneity, etc.) and fluctuating quality of inputs (from sensor feed corruption, environmental noise, etc.). Current multimodal systems employ static resource provisioning and cannot easily adapt when compute resources change over time. Additionally, their reliance on processing sensor data with fixed feature extractors is ill-equipped to handle variations in modality quality. Consequently, uninformative modalities, such as those with high noise, needlessly consume resources better allocated towards other modalities. We propose ADMN, a layer-wise Adaptive Depth Multimodal Network capable of tackling both challenges - it adjusts the total number of active layers across all modalities to meet compute resource constraints, and continually reallocates layers across input modalities according to their modality quality. Our evaluations showcase ADMN can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art networks while reducing up to 75% of their floating-point operations.</description>

      <title>Towards Training One-Step Diffusion Models Without Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in one-step generative models typically follow a two-stage process: first training a teacher diffusion model and then distilling it into a one-step student model. This distillation process traditionally relies on both the teacher model's score function to compute the distillation loss and its weights for student initialization. In this paper, we explore whether one-step generative models can be trained directly without this distillation process. First, we show that the teacher's score function is not essential and propose a family of distillation methods that achieve competitive results without relying on score estimation. Next, we demonstrate that initialization from teacher weights is indispensable in successful training. Surprisingly, we find that this benefit is not due to improved ``input-output" mapping but rather the learned feature representations, which dominate distillation quality. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role of initialization in one-step model training and its impact on distillation quality.</description>

      <title>PoGDiff: Product-of-Gaussians Diffusion Models for Imbalanced Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have made significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance often deteriorates when trained or fine-tuned on imbalanced datasets. This degradation is largely due to the disproportionate representation of majority and minority data in image-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a general fine-tuning approach, dubbed PoGDiff, to address this challenge. Rather than directly minimizing the KL divergence between the predicted and ground-truth distributions, PoGDiff replaces the ground-truth distribution with a Product of Gaussians (PoG), which is constructed by combining the original ground-truth targets with the predicted distribution conditioned on a neighboring text embedding. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the imbalance problem in diffusion models, improving both generation accuracy and quality.</description>

      <title>Force Matching with Relativistic Constraints: A Physics-Inspired Approach to Stable and Efficient Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Force Matching (ForM), a novel framework for generative modeling that represents an initial exploration into leveraging special relativistic mechanics to enhance the stability of the sampling process. By incorporating the Lorentz factor, ForM imposes a velocity constraint, ensuring that sample velocities remain bounded within a constant limit. This constraint serves as a fundamental mechanism for stabilizing the generative dynamics, leading to a more robust and controlled sampling process. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that the velocity constraint is preserved throughout the sampling procedure within the ForM framework. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations. On the \textit{half-moons} dataset, ForM significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving the lowest Euclidean distance loss of \textbf{0.714}, in contrast to vanilla first-order flow matching (5.853) and first- and second-order flow matching (5.793). Additionally, we perform an ablation study to further investigate the impact of our velocity constraint, reaffirming the superiority of ForM in stabilizing the generative process. The theoretical guarantees and empirical results underscore the potential of integrating special relativity principles into generative modeling. Our findings suggest that ForM provides a promising pathway toward achieving stable, efficient, and flexible generative processes. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in high-dimensional generative modeling, opening new avenues for the application of physical principles in machine learning.</description>

      <title>DNNs May Determine Major Properties of Their Outputs Early, with Timing Possibly Driven by Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that deep neural networks (DNNs) mostly determine their outputs during the early stages of inference, where biases inherent in the model play a crucial role in shaping this process. We draw a parallel between this phenomenon and human decision-making, which often relies on fast, intuitive heuristics. Using diffusion models (DMs) as a case study, we demonstrate that DNNs often make early-stage decision-making influenced by the type and extent of bias in their design and training. Our findings offer a new perspective on bias mitigation, efficient inference, and the interpretation of machine learning systems. By identifying the temporal dynamics of decision-making in DNNs, this paper aims to inspire further discussion and research within the machine learning community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity significantly complicates the continual learning problem, i.e., how a deep neural network learns in dynamic environments with very few samples. However, the latest progress of few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) methods and related studies show insightful knowledge on how to tackle the problem. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on FSCIL that highlights several important aspects i.e. comprehensive and formal objectives of FSCIL approaches, the importance of prototype rectifications, the new learning paradigms based on pre-trained model and language-guided mechanism, the deeper analysis of FSCIL performance metrics and evaluation, and the practical contexts of FSCIL in various areas. Our extensive discussion presents the open challenges, potential solutions, and future directions of FSCIL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transforming recorded videos into concise and accurate textual summaries is a growing challenge in multimodal learning. This paper introduces VISTA, a dataset specifically designed for video-to-text summarization in scientific domains. VISTA contains 18,599 recorded AI conference presentations paired with their corresponding paper abstracts. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art large models and apply a plan-based framework to better capture the structured nature of abstracts. Both human and automated evaluations confirm that explicit planning enhances summary quality and factual consistency. However, a considerable gap remains between models and human performance, highlighting the challenges of scientific video summarization.</description>

      <title>CRISP: A Framework for Cryo-EM Image Segmentation and Processing with Conditional Random Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiating signals from the background in micrographs is a critical initial step for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), yet it remains laborious due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the presence of contaminants and densely packed particles of varying sizes. Although image segmentation has recently been introduced to distinguish particles at the pixel level, the low SNR complicates the automated generation of accurate annotations for training supervised models. Moreover, platforms for systematically comparing different design choices in pipeline construction are lacking. Thus, a modular framework is essential to understand the advantages and limitations of this approach and drive further development. To address these challenges, we present a pipeline that automatically generates high-quality segmentation maps from cryo-EM data to serve as ground truth labels. Our modular framework enables the selection of various segmentation models and loss functions. We also integrate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with different solvers and feature sets to refine coarse predictions, thereby producing fine-grained segmentation. This flexibility facilitates optimal configurations tailored to cryo-EM datasets. When trained on a limited set of micrographs, our approach achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-score on synthetic data. Furthermore, to demonstrate our framework's efficacy in downstream analyses, we show that the particles extracted by our pipeline produce 3D density maps with higher resolution than those generated by existing particle pickers on real experimental datasets, while achieving performance comparable to that of manually curated datasets from experts.</description>

      <title>BEAM: Bridging Physically-based Rendering and Gaussian Modeling for Relightable Volumetric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volumetric video enables immersive experiences by capturing dynamic 3D scenes, enabling diverse applications for virtual reality, education, and telepresence. However, traditional methods struggle with fixed lighting conditions, while neural approaches face trade-offs in efficiency, quality, or adaptability for relightable scenarios. To address these limitations, we present BEAM, a novel pipeline that bridges 4D Gaussian representations with physically-based rendering (PBR) to produce high-quality, relightable volumetric videos from multi-view RGB footage. BEAM recovers detailed geometry and PBR properties via a series of available Gaussian-based techniques. It first combines Gaussian-based performance tracking with geometry-aware rasterization in a coarse-to-fine optimization framework to recover spatially and temporally consistent geometries. We further enhance Gaussian attributes by incorporating PBR properties step by step. We generate roughness via a multi-view-conditioned diffusion model, and then derive AO and base color using a 2D-to-3D strategy, incorporating a tailored Gaussian-based ray tracer for efficient visibility computation. Once recovered, these dynamic, relightable assets integrate seamlessly into traditional CG pipelines, supporting real-time rendering with deferred shading and offline rendering with ray tracing. By offering realistic, lifelike visualizations under diverse lighting conditions, BEAM opens new possibilities for interactive entertainment, storytelling, and creative visualization.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Spatial Relations through Constraint-Aware Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial relation hallucinations pose a persistent challenge in large vision-language models (LVLMs), leading to generate incorrect predictions about object positions and spatial configurations within an image. To address this issue, we propose a constraint-aware prompting framework designed to reduce spatial relation hallucinations. Specifically, we introduce two types of constraints: (1) bidirectional constraint, which ensures consistency in pairwise object relations, and (2) transitivity constraint, which enforces relational dependence across multiple objects. By incorporating these constraints, LVLMs can produce more spatially coherent and consistent outputs. We evaluate our method on three widely-used spatial relation datasets, demonstrating performance improvements over existing approaches. Additionally, a systematic analysis of various bidirectional relation analysis choices and transitivity reference selections highlights greater possibilities of our methods in incorporating constraints to mitigate spatial relation hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Restoration of Pruned Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although network pruning has been highly popularized to compress deep neural networks, its resulting accuracy heavily depends on a fine-tuning process that is often computationally expensive and requires the original data. However, this may not be the case in real-world scenarios, and hence a few recent works attempt to restore pruned networks without any expensive retraining process. Their strong assumption is that every neuron being pruned can be replaced with another one quite similar to it, but unfortunately this does not hold in many neural networks, where the similarity between neurons is extremely low in some layers. In this article, we propose a more rigorous and robust method of restoring pruned networks in a fine-tuning free and data-free manner, called LBYL (Leave Before You Leave). LBYL significantly relaxes the aforementioned assumption in a way that each pruned neuron leaves its pieces of information to as many preserved neurons as possible and thereby multiple neurons together obtain a more robust approximation to the original output of the neuron who just left. Our method is based on a theoretical analysis on how to formulate the reconstruction error between the original network and its approximation, which nicely leads to a closed form solution for our derived loss function. Through the extensive experiments, LBYL is confirmed to be indeed more effective to approximate the original network and consequently able to achieve higher accuracy for restored networks, compared to the recent approaches exploiting the similarity between two neurons. The very first version of this work, which contains major technical and theoretical components, was submitted to NeurIPS 2021 and ICML 2022.</description>

      <title>BCDDM: Branch-Corrected Denoising Diffusion Model for Black Hole Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) have demonstrated applications in architecture, design, and fabrication. Compared to conventional 2D construction drawings, AR can be used to superimpose contextual instructions, display 3D spatial information and enable on-site engagement. Despite the potential of AR, the widespread adoption of the technology in the industry is limited by its precision. Precision is important for projects requiring strict construction tolerances, design fidelity, and fabrication feedback. For example, the manufacturing of glulam beams requires tolerances of less than 2mm. The goal of this project is to explore the industrial application of using multiple fiducial markers for high-precision AR fabrication. While the method has been validated in lab settings with a precision of 0.97, this paper focuses on fabricating glulam beams in a factory setting with an industry manufacturer, Unalam Factory.</description>

      <title>Randomness of Low-Layer Parameters Determines Confusing Samples in Terms of Interaction Representations of a DNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that the complexity of interactions encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) can explain its generalization power. We also discover that the confusing samples of a DNN, which are represented by non-generalizable interactions, are determined by its low-layer parameters. In comparison, other factors, such as high-layer parameters and network architecture, have much less impact on the composition of confusing samples. Two DNNs with different low-layer parameters usually have fully different sets of confusing samples, even though they have similar performance. This finding extends the understanding of the lottery ticket hypothesis, and well explains distinctive representation power of different DNNs.</description>

      <title>Rapid Whole Brain Mesoscale In-vivo MR Imaging using Multi-scale Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate a novel image reconstruction technique using implicit neural representations (INR) for multi-view thick-slice acquisitions while reducing the scan time but maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Methods: We propose Rotating-view super-resolution (ROVER)-MRI, an unsupervised neural network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct MRI data from multi-view thick slices, effectively reducing scan time by 2-fold while maintaining fine anatomical details. We compare our method to both bicubic interpolation and the current state-of-the-art regularized least-squares super-resolution reconstruction (LS-SRR) technique. Validation is performed using ground-truth ex-vivo monkey brain data, and we demonstrate superior reconstruction quality across several in-vivo human datasets. Notably, we achieve the reconstruction of a whole human brain in-vivo T2-weighted image with an unprecedented 180{\mu}m isotropic spatial resolution, accomplished in just 17 minutes of scan time on a 7T MRI scanner. Results: ROVER-MRI outperformed LS-SRR method in terms of reconstruction quality with 22.4% lower relative error (RE) and 7.5% lower full-width half maximum (FWHM) indicating better preservation of fine structural details in nearly half the scan time. Conclusion: ROVER-MRI offers an efficient and robust approach for mesoscale MR imaging, enabling rapid, high-resolution whole-brain scans. Its versatility holds great promise for research applications requiring anatomical details and time-efficient imaging.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AIs rapidly advance and become more agentic, the risk they pose is governed not only by their capabilities but increasingly by their propensities, including goals and values. Tracking the emergence of goals and values has proven a longstanding problem, and despite much interest over the years it remains unclear whether current AIs have meaningful values. We propose a solution to this problem, leveraging the framework of utility functions to study the internal coherence of AI preferences. Surprisingly, we find that independently-sampled preferences in current LLMs exhibit high degrees of structural coherence, and moreover that this emerges with scale. These findings suggest that value systems emerge in LLMs in a meaningful sense, a finding with broad implications. To study these emergent value systems, we propose utility engineering as a research agenda, comprising both the analysis and control of AI utilities. We uncover problematic and often shocking values in LLM assistants despite existing control measures. These include cases where AIs value themselves over humans and are anti-aligned with specific individuals. To constrain these emergent value systems, we propose methods of utility control. As a case study, we show how aligning utilities with a citizen assembly reduces political biases and generalizes to new scenarios. Whether we like it or not, value systems have already emerged in AIs, and much work remains to fully understand and control these emergent representations.</description>

      <title>A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</description>

      <title>LocalViT: Analyzing Locality in Vision Transformers</title>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the influence of locality mechanisms in vision transformers. Transformers originated from machine translation and are particularly good at modelling long-range dependencies within a long sequence. Although the global interaction between the token embeddings could be well modelled by the self-attention mechanism of transformers, what is lacking is a locality mechanism for information exchange within a local region. In this paper, locality mechanism is systematically investigated by carefully designed controlled experiments. We add locality to vision transformers into the feed-forward network. This seemingly simple solution is inspired by the comparison between feed-forward networks and inverted residual blocks. The importance of locality mechanisms is validated in two ways: 1) A wide range of design choices (activation function, layer placement, expansion ratio) are available for incorporating locality mechanisms and proper choices can lead to a performance gain over the baseline, and 2) The same locality mechanism is successfully applied to vision transformers with different architecture designs, which shows the generalization of the locality concept. For ImageNet2012 classification, the locality-enhanced transformers outperform the baselines Swin-T, DeiT-T, and PVT-T by 1.0%, 2.6% and 3.1% with a negligible increase in the number of parameters and computational effort.

      <title>Vision Transformer for Classification of Breast Ultrasound Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical ultrasound (US) imaging has become a prominent modality for breast cancer imaging due to its ease-of-use, low-cost and safety. In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the method of choice in vision applications and have shown excellent potential in automatic classification of US images. Despite their success, their restricted local receptive field limits their ability to learn global context information. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) designs that are based on self-attention between image patches have shown great potential to be an alternative to CNNs. In this study, for the first time, we utilize ViT to classify breast US images using different augmentation strategies. The results are provided as classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, and the performance is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs. The results indicate that the ViT models have comparable efficiency with or even better than the CNNs in classification of US breast images.</description>

      <title>Normal Transformer: Extracting Surface Geometry from LiDAR Points Enhanced by Visual Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality surface normal can help improve geometry estimation in problems faced by autonomous vehicles, such as collision avoidance and occlusion inference. While a considerable volume of literature focuses on densely scanned indoor scenarios, normal estimation during autonomous driving remains an intricate problem due to the sparse, non-uniform, and noisy nature of real-world LiDAR scans. In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal technique that leverages 3D point clouds and 2D colour images obtained from LiDAR and camera sensors for surface normal estimation. We present the Hybrid Geometric Transformer (HGT), a novel transformer-based neural network architecture that proficiently fuses visual semantic and 3D geometric information. Furthermore, we developed an effective learning strategy for the multi-modal data. Experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our information fusion approach compared to existing methods. It has also been verified that the proposed model can learn from a simulated 3D environment that mimics a traffic scene. The learned geometric knowledge is transferable and can be applied to real-world 3D scenes in the KITTI dataset. Further tasks built upon the estimated normal vectors in the KITTI dataset show that the proposed estimator has an advantage over existing methods.</description>

      <title>FCN+: Global Receptive Convolution Makes FCN Great Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully convolutional network (FCN) is a seminal work for semantic segmentation. However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot effectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic segmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods that leverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a strategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to effectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information extraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides the global receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable parameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional filter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input feature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter into two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to different spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their channel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global context information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains unchanged to keep the original location information. By convolving using these two groups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location information of each pixel for better dense prediction results. With the GRC built in, FCN+ can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation tasks, as verified on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and ADE20K. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Zhongying-Deng/FCN_Plus.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Visual Recognition: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep learning excels in computer vision tasks with abundant labeled data, its performance diminishes significantly in scenarios with limited labeled samples. To address this, Few-shot learning (FSL) enables models to perform the target tasks with very few labeled examples by leveraging prior knowledge from related tasks. However, traditional FSL assumes that both the related and target tasks come from the same domain, which is a restrictive assumption in many real-world scenarios where domain differences are common. To overcome this limitation, Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) has gained attention, as it allows source and target data to come from different domains and label spaces. This paper presents the first comprehensive review of Cross-domain Few-shot Learning (CDFSL), a field that has received less attention compared to traditional FSL due to its unique challenges. We aim to provide both a position paper and a tutorial for researchers, covering key problems, existing methods, and future research directions. The review begins with a formal definition of CDFSL, outlining its core challenges, followed by a systematic analysis of current approaches, organized under a clear taxonomy. Finally, we discuss promising future directions in terms of problem setups, applications, and theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Learning without Forgetting for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) or continual learning is a desired capability in the real world, which requires a learning system to adapt to new tasks without forgetting former ones. While traditional CIL methods focus on visual information to grasp core features, recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLM) have shown promising capabilities in learning generalizable representations with the aid of textual information. However, when continually trained with new classes, VLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of former knowledge. Applying VLMs to CIL poses two major challenges: 1) how to adapt the model without forgetting; and 2) how to make full use of the multi-modal information. To this end, we propose PROjectiOn Fusion (PROOF) that enables VLMs to learn without forgetting. To handle the first challenge, we propose training task-specific projections based on the frozen image/text encoders. When facing new tasks, new projections are expanded and former projections are fixed, alleviating the forgetting of old concepts. For the second challenge, we propose the fusion module to better utilize the cross-modality information. By jointly adjusting visual and textual features, the model can capture semantic information with stronger representation ability. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets validate PROOF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/zhoudw-zdw/PROOF</description>

      <title>Absorption-Based, Passive Range Imaging from Hyperspectral Thermal Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive hyperspectral longwave infrared measurements are remarkably informative about the surroundings. Remote object material and temperature determine the spectrum of thermal radiance, and range, air temperature, and gas concentrations determine how this spectrum is modified by propagation to the sensor. We introduce a passive range imaging method based on computationally separating these phenomena. Previous methods assume hot and highly emitting objects; ranging is more challenging when objects' temperatures do not deviate greatly from air temperature. Our method jointly estimates range and intrinsic object properties, with explicit consideration of air emission, though reflected light is assumed negligible. Inversion being underdetermined is mitigated by using a parametric model of atmospheric absorption and regularizing for smooth emissivity estimates. To assess where our estimate is likely accurate, we introduce a technique to detect which scene pixels are significantly influenced by reflected downwelling. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the importance of regularization, temperature differentials, and availability of many spectral bands. We apply our method to longwave infrared (8--13 $\mu$m) hyperspectral image data acquired from natural scenes with no active illumination. Range features from 15m to 150m are recovered, with good qualitative match to lidar data for pixels classified as having negligible reflected downwelling.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown great potential in modeling 3D scenes. Dynamic NeRFs extend this model by capturing time-varying elements, typically using deformation fields. The existing dynamic NeRFs employ a similar Eulerian representation for both light radiance and deformation fields. This leads to a close coupling of appearance and motion and lacks a physical interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists of the superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is quantized as a collection of appearance particles, which carries the visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features and the motion models of particles, are learned from monocular videos without any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient computational framework for the particle-based model. We also construct a new dataset to evaluate motion modeling. Experimental results show that DAP-NeRF is an effective technique to capture not only the appearance but also the physically meaningful motions in a 3D dynamic scene.

Abstract: Precise image segmentation provides clinical study with instructive information. Despite the remarkable progress achieved in medical image segmentation, there is still an absence of a 3D foundation segmentation model that can segment a wide range of anatomical categories with easy user interaction. In this paper, we propose a 3D foundation segmentation model, named SegVol, supporting universal and interactive volumetric medical image segmentation. By scaling up training data to 90K unlabeled Computed Tomography (CT) volumes and 6K labeled CT volumes, this foundation model supports the segmentation of over 200 anatomical categories using semantic and spatial prompts. To facilitate efficient and precise inference on volumetric images, we design a zoom-out-zoom-in mechanism. Extensive experiments on 22 anatomical segmentation tasks verify that SegVol outperforms the competitors in 19 tasks, with improvements up to 37.24% compared to the runner-up methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and importance of specific designs by ablation study. We expect this foundation model can promote the development of volumetric medical image analysis.

      <title>SAM-DiffSR: Structure-Modulated Diffusion Model for Image Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) models have recently garnered significant attention due to their potent restoration capabilities. But conventional diffusion models perform noise sampling from a single distribution, constraining their ability to handle real-world scenes and complex textures across semantic regions. With the success of segment anything model (SAM), generating sufficiently fine-grained region masks can enhance the detail recovery of diffusion-based SR model. However, directly integrating SAM into SR models will result in much higher computational cost. In this paper, we propose the SAM-DiffSR model, which can utilize the fine-grained structure information from SAM in the process of sampling noise to improve the image quality without additional computational cost during inference. In the process of training, we encode structural position information into the segmentation mask from SAM. Then the encoded mask is integrated into the forward diffusion process by modulating it to the sampled noise. This adjustment allows us to independently adapt the noise mean within each corresponding segmentation area. The diffusion model is trained to estimate this modulated noise. Crucially, our proposed framework does NOT change the reverse diffusion process and does NOT require SAM at inference. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing superior performance in suppressing artifacts, and surpassing existing diffusion-based methods by 0.74 dB at the maximum in terms of PSNR on DIV2K dataset. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lose4578/SAM-DiffSR.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Unconstrained Head Pose Estimation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing research on unconstrained in-the-wild head pose estimation suffers from the flaws of its datasets, which consist of either numerous samples by non-realistic synthesis or constrained collection, or small-scale natural images yet with plausible manual annotations. This makes fully-supervised solutions compromised due to the reliance on generous labels. To alleviate it, we propose the first semi-supervised unconstrained head pose estimation method SemiUHPE, which can leverage abundant easily available unlabeled head images. Technically, we choose semi-supervised rotation regression and adapt it to the error-sensitive and label-scarce problem of unconstrained head pose. Our method is based on the observation that the aspect-ratio invariant cropping of wild heads is superior to previous landmark-based affine alignment given that landmarks of unconstrained human heads are usually unavailable, especially for underexplored non-frontal heads. Instead of using a pre-fixed threshold to filter out pseudo labeled heads, we propose dynamic entropy based filtering to adaptively remove unlabeled outliers as training progresses by updating the threshold in multiple stages. We then revisit the design of weak-strong augmentations and improve it by devising two novel head-oriented strong augmentations, termed pose-irrelevant cut-occlusion and pose-altering rotation consistency respectively. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that SemiUHPE outperforms its counterparts greatly on public benchmarks under both the front-range and full-range settings. Furthermore, our proposed method is also beneficial for solving other closely related problems, including generic object rotation regression and 3D head reconstruction, demonstrating good versatility and extensibility.

      <title>3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently become popular for neural rendering, current methods rely on carefully engineered cloning and splitting strategies for placing Gaussians, which can lead to poor-quality renderings, and reliance on a good initialization. In this work, we rethink the set of 3D Gaussians as a random sample drawn from an underlying probability distribution describing the physical representation of the scene-in other words, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Under this view, we show that the 3D Gaussian updates can be converted as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates by simply introducing noise. We then rewrite the densification and pruning strategies in 3D Gaussian Splatting as simply a deterministic state transition of MCMC samples, removing these heuristics from the framework. To do so, we revise the 'cloning' of Gaussians into a relocalization scheme that approximately preserves sample probability. To encourage efficient use of Gaussians, we introduce a regularizer that promotes the removal of unused Gaussians. On various standard evaluation scenes, we show that our method provides improved rendering quality, easy control over the number of Gaussians, and robustness to initialization.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Calibration by Gaining Aware of Prediction Correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model calibration aims to align confidence with prediction correctness. The Cross-Entropy (CE) loss is widely used for calibrator training, which enforces the model to increase confidence on the ground truth class. However, we find the CE loss has intrinsic limitations. For example, for a narrow misclassification (e.g., a test sample is wrongly classified and its softmax score on the ground truth class is 0.4), a calibrator trained by the CE loss often produces high confidence on the wrongly predicted class, which is undesirable. In this paper, we propose a new post-hoc calibration objective derived from the aim of calibration. Intuitively, the proposed objective function asks that the calibrator decrease model confidence on wrongly predicted samples and increase confidence on correctly predicted samples. Because a sample itself has insufficient ability to indicate correctness, we use its transformed versions (e.g., rotated, greyscaled, and color-jittered) during calibrator training. Trained on an in-distribution validation set and tested with isolated, individual test samples, our method achieves competitive calibration performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets compared with the state of the art. Further, our analysis points out the difference between our method and commonly used objectives such as CE loss and Mean Square Error (MSE) loss, where the latters sometimes deviates from the calibration aim.</description>

      <title>UEMM-Air: A Synthetic Multi-modal Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of multi-modal learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically relies on a large amount of pixel-aligned multi-modal image data. However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based multi-task dataset, UEMM-Air. Specifically, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Furthermore, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. Finally, we utilize labels to generate text descriptions of images to make our UEMM-Air support more cross-modality tasks. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 120k pairs of images with 6 modalities and precise annotations. Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset. We also found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets. The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal tasks on UAVs.</description>

      <title>Robot Instance Segmentation with Few Annotations for Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Posters play a crucial role in marketing and advertising by enhancing visual communication and brand visibility, making significant contributions to industrial design. With the latest advancements in controllable T2I diffusion models, increasing research has focused on rendering text within synthesized images. Despite improvements in text rendering accuracy, the field of automatic poster generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an automatic poster generation framework with text rendering capabilities leveraging LLMs, utilizing a triple-cross attention mechanism based on alignment learning. This framework aims to create precise poster text within a detailed contextual background. Additionally, the framework supports controllable fonts, adjustable image resolution, and the rendering of posters with descriptions and text in both English and Chinese.Furthermore, we introduce a high-resolution font dataset and a poster dataset with resolutions exceeding 1024 pixels. Our approach leverages the SDXL architecture. Extensive experiments validate our method's capability in generating poster images with complex and contextually rich backgrounds.Codes is available at https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/GlyphDraw2.</description>

      <title>VIPeR: Visual Incremental Place Recognition with Adaptive Mining and Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of many autonomous and augmented/virtual reality systems. It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have profoundly transformed the field of remote sensing, revolutionizing data collection, processing, and analysis. Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing research has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models-large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain. We categorize these models based on their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies. Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by those foundation models. Additionally, we discuss technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization. Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, remarkably enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models. This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for generating video sequences with coherent motion between a pair of input key frames. We adapt a pretrained large-scale image-to-video diffusion model (originally trained to generate videos moving forward in time from a single input image) for key frame interpolation, i.e., to produce a video in between two input frames. We accomplish this adaptation through a lightweight fine-tuning technique that produces a version of the model that instead predicts videos moving backwards in time from a single input image. This model (along with the original forward-moving model) is subsequently used in a dual-directional diffusion sampling process that combines the overlapping model estimates starting from each of the two keyframes. Our experiments show that our method outperforms both existing diffusion-based methods and traditional frame interpolation techniques.</description>

Abstract: Recently, visual grounding and multi-sensors setting have been incorporated into perception system for terrestrial autonomous driving systems and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), yet the high complexity of modern learning-based visual grounding model using multi-sensors prevents such model to be deployed on USVs in the real-life. To this end, we design a low-power multi-task model named NanoMVG for waterway embodied perception, guiding both camera and 4D millimeter-wave radar to locate specific object(s) through natural language. NanoMVG can perform both box-level and mask-level visual grounding tasks simultaneously. Compared to other visual grounding models, NanoMVG achieves highly competitive performance on the WaterVG dataset, particularly in harsh environments and boasts ultra-low power consumption for long endurance.</description>

      <title>Sparsity Meets Similarity: Leveraging Long-Tail Distribution for Dynamic Optimized Token Representation in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) have achieved significant success in various tasks, but their high computational costs limit widespread application. The main computational burden arises from processing concatenated text and visual tokens in the LLM layer, where input token length directly affects efficiency. Our analysis of visual tokens reveals that their similarity to the CLS token follows a long-tail distribution, with only a few showing high similarity. To address this, we propose a dynamic pruning algorithm that identifies the inflection point in the visual CLS token similarity curve, enabling effective trimming of visual markers to accelerate model performance. Additionally, we perform a second round of pruning in the LLM layer, filtering out low-correlation tokens through the interaction between visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to the original while utilizing only 22% of the original token quantity. Our source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>TASAR: Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02483v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skeletal sequence data, as a widely employed representation of human actions, are crucial in Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Recently, adversarial attacks have been proposed in this area, which exposes potential security concerns, and more importantly provides a good tool for model robustness test. Within this research, transfer-based attack is an important tool as it mimics the real-world scenario where an attacker has no knowledge of the target model, but is under-explored in Skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR). Consequently, existing S-HAR attacks exhibit weak adversarial transferability and the reason remains largely unknown. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon via the characterization of the loss function. We find that one prominent indicator of poor transferability is the low smoothness of the loss function. Led by this observation, we improve the transferability by properly smoothening the loss when computing the adversarial examples. This leads to the first Transfer-based Attack on Skeletal Action Recognition, TASAR. TASAR explores the smoothened model posterior of pre-trained surrogates, which is achieved by a new post-train Dual Bayesian optimization strategy. Furthermore, unlike existing transfer-based methods which overlook the temporal coherence within sequences, TASAR incorporates motion dynamics into the Bayesian attack, effectively disrupting the spatial-temporal coherence of S-HARs. For exhaustive evaluation, we build the first large-scale robust S-HAR benchmark, comprising 7 S-HAR models, 10 attack methods, 3 S-HAR datasets and 2 defense models. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of TASAR. Our benchmark enables easy comparisons for future studies, with the code available in the https://github.com/yunfengdiao/Skeleton-Robustness-Benchmark.</description>

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects children's social and communication abilities, with eye-tracking widely used to identify atypical gaze patterns. While unsupervised clustering can automate the creation of areas of interest for gaze feature extraction, the use of internal cluster validity indices, like Silhouette Coefficient, to distinguish gaze pattern differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) children remains underexplored. We explore whether internal cluster validity indices can distinguish ASD from TD children. Specifically, we apply seven clustering algorithms to gaze points and extract 63 internal cluster validity indices to reveal correlations with ASD diagnosis. Using these indices, we train predictive models for ASD diagnosis. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate high predictive accuracy (81\% AUC), validating the effectiveness of these indices.</description>

      <title>Advancing Medical Radiograph Representation Learning: A Hybrid Pre-training Paradigm with Multilevel Semantic Granularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) area in the specialized context of radiograph representation learning. While conventional methods frequently merge textual annotations into unified reports, we acknowledge the intrinsic hierarchical relationship between the findings and impression section in radiograph datasets. To establish a targeted correspondence between images and texts, we propose a novel HybridMED framework to align global-level visual representations with impression and token-level visual representations with findings. Moreover, our framework incorporates a generation decoder that employs two proxy tasks, responsible for generating the impression from (1) images, via a captioning branch, and (2) findings, through a summarization branch. Additionally, knowledge distillation is leveraged to facilitate the training process. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset reveal that our summarization branch effectively distills knowledge to the captioning branch, enhancing model performance without significantly increasing parameter requirements due to the shared self-attention and feed-forward architecture.</description>

      <title>MiraGe: Editable 2D Images using Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values, capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently, GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in 3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing. Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world. Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of 2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard approach and natural modification of 2D images</description>

      <title>Robust Visual Representation Learning with Multi-modal Prior Knowledge for Image Classification Under Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision, they fail to remain high-performing when facing distribution shifts between training and testing data. In this paper, we propose Knowledge-Guided Visual representation learning (KGV) - a distribution-based learning approach leveraging multi-modal prior knowledge - to improve generalization under distribution shift. It integrates knowledge from two distinct modalities: 1) a knowledge graph (KG) with hierarchical and association relationships; and 2) generated synthetic images of visual elements semantically represented in the KG. The respective embeddings are generated from the given modalities in a common latent space, i.e., visual embeddings from original and synthetic images as well as knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). These embeddings are aligned via a novel variant of translation-based KGE methods, where the node and relation embeddings of the KG are modeled as Gaussian distributions and translations, respectively. We claim that incorporating multi-model prior knowledge enables more regularized learning of image representations. Thus, the models are able to better generalize across different data distributions. We evaluate KGV on different image classification tasks with major or minor distribution shifts, namely road sign classification across datasets from Germany, China, and Russia, image classification with the mini-ImageNet dataset and its variants, as well as the DVM-CAR dataset. The results demonstrate that KGV consistently exhibits higher accuracy and data efficiency across all experiments.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning without Backpropagation using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for Image Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel supervised learning approach for spiking neural networks that does not rely on traditional backpropagation. Instead, it employs spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) within a supervised framework for image recognition tasks. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves approximately 40\% learning accuracy with just 10 training stimuli, where each category is exposed to the model only once during training (one-shot learning). With larger training samples, the accuracy increases up to 87\%, maintaining negligible ambiguity. Notably, with only 10 hidden neurons, the model reaches 89\% accuracy with around 10\% ambiguity. This proposed method offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional backpropagation-based supervised learning techniques.</description>

      <title>TimeSuite: Improving MLLMs for Long Video Understanding via Grounded Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding. However, understanding long-form videos still remains challenging for MLLMs. This paper proposes TimeSuite, a collection of new designs to adapt the existing short-form video MLLMs for long video understanding, including a simple yet efficient framework to process long video sequence, a high-quality video dataset for grounded tuning of MLLMs, and a carefully-designed instruction tuning task to explicitly incorporate the grounding supervision in the traditional QA format. Specifically, based on VideoChat, we propose our long-video MLLM, coined as VideoChat-T, by implementing a token shuffling to compress long video tokens and introducing Temporal Adaptive Position Encoding (TAPE) to enhance the temporal awareness of visual representation. Meanwhile, we introduce the TimePro, a comprehensive grounding-centric instruction tuning dataset composed of 9 tasks and 349k high-quality grounded annotations. Notably, we design a new instruction tuning task type, called Temporal Grounded Caption, to peform detailed video descriptions with the corresponding time stamps prediction. This explicit temporal location prediction will guide MLLM to correctly attend on the visual content when generating description, and thus reduce the hallucination risk caused by the LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our TimeSuite provides a successful solution to enhance the long video understanding capability of short-form MLLM, achieving improvement of 5.6% and 6.8% on the benchmarks of Egoschema and VideoMME, respectively. In addition, VideoChat-T exhibits robust zero-shot temporal grounding capabilities, significantly outperforming the existing state-of-the-art MLLMs. After fine-tuning, it performs on par with the traditional supervised expert models.</description>

      <title>BlueSuffix: Reinforced Blue Teaming for Vision-Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends target VLMs against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance under black-box setting. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator using reinforcement fine-tuning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on four VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructionBLIP, and Gemini) and four safety benchmarks (Harmful Instruction, AdvBench, MM-SafetyBench, and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/Vinsonzyh/BlueSuffix.</description>

      <title>Toddlers' Active Gaze Behavior Supports Self-Supervised Object Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toddlers learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints with almost no supervision. Recent works argue that toddlers develop this ability by mapping close-in-time visual inputs to similar representations while interacting with objects. High acuity vision is only available in the central visual field, which May explain why toddlers (much like adults) constantly move around their gaze during such interactions. It is unclear whether/how much toddlers curate their visual experience through these eye movements to support their learning of object representations. In this work, we explore whether a bio-inspired visual learning model can harness toddlers' gaze behavior during a play session to develop view-invariant object recognition. Exploiting head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play, we simulate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions centered on the gaze location. This visual stream feeds time-based self-supervised learning algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also reveals that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. We further find that toddlers' visual experience elicits more robust representations compared to adults', mostly because toddlers look at objects they hold themselves for longer bouts. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior supports self-supervised learning of view-invariant object recognition.</description>

      <title>GMem: A Modular Approach for Ultra-Efficient Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that the denoising process in deep generative diffusion models implicitly learns and memorizes semantic information from the data distribution. These findings suggest that capturing more complex data distributions requires larger neural networks, leading to a substantial increase in computational demands, which in turn become the primary bottleneck in both training and inference of diffusion models. To this end, we introduce GMem: A Modular Approach for Ultra-Efficient Generative Models. Our approach GMem decouples the memory capacity from model and implements it as a separate, immutable memory set that preserves the essential semantic information in the data. The results are significant: GMem enhances both training, sampling efficiency, and diversity generation. This design on one hand reduces the reliance on network for memorize complex data distribution and thus enhancing both training and sampling efficiency. On ImageNet at $256 \times 256$ resolution, GMem achieves a $50\times$ training speedup compared to SiT, reaching FID $=7.66$ in fewer than $28$ epochs ($\sim 4$ hours training time), while SiT requires $1400$ epochs. Without classifier-free guidance, GMem achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance FID $=1.53$ in $160$ epochs with only $\sim 20$ hours of training, outperforming LightningDiT which requires $800$ epochs and $\sim 95$ hours to attain FID $=2.17$.</description>

      <title>All You Need in Knowledge Distillation Is a Tailored Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential in transferring dark knowledge from a large teacher to a small student network, such that the student can be much more efficient than the teacher but with comparable accuracy. Existing KD methods, however, rely on a large teacher trained specifically for the target task, which is both very inflexible and inefficient. In this paper, we argue that a SSL-pretrained model can effectively act as the teacher and its dark knowledge can be captured by the coordinate system or linear subspace where the features lie in. We then need only one forward pass of the teacher, and then tailor the coordinate system (TCS) for the student network. Our TCS method is teacher-free and applies to diverse architectures, works well for KD and practical few-shot learning, and allows cross-architecture distillation with large capacity gap. Experiments show that TCS achieves significantly higher accuracy than state-of-the-art KD methods, while only requiring roughly half of their training time and GPU memory costs.</description>

      <title>Gramian Multimodal Representation Learning and Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human perception integrates multiple modalities, such as vision, hearing, and language, into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification. The project page, the code, and the pretrained models are available at https://ispamm.github.io/GRAM/.</description>

      <title>WeatherGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction in Adverse Weather Conditions via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for 3D scene reconstruction, but still suffers from complex outdoor environments, especially under adverse weather. This is because 3DGS treats the artifacts caused by adverse weather as part of the scene and will directly reconstruct them, largely reducing the clarity of the reconstructed scene. To address this challenge, we propose WeatherGS, a 3DGS-based framework for reconstructing clear scenes from multi-view images under different weather conditions. Specifically, we explicitly categorize the multi-weather artifacts into the dense particles and lens occlusions that have very different characters, in which the former are caused by snowflakes and raindrops in the air, and the latter are raised by the precipitation on the camera lens. In light of this, we propose a dense-to-sparse preprocess strategy, which sequentially removes the dense particles by an Atmospheric Effect Filter (AEF) and then extracts the relatively sparse occlusion masks with a Lens Effect Detector (LED). Finally, we train a set of 3D Gaussians by the processed images and generated masks for excluding occluded areas, and accurately recover the underlying clear scene by Gaussian splatting. We conduct a diverse and challenging benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of 3D reconstruction under complex weather scenarios. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that our WeatherGS consistently produces high-quality, clean scenes across various weather scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While mainstream vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly in understanding image level information, they still lack the ability to focus on specific areas designated by humans. Rather, they typically rely on large volumes of high-quality image-text paired data to learn and generate posterior attention maps. To address this critical issue, we propose leveraging visual prompts:simple visual markers in various forms to guide and enhance the formation of region-specific attention. Thus, we introduce MedVP, a pioneering framework that integrates medical entity extraction, visual prompt generation, and dataset adaptation for visual prompt guided fine-tuning. We successfully outperform recent state-of-the-art large models across multiple medical VQA datasets. Extensive experiments and Human evaluation are conducted to analyze the impact of different visual prompt forms and how they contribute to performance improvement. The results demonstrate both the effectiveness and clinical significance of our approach.</description>

      <title>DGQ: Distribution-Aware Group Quantization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread use of text-to-image diffusion models across various tasks, their computational and memory demands limit practical applications. To mitigate this issue, quantization of diffusion models has been explored. It reduces memory usage and computational costs by compressing weights and activations into lower-bit formats. However, existing methods often struggle to preserve both image quality and text-image alignment, particularly in lower-bit($&lt;$ 8bits) quantization. In this paper, we analyze the challenges associated with quantizing text-to-image diffusion models from a distributional perspective. Our analysis reveals that activation outliers play a crucial role in determining image quality. Additionally, we identify distinctive patterns in cross-attention scores, which significantly affects text-image alignment. To address these challenges, we propose Distribution-aware Group Quantization (DGQ), a method that identifies and adaptively handles pixel-wise and channel-wise outliers to preserve image quality. Furthermore, DGQ applies prompt-specific logarithmic quantization scales to maintain text-image alignment. Our method demonstrates remarkable performance on datasets such as MS-COCO and PartiPrompts. We are the first to successfully achieve low-bit quantization of text-to-image diffusion models without requiring additional fine-tuning of weight quantization parameters.

      <title>MARIO: A Mixed Annotation Framework For Polyp Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing polyp segmentation models are limited by high labeling costs and the small size of datasets. Additionally, vast polyp datasets remain underutilized because these models typically rely on a single type of annotation. To address this dilemma, we introduce MARIO, a mixed supervision model designed to accommodate various annotation types, significantly expanding the range of usable data. MARIO learns from underutilized datasets by incorporating five forms of supervision: pixel-level, box-level, polygon-level, scribblelevel, and point-level. Each form of supervision is associated with a tailored loss that effectively leverages the supervision labels while minimizing the noise. This allows MARIO to move beyond the constraints of relying on a single annotation type. Furthermore, MARIO primarily utilizes dataset with weak and cheap annotations, reducing the dependence on large-scale, fully annotated ones. Experimental results across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIO consistently outperforms existing methods, highlighting its efficacy in balancing trade-offs between different forms of supervision and maximizing polyp segmentation performance</description>

      <title>Advancing General Multimodal Capability of Vision-language Models with Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in advancing general artificial intelligence, yet the irrational encoding of visual positions persists in inhibiting the models' comprehensive perception performance across different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose Pyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to enhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual position indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central receptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional raster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between interrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational allocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception of visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that PyPE consistently improves the general capabilities of VLMs across various sizes.

      <title>PAID: A Framework of Product-Centric Advertising Image Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating visually appealing advertising images is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Is it possible to automatically generate such images using only basic product information--specifically, a product foreground image, taglines, and a target size? Existing methods mainly focus on parts of the problem and fail to provide a comprehensive solution. To address this gap, we propose a novel multistage framework called Product-Centric Advertising Image Design (PAID). It consists of four sequential stages to highlight product foregrounds and taglines while achieving overall image aesthetics: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are designed and trained for the first three stages: First, we use a visual language model (VLM) to generate background prompts that match the products. Next, a VLM-based layout generation model arranges the placement of product foregrounds, graphic elements (taglines and decorative underlays), and various nongraphic elements (objects from the background prompt). Following this, we train an SDXL-based image generation model that can simultaneously accept prompts, layouts, and foreground controls. To support the PAID framework, we create corresponding datasets with over 50,000 labeled images. Extensive experimental results and online A/B tests demonstrate that PAID can produce more visually appealing advertising images.</description>

      <title>Surface Vision Mamba: Leveraging Bidirectional State Space Model for Efficient Spherical Manifold Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

      <title>Generating crossmodal gene expression from cancer histopathology improves multimodal AI predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging research has highlighted that artificial intelligence based multimodal fusion of digital pathology and transcriptomic features can improve cancer diagnosis (grading/subtyping) and prognosis (survival risk) prediction. However, such direct fusion for joint decision is impractical in real clinical settings, where histopathology is still the gold standard for diagnosis and transcriptomic tests are rarely requested, at least in the public healthcare system. With our novel diffusion based crossmodal generative AI model PathGen, we show that genomic expressions synthesized from digital histopathology jointly predicts cancer grading and patient survival risk with high accuracy (state-of-the-art performance), certainty (through conformal coverage guarantee) and interpretability (through distributed attention maps). PathGen code is available for open use by the research community through GitHub at https://github.com/Samiran-Dey/PathGen.</description>

      <title>One Diffusion Step to Real-World Super-Resolution via Flow Trajectory Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of multi-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</description>

      <title>Ola: Pushing the Frontiers of Omni-Modal Language Model with Progressive Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, particularly following GPT-4o, have sparked increasing interest in developing omni-modal models capable of understanding more modalities. While some open-source alternatives have emerged, there is still a notable lag behind specialized single-modality models in performance. In this paper, we present Ola, an Omni-modal language model that achieves competitive performance across image, video, and audio understanding compared to specialized counterparts. The core design of Ola lies in its progressive modality alignment strategy that extends the supporting modality of the language model progressively. Our training pipeline begins with the most distinct modalities: image and text, then gradually expands the skill sets of the model using speech data that connects language and audio knowledge, and video data that connects all modalities. The progressive learning pipeline also enables us to maintain a relatively small size of the cross-modal alignment data, making developing omni-modal from existing vision-language models easy and less costly. Moreover, to unlock an advanced interactive experience like GPT-4o, we further design a sentence-wise decoding solution for streaming speech generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ola surpasses existing open omni-modal LLMs across all modalities while achieving highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art specialized models of similar sizes. We aim to make Ola a fully open omni-modal understanding solution to advance future research in this emerging field. Model weights, code, and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/Ola-Omni/Ola.</description>

      <title>Survey on AI-Generated Media Detection: From Non-MLLM to MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated media poses significant challenges to information authenticity and social trust, making reliable detection methods highly demanded. Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly, paralleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups: Non-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision, domain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter utilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity verification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite significant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding a comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to general-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a systematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and multi-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these categories, examining their methodological similarities and differences. Through this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key challenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research. Additionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks, ethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns. We examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across various jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this field.</description>

      <title>A Novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time Object Detection using 4D Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate 3D object detection is crucial for safe autonomous navigation, requiring reliable performance across diverse weather conditions. While LiDAR performance deteriorates in challenging weather, Radar systems maintain their reliability. Traditional Radars have limitations due to their lack of elevation data, but the recent 4D Radars overcome this by measuring elevation alongside range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity, making them invaluable for autonomous vehicles. The primary challenge in utilizing 4D Radars is the sparsity of their point clouds. Previous works address this by developing architectures that better capture semantics and context in sparse point cloud, largely drawing from LiDAR-based approaches. However, these methods often overlook a unique advantage of 4D Radars: the dense Radar tensor, which encapsulates power measurements across three spatial dimensions and the Doppler dimension. Our paper leverages this tensor to tackle the sparsity issue. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables a student model to densify its sparse input in the latent space by emulating an ensemble of teacher models. Our experiments demonstrate a 25% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art RTNH model on the K-Radar dataset. Notably, this improvement is achieved while still maintaining a real-time inference speed.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating the material appearance of objects in images is critical for applications like augmented reality, virtual prototyping, and digital content creation. We present MaterialFusion, a novel framework for high-quality material transfer that allows users to adjust the degree of material application, achieving an optimal balance between new material properties and the object's original features. MaterialFusion seamlessly integrates the modified object into the scene by maintaining background consistency and mitigating boundary artifacts. To thoroughly evaluate our approach, we have compiled a dataset of real-world material transfer examples and conducted complex comparative analyses. Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and user studies, we demonstrate that MaterialFusion significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of quality, user control, and background preservation.

      <title>Lumina-Video: Efficient and Flexible Video Generation with Multi-scale Next-DiT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have established Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) as a dominant framework in generative modeling. Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos. Codes are released at https://www.github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Video.</description>

      <title>Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent Diffusion Model for Compressed Video Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to limitations of storage and bandwidth, videos stored and transmitted on the Internet are usually low-quality with low-resolution and compression noise. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Autoregressive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Adapt then Unlearn: Exploring Parameter Space Semantics for Unlearning in Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Owing to the growing concerns about privacy and regulatory compliance, it is desirable to regulate the output of generative models. To that end, the objective of this work is to prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) where the underlying training data set is inaccessible. Our approach is inspired by the observation that the parameter space of GANs exhibits meaningful directions that can be leveraged to suppress specific undesired features. However, such directions usually result in the degradation of the quality of generated samples. Our proposed two-stage method, known as 'Adapt-then-Unlearn,' excels at unlearning such undesirable features while also maintaining the quality of generated samples. In the initial stage, we adapt a pre-trained GAN on a set of negative samples (containing undesired features) provided by the user. Subsequently, we train the original pre-trained GAN using positive samples, along with a repulsion regularizer. This regularizer encourages the learned model parameters to move away from the parameters of the adapted model (first stage) while not degrading the generation quality. We provide theoretical insights into the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, our approach stands as the first method addressing unlearning within the realm of high-fidelity GANs (such as StyleGAN). We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments, encompassing both class-level unlearning on the MNIST and AFHQ dataset and feature-level unlearning tasks on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Our code and implementation is available at: https://github.com/atriguha/Adapt_Unlearn.</description>

      <title>Robotic Grasping of Harvested Tomato Trusses Using Vision and Online Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently, truss tomato weighing and packaging require significant manual work. The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest. The method consists of a deep learning-based vision system to first identify the individual trusses in the crate and then determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. To this end, we have introduced a grasp pose ranking algorithm with online learning capabilities. After selecting the most promising grasp pose, the robot executes a pinch grasp without needing touch sensors or geometric models. Lab experiments with a robotic manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera showed a 100% clearance rate when tasked to pick all trusses from a pile. 93% of the trusses were successfully grasped on the first try, while the remaining 7% required more attempts.</description>

      <title>Deep Spatiotemporal Clutter Filtering of Transthoracic Echocardiographic Images: Leveraging Contextual Attention and Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep convolutional autoencoder network for filtering reverberation clutter from transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image sequences. Given the spatiotemporal nature of this type of clutter, the filtering network employs 3D convolutional layers to suppress it throughout the cardiac cycle. The design of the network incorporates two key features that contribute to the effectiveness of the filter: 1) an attention mechanism for focusing on cluttered regions and leveraging contextual information, and 2) residual learning for preserving fine image structures. To train the network, a diverse set of artifact patterns was simulated and superimposed onto ultra-realistic synthetic TTE sequences from six ultrasound vendors, generating input for the filtering network. The artifact-free sequences served as ground-truth. Performance of the filtering network was evaluated using unseen synthetic and in vivo artifactual sequences. Results from the in vivo dataset confirmed the network's strong generalization capabilities, despite being trained solely on synthetic data and simulated artifacts. The suitability of the filtered sequences for downstream processing was assessed by computing segmental strain curves. A significant reduction in the discrepancy between strain profiles computed from cluttered and clutter-free segments was observed after filtering the cluttered sequences with the proposed network. The trained network processes a TTE sequence in a fraction of a second, enabling real-time clutter filtering and potentially improving the precision of clinically relevant indices derived from TTE sequences. The source code of the proposed method and example video files of the filtering results are available at: \href{https://github.com/MahdiTabassian/Deep-Clutter-Filtering/tree/main}{https://github.com/MahdiTabassian/Deep-Clutter-Filtering/tree/main}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning With Sine-Activated Low-rank Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank decomposition has emerged as a vital tool for enhancing parameter efficiency in neural network architectures, gaining traction across diverse applications in machine learning. These techniques significantly lower the number of parameters, striking a balance between compactness and performance. However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model performance. Our method proves to be a plug in enhancement for existing low-rank models, as evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large Language Models (LLMs), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D shape modelling.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent. MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIA's ability to describe (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying inputs likely to be mis-classified.</description>

      <title>X-Diffusion: Generating Detailed 3D MRI Volumes From a Single Image Using Cross-Sectional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial diagnostic tool, but high-resolution scans are often slow and expensive due to extensive data acquisition requirements. Traditional MRI reconstruction methods aim to expedite this process by filling in missing frequency components in the K-space, performing 3D-to-3D reconstructions that demand full 3D scans. In contrast, we introduce X-Diffusion, a novel cross-sectional diffusion model that reconstructs detailed 3D MRI volumes from extremely sparse spatial-domain inputs, achieving 2D-to-3D reconstruction from as little as a single 2D MRI slice or few slices. A key aspect of X-Diffusion is that it models MRI data as holistic 3D volumes during the cross-sectional training and inference, unlike previous learning approaches that treat MRI scans as collections of 2D slices in standard planes (coronal, axial, sagittal). We evaluated X-Diffusion on brain tumor MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Our results demonstrate that X-Diffusion not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in quantitative accuracy (PSNR) on unseen data but also preserves critical anatomical features such as tumor profiles, spine curvature, and brain volume. Remarkably, the model generalizes beyond the training domain, successfully reconstructing knee MRIs despite being trained exclusively on brain data. Medical expert evaluations further confirm the clinical relevance and fidelity of the generated images.To our knowledge, X-Diffusion is the first method capable of producing detailed 3D MRIs from highly limited 2D input data, potentially accelerating MRI acquisition and reducing associated costs. The code is available on the project website https://emmanuelleb985.github.io/XDiffusion/ .</description>

      <title>Similarity and Quality Metrics for MR Image-To-Image Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08431v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation can create large impact in medical imaging, as images can be synthetically transformed to other modalities, sequence types, higher resolutions or lower noise levels. To ensure patient safety, these methods should be validated by human readers, which requires a considerable amount of time and costs. Quantitative metrics can effectively complement such studies and provide reproducible and objective assessment of synthetic images. If a reference is available, the similarity of MR images is frequently evaluated by SSIM and PSNR metrics, even though these metrics are not or too sensitive regarding specific distortions. When reference images to compare with are not available, non-reference quality metrics can reliably detect specific distortions, such as blurriness. To provide an overview on distortion sensitivity, we quantitatively analyze 11 similarity (reference) and 12 quality (non-reference) metrics for assessing synthetic images. We additionally include a metric on a downstream segmentation task. We investigate the sensitivity regarding 11 kinds of distortions and typical MR artifacts, and analyze the influence of different normalization methods on each metric and distortion. Finally, we derive recommendations for effective usage of the analyzed similarity and quality metrics for evaluation of image-to-image translation models.</description>

      <title>Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code is made publicly available: https://github.com/valeoai/MF_aWTA.</description>

      <title>Observe Then Act: Asynchronous Active Vision-Action Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, many robotic manipulation tasks are hindered by occlusions and limited fields of view, posing significant challenges for passive observation-based models that rely on fixed or wrist-mounted cameras. In this paper, we investigate the problem of robotic manipulation under limited visual observation and propose a task-driven asynchronous active vision-action model.Our model serially connects a camera Next-Best-View (NBV) policy with a gripper Next-Best Pose (NBP) policy, and trains them in a sensor-motor coordination framework using few-shot reinforcement learning. This approach allows the agent to adjust a third-person camera to actively observe the environment based on the task goal, and subsequently infer the appropriate manipulation actions.We trained and evaluated our model on 8 viewpoint-constrained tasks in RLBench. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline algorithms, showcasing its effectiveness in handling visual constraints in manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Sketched Equivariant Imaging Regularization and Deep Internal Learning for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05771v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant Imaging (EI) regularization has become the de-facto technique for unsupervised training of deep imaging networks, without any need of ground-truth data. Observing that the EI-based unsupervised training paradigm currently has significant computational redundancy leading to inefficiency in high-dimensional applications, we propose a sketched EI regularization which leverages the randomized sketching techniques for acceleration. We then extend our sketched EI regularization to develop an accelerated deep internal learning framework, Sketched Equivariant Deep Image Prior (Sk-EI-DIP), which can be efficiently applied for single-image and task-adapted reconstruction. Additionally, for network adaptation tasks, we propose a parameter-efficient approach for accelerating both EI-DIP and Sk-EI-DIP via optimizing only the normalization layers. Our numerical study on X-ray CT and multi-coil MRI image reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computational acceleration over standard EI-based counterpart in single-input setting and network adaptation at test time.</description>

      <title>In-Context Experience Replay Facilitates Safety Red-Teaming of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have shown remarkable progress, but their potential to generate harmful content remains a critical concern in the ML community. While various safety mechanisms have been developed, the field lacks systematic tools for evaluating their effectiveness against real-world misuse scenarios. In this work, we propose ICER, a novel red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and a bandit optimization-based algorithm to generate interpretable and semantic meaningful problematic prompts by learning from past successful red-teaming attempts. Our ICER efficiently probes safety mechanisms across different T2I models without requiring internal access or additional training, making it broadly applicable to deployed systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICER significantly outperforms existing prompt attack methods in identifying model vulnerabilities while maintaining high semantic similarity with intended content. By uncovering that successful jailbreaking instances can systematically facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities, our work provides crucial insights for developing more robust safety mechanisms in T2I systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.</description>

      <title>Safety at Scale: A Comprehensive Survey of Large Model Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Video Analytics in Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of video data has driven the development of distributed video analytics in cloud-edge-terminal collaborative (CETC) systems, enabling efficient video processing, real-time inference, and privacy-preserving analysis. Among multiple advantages, CETC systems can distribute video processing tasks and enable adaptive analytics across cloud, edge, and terminal devices, leading to breakthroughs in video surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart cities. In this survey, we first analyze fundamental architectural components, including hierarchical, distributed, and hybrid frameworks, alongside edge computing platforms and resource management mechanisms. Building upon these foundations, edge-centric approaches emphasize on-device processing, edge-assisted offloading, and edge intelligence, while cloud-centric methods leverage powerful computational capabilities for complex video understanding and model training. Our investigation also covers hybrid video analytics incorporating adaptive task offloading and resource-aware scheduling techniques that optimize performance across the entire system. Beyond conventional approaches, recent advances in large language models and multimodal integration reveal both opportunities and challenges in platform scalability, data protection, and system reliability. Future directions also encompass explainable systems, efficient processing mechanisms, and advanced video analytics, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in this dynamic field.</description>

      <title>Space-Aware Instruction Tuning: Dataset and Benchmark for Guide Dog Robots Assisting the Visually Impaired</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</description>
