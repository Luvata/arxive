      <title>COutfitGAN: Learning to Synthesize Compatible Outfits Supervised by Silhouette Masks and Fashion Styles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to recommend outfits has gained considerable attention in both academia and industry in recent years. Many studies have been carried out regarding fashion compatibility learning, to determine whether the fashion items in an outfit are compatible or not. These methods mainly focus on evaluating the compatibility of existing outfits and rarely consider applying such knowledge to 'design' new fashion items. We propose the new task of generating complementary and compatible fashion items based on an arbitrary number of given fashion items. In particular, given some fashion items that can make up an outfit, the aim of this paper is to synthesize photo-realistic images of other, complementary, fashion items that are compatible with the given ones. To achieve this, we propose an outfit generation framework, referred to as COutfitGAN, which includes a pyramid style extractor, an outfit generator, a UNet-based real/fake discriminator, and a collocation discriminator. To train and evaluate this framework, we collected a large-scale fashion outfit dataset with over 200K outfits and 800K fashion items from the Internet. Extensive experiments show that COutfitGAN outperforms other baselines in terms of similarity, authenticity, and compatibility measurements.</description>

      <title>Multispectral Remote Sensing for Weed Detection in West Australian Agricultural Lands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondinin region in Western Australia faces significant agricultural challenges due to pervasive weed infestations, causing economic losses and ecological impacts. This study constructs a tailored multispectral remote sensing dataset and an end-to-end framework for weed detection to advance precision agriculture practices. Unmanned aerial vehicles were used to collect raw multispectral data from two experimental areas (E2 and E8) over four years, covering 0.6046 km^{2} and ground truth annotations were created with GPS-enabled vehicles to manually label weeds and crops. The dataset is specifically designed for agricultural applications in Western Australia. We propose an end-to-end framework for weed detection that includes extensive preprocessing steps, such as denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and stitching. The proposed method combines vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) with multispectral channels to form classification features, and employs several deep learning models to identify weeds based on the input features. Among these models, ResNet achieves the highest performance, with a weed detection accuracy of 0.9213, an F1-Score of 0.8735, an mIOU of 0.7888, and an mDC of 0.8865, validating the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed weed detection method.</description>

      <title>HistoSmith: Single-Stage Histology Image-Label Generation via Conditional Latent Diffusion for Enhanced Cell Segmentation and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise segmentation and classification of cell instances are vital for analyzing the tissue microenvironment in histology images, supporting medical diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and studies of brain cytoarchitecture. However, the creation of high-quality annotated datasets for training remains a major challenge. This study introduces a novel single-stage approach (HistoSmith) for generating image-label pairs to augment histology datasets. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that utilize diffusion models with separate components for label and image generation, our approach employs a latent diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of cellular layouts, classification masks, and histology images. This model enables tailored data generation by conditioning on user-defined parameters such as cell types, quantities, and tissue types. Trained on the Conic H&amp;E histopathology dataset and the Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset, the model generates realistic and diverse labeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in cell instance segmentation and classification, particularly for underrepresented cell types like neutrophils in the Conic dataset. These findings underscore the potential of our approach to address data scarcity challenges.</description>

      <title>Cluster and Predict Latents Patches for Improved Masked Image Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) offers a promising approach to self-supervised representation learning, however existing MIM models still lag behind the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically analyze target representations, loss functions, and architectures, to introduce CAPI - a novel pure-MIM framework that relies on the prediction of latent clusterings. Our approach leverages a clustering-based loss, which is stable to train, and exhibits promising scaling properties. Our ViT-L backbone, CAPI, achieves 83.8% accuracy on ImageNet and 32.1% mIoU on ADE20K with simple linear probes, substantially outperforming previous MIM methods and approaching the performance of the current state-of-the-art, DINOv2. We release all our code and models.</description>

      <title>Exploring Test Time Adaptation for Subcortical Segmentation of the Fetal Brain in 3D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring the growth of subcortical regions of the fetal brain in ultrasound (US) images can help identify the presence of abnormal development. Manually segmenting these regions is a challenging task, but recent work has shown that it can be automated using deep learning. However, applying pretrained models to unseen freehand US volumes often leads to a degradation of performance due to the vast differences in acquisition and alignment. In this work, we first demonstrate that test time adaptation (TTA) can be used to improve model performance in the presence of both real and simulated domain shifts. We further propose a novel TTA method by incorporating a normative atlas as a prior for anatomy. In the presence of various types of domain shifts, we benchmark the performance of different TTA methods and demonstrate the improvements brought by our proposed approach, which may further facilitate automated monitoring of fetal brain development. Our code is available at https://github.com/joshuaomolegan/TTA-for-3D-Fetal-Subcortical-Segmentation.</description>

      <title>SB-Bench: Stereotype Bias Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereotype biases in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) perpetuate harmful societal prejudices, undermining the fairness and equity of AI applications. As LMMs grow increasingly influential, addressing and mitigating inherent biases related to stereotypes, harmful generations, and ambiguous assumptions in real-world scenarios has become essential. However, existing datasets evaluating stereotype biases in LMMs often lack diversity and rely on synthetic images, leaving a gap in bias evaluation for real-world visual contexts. To address this, we introduce the Stereotype Bias Benchmark (SB-bench), the most comprehensive framework to date for assessing stereotype biases across nine diverse categories with non-synthetic images. SB-bench rigorously evaluates LMMs through carefully curated, visually grounded scenarios, challenging them to reason accurately about visual stereotypes. It offers a robust evaluation framework featuring real-world visual samples, image variations, and multiple-choice question formats. By introducing visually grounded queries that isolate visual biases from textual ones, SB-bench enables a precise and nuanced assessment of a model's reasoning capabilities across varying levels of difficulty. Through rigorous testing of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source LMMs, SB-bench provides a systematic approach to assessing stereotype biases in LMMs across key social dimensions. This benchmark represents a significant step toward fostering fairness in AI systems and reducing harmful biases, laying the groundwork for more equitable and socially responsible LMMs. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Measuring Anxiety Levels with Head Motion Patterns in Severe Depression Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental health disorders that frequently cooccur, with anxiety significantly influencing both the manifestation and treatment of depression. An accurate assessment of anxiety levels in individuals with depression is crucial to develop effective and personalized treatment plans. This study proposes a new noninvasive method for quantifying anxiety severity by analyzing head movements -specifically speed, acceleration, and angular displacement - during video-recorded interviews with patients suffering from severe depression. Using data from a new CALYPSO Depression Dataset, we extracted head motion characteristics and applied regression analysis to predict clinically evaluated anxiety levels. Our results demonstrate a high level of precision, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.35 in predicting the severity of psychological anxiety based on head movement patterns. This indicates that our approach can enhance the understanding of anxiety's role in depression and assist psychiatrists in refining treatment strategies for individuals.</description>

      <title>DejAIvu: Identifying and Explaining AI Art on the Web in Real-Time with Saliency Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent surge in advanced generative models, such as diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs), has led to an alarming rise in AI-generated images across various domains on the web. While such technologies offer benefits such as democratizing artistic creation, they also pose challenges in misinformation, digital forgery, and authenticity verification. Additionally, the uncredited use of AI-generated images in media and marketing has sparked significant backlash from online communities. In response to this, we introduce DejAIvu, a Chrome Web extension that combines real-time AI-generated image detection with saliency-based explainability while users browse the web. Using an ONNX-optimized deep learning model, DejAIvu automatically analyzes images on websites such as Google Images, identifies AI-generated content using model inference, and overlays a saliency heatmap to highlight AI-related artifacts. Our approach integrates efficient in-browser inference, gradient-based saliency analysis, and a seamless user experience, ensuring that AI detection is both transparent and interpretable. We also evaluate DejAIvu across multiple pretrained architectures and benchmark datasets, demonstrating high accuracy and low latency, making it a practical and deployable tool for enhancing AI image accountability. The code for this system can be found at https://github.com/Noodulz/dejAIvu.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{CSMAE~}$:~Cataract Surgical Masked Autoencoder (MAE) based Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated analysis of surgical videos is crucial for improving surgical training, workflow optimization, and postoperative assessment. We introduce a CSMAE, Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-based pretraining approach, specifically developed for Cataract Surgery video analysis, where instead of randomly selecting tokens for masking, they are selected based on the spatiotemporal importance of the token. We created a large dataset of cataract surgery videos to improve the model's learning efficiency and expand its robustness in low-data regimes. Our pre-trained model can be easily adapted for specific downstream tasks via fine-tuning, serving as a robust backbone for further analysis. Through rigorous testing on a downstream step-recognition task on two Cataract Surgery video datasets, D99 and Cataract-101, our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art self-supervised pretraining and adapter-based transfer learning methods by a significant margin. This advancement not only demonstrates the potential of our MAE-based pretraining in the field of surgical video analysis but also sets a new benchmark for future research.</description>

      <title>Survey on Single-Image Reflection Removal using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of reflection is quite common in digital images, posing significant challenges for various applications such as computer vision, photography, and image processing. Traditional methods for reflection removal often struggle to achieve clean results while maintaining high fidelity and robustness, particularly in real-world scenarios. Over the past few decades, numerous deep learning-based approaches for reflection removal have emerged, yielding impressive results. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the current literature by focusing on key venues such as ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, NeurIPS, etc., as these conferences and journals have been central to advances in the field. Our review follows a structured paper selection process, and we critically assess both single-stage and two-stage deep learning methods for reflection removal. The contribution of this survey is three-fold: first, we provide a comprehensive summary of the most recent work on single-image reflection removal; second, we outline task hypotheses, current deep learning techniques, publicly available datasets, and relevant evaluation metrics; and third, we identify key challenges and opportunities in deep learning-based reflection removal, highlighting the potential of this rapidly evolving research area.</description>

      <title>ShapeLib: designing a library of procedural 3D shape abstractions with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural representations are desirable, versatile, and popular shape encodings. Authoring them, either manually or using data-driven procedures, remains challenging, as a well-designed procedural representation should be compact, intuitive, and easy to manipulate. A long-standing problem in shape analysis studies how to discover a reusable library of procedural functions, with semantically aligned exposed parameters, that can explain an entire shape family. We present ShapeLib as the first method that leverages the priors of frontier LLMs to design a library of 3D shape abstraction functions. Our system accepts two forms of design intent: text descriptions of functions to include in the library and a seed set of exemplar shapes. We discover procedural abstractions that match this design intent by proposing, and then validating, function applications and implementations. The discovered shape functions in the library are not only expressive but also generalize beyond the seed set to a full family of shapes. We train a recognition network that learns to infer shape programs based on our library from different visual modalities (primitives, voxels, point clouds). Our shape functions have parameters that are semantically interpretable and can be modified to produce plausible shape variations. We show that this allows inferred programs to be successfully manipulated by an LLM given a text prompt. We evaluate ShapeLib on different datasets and show clear advantages over existing methods and alternative formulations.</description>

      <title>CoL3D: Collaborative Learning of Single-view Depth and Camera Intrinsics for Metric 3D Shape Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering the metric 3D shape from a single image is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied intelligence applications, where accurate spatial understanding is crucial for navigation and interaction with environments. Usually, the mainstream approaches achieve it through monocular depth estimation. However, without camera intrinsics, the 3D metric shape can not be recovered from depth alone. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that depth serves as a 3D prior constraint for estimating camera intrinsics and uncover the reciprocal relations between these two elements. Motivated by this, we propose a collaborative learning framework for jointly estimating depth and camera intrinsics, named CoL3D, to learn metric 3D shapes from single images. Specifically, CoL3D adopts a unified network and performs collaborative optimization at three levels: depth, camera intrinsics, and 3D point clouds. For camera intrinsics, we design a canonical incidence field mechanism as a prior that enables the model to learn the residual incident field for enhanced calibration. Additionally, we incorporate a shape similarity measurement loss in the point cloud space, which improves the quality of 3D shapes essential for robotic applications. As a result, when training and testing on a single dataset with in-domain settings, CoL3D delivers outstanding performance in both depth estimation and camera calibration across several indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets, which leads to remarkable 3D shape quality for the perception capabilities of robots.</description>

      <title>DiffoRA: Enabling Parameter-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning via Differential Low-Rank Matrix Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively researched for large language models in the downstream tasks. Among all the existing approaches, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for its streamlined design by incorporating low-rank matrices into existing pre-trained models. Though effective, LoRA allocates every module an identical low-rank matrix, which ignores the varying properties and contributions across different components. Moreover, the existing adaptive LoRA solutions rely highly on intuitive importance scoring indicators to adjust the interior rank of the decomposition matrices. In this paper, we propose a new PEFT scheme called DiffoRA, which is theoretically grounded and enables module-wise adoption of LoRA. At the core of our DiffoRA lies a Differential Adaptation Matrix (DAM) to determine which module is the most suitable and essential for fine-tuning. We explain how the designed matrix impacts the convergence rate and generalization capability of a pre-trained model. Furthermore, we construct the DAM via continuous relaxation and discretization with weight-sharing optimizations. We fully implement our DiffoRA and design comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best model accuracy over all the state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Through a Global Lens: Are They Culturally Inclusive?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have recently enabled the creation of visually compelling, detailed images from textual prompts. However, their ability to accurately represent various cultural nuances remains an open question. In our work, we introduce CultDiff benchmark, evaluating state-of-the-art diffusion models whether they can generate culturally specific images spanning ten countries. We show that these models often fail to generate cultural artifacts in architecture, clothing, and food, especially for underrepresented country regions, by conducting a fine-grained analysis of different similarity aspects, revealing significant disparities in cultural relevance, description fidelity, and realism compared to real-world reference images. With the collected human evaluations, we develop a neural-based image-image similarity metric, namely, CultDiff-S, to predict human judgment on real and generated images with cultural artifacts. Our work highlights the need for more inclusive generative AI systems and equitable dataset representation over a wide range of cultures.</description>

      <title>PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing diseases through histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is fundamental in modern pathology but is challenged by the gigapixel scale and complexity of WSIs. Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

      <title>Dynamic watermarks in images generated by diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but their widespread use raises significant ethical concerns, including intellectual property protection and the misuse of synthetic media. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-stage watermarking framework for diffusion models, designed to establish copyright and trace generated images back to their source. Our multi-stage watermarking technique involves embedding: (i) a fixed watermark that is localized in the diffusion model's learned noise distribution and, (ii) a human-imperceptible, dynamic watermark in generates images, leveraging a fine-tuned decoder. By leveraging the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and cosine similarity, we adapt the watermark's shape and color to the generated content while maintaining robustness. We demonstrate that our method enables reliable source verification through watermark classification, even when the dynamic watermark is adjusted for content-specific variations. Source model verification is enabled through watermark classification. o support further research, we generate a dataset of watermarked images and introduce a methodology to evaluate the statistical impact of watermarking on generated content.Additionally, we rigorously test our framework against various attack scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and minimal impact on image quality. Our work advances the field of AI-generated content security by providing a scalable solution for model ownership verification and misuse prevention.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Why Data Augmentation Improves Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is a cornerstone technique in deep learning, widely used to improve model generalization. Traditional methods like random cropping and color jittering, as well as advanced techniques such as CutOut, Mixup, and CutMix, have achieved notable success across various domains. However, the mechanisms by which data augmentation improves generalization remain poorly understood, and existing theoretical analyses typically focus on individual techniques without a unified explanation. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that elucidates how data augmentation enhances generalization through two key effects: partial semantic feature removal and feature mixing. Partial semantic feature removal reduces the model's reliance on individual feature, promoting diverse feature learning and better generalization. Feature mixing, by scaling down original semantic features and introducing noise, increases training complexity, driving the model to develop more robust features. Advanced methods like CutMix integrate both effects, achieving complementary benefits. Our theoretical insights are further supported by experimental results, validating the effectiveness of this unified perspective.</description>

      <title>Topo2Seq: Enhanced Topology Reasoning via Topology Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting lane topology from perspective views (PV) is crucial for planning and control in autonomous driving. This approach extracts potential drivable trajectories for self-driving vehicles without relying on high-definition (HD) maps. However, the unordered nature and weak long-range perception of the DETR-like framework can result in misaligned segment endpoints and limited topological prediction capabilities. Inspired by the learning of contextual relationships in language models, the connectivity relations in roads can be characterized as explicit topology sequences. In this paper, we introduce Topo2Seq, a novel approach for enhancing topology reasoning via topology sequences learning. The core concept of Topo2Seq is a randomized order prompt-to-sequence learning between lane segment decoder and topology sequence decoder. The dual-decoder branches simultaneously learn the lane topology sequences extracted from the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and the lane graph containing geometric information. Randomized order prompt-to-sequence learning extracts unordered key points from the lane graph predicted by the lane segment decoder, which are then fed into the prompt design of the topology sequence decoder to reconstruct an ordered and complete lane graph. In this way, the lane segment decoder learns powerful long-range perception and accurate topological reasoning from the topology sequence decoder. Notably, topology sequence decoder is only introduced during training and does not affect the inference efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Topo2Seq in topology reasoning.</description>

      <title>Text-driven 3D Human Generation via Contrastive Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have improved 3D human generation from textual descriptions. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately aligning 3D models with long and complex textual inputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that introduces contrastive preferences, where human-level preference models, guided by both positive and negative prompts, assist SDS for improved alignment. Specifically, we design a preference optimization module that integrates multiple models to comprehensively capture the full range of textual features. Furthermore, we introduce a negation preference module to mitigate over-optimization of irrelevant details by leveraging static-dynamic negation prompts, effectively preventing ``reward hacking". Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly enhancing texture realism and visual alignment with textual descriptions, particularly for long and complex inputs.</description>

      <title>Latents of latents to delineate pixels: hybrid Matryoshka autoencoder-to-U-Net pairing for segmenting large medical images in GPU-poor and low-data regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical images are often high-resolution and lose important detail if downsampled, making pixel-level methods such as semantic segmentation much less efficient if performed on a low-dimensional image. We propose a low-rank Matryoshka projection and a hybrid segmenting architecture that preserves important information while retaining sufficient pixel geometry for pixel-level tasks. We design the Matryoshka Autoencoder (MatAE-U-Net) which combines the hierarchical encoding of the Matryoshka Autoencoder with the spatial reconstruction capabilities of a U-Net decoder, leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and skip connections to enhance accuracy and generalisation. We apply it to the problem of segmenting the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiographic images using the Stanford EchoNet-D dataset, including 1,000 standardised video-mask pairs of cardiac ultrasound videos resized to 112x112 pixels. The MatAE-UNet model achieves a Mean IoU of 77.68\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.46\%, and Dice Coefficient of 86.91\%, outperforming the baseline U-Net, which attains a Mean IoU of 74.70\%, Mean Pixel Accuracy of 97.31\%, and Dice Coefficient of 85.20\%. The results highlight the potential of using the U-Net in the recursive Matroshka latent space for imaging problems with low-contrast such as echocardiographic analysis.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Prototypes for Interpretable Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainability is a highly demanded requirement for applications in high-risk areas such as medicine. Vision Transformers have mainly been limited to attention extraction to provide insight into the model's reasoning. Our approach combines the high performance of Vision Transformers with the introduction of new explainability capabilities. We present HierViT, a Vision Transformer that is inherently interpretable and adapts its reasoning to that of humans. A hierarchical structure is used to process domain-specific features for prediction. It is interpretable by design, as it derives the target output with human-defined features that are visualized by exemplary images (prototypes). By incorporating domain knowledge about these decisive features, the reasoning is semantically similar to human reasoning and therefore intuitive. Moreover, attention heatmaps visualize the crucial regions for identifying each feature, thereby providing HierViT with a versatile tool for validating predictions. Evaluated on two medical benchmark datasets, LIDC-IDRI for lung nodule assessment and derm7pt for skin lesion classification, HierViT achieves superior and comparable prediction accuracy, respectively, while offering explanations that align with human reasoning.</description>

      <title>Residual Transformer Fusion Network for Salt and Pepper Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used in unstructured datasets, one of which is image denoising. Image denoising is a noisy image reconstruction process that aims to reduce additional noise that occurs from the noisy image with various strategies. Image denoising has a problem, namely that some image denoising methods require some prior knowledge of information about noise. To overcome this problem, a combined architecture of Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) and Residual Networks (ResNet) is used which is called the Residual Transformer Fusion Network (RTF-Net). In general, the process in this architecture can be divided into two parts, Noise Suppression Network (NSN) and Structure Enhancement Network (SEN). Residual Block is used in the Noise Suppression Network and is used to learn the noise map in the image, while the CvT is used in the Structure Enhancement Network and is used to learn the details that need to be added to the image processed by the Noise Suppression Network. The model was trained using the DIV2K Training Set dataset, and validation using the DIV2K Validation Set. After doing the training, the model was tested using Lena, Bridge, Pepper, and BSD300 images with noise levels ranging from 30%, 50%, and 70% and the PSNR results were compared with the DBA, NASNLM, PARIGI, NLSF, NLSF-MLP and NLSF-CNN methods. The test results show that the proposed method is superior in all cases except for Pepper's image with a noise level of 30%, where NLSF-CNN is superior with a PSNR value of 32.99 dB, while the proposed method gets a PSNR value of 31.70 dB.</description>

      <title>EventSTR: A Benchmark Dataset and Baselines for Event Stream based Scene Text Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mainstream Scene Text Recognition (STR) algorithms are developed based on RGB cameras which are sensitive to challenging factors such as low illumination, motion blur, and cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, we propose to recognize the scene text using bio-inspired event cameras by collecting and annotating a large-scale benchmark dataset, termed EventSTR. It contains 9,928 high-definition (1280 * 720) event samples and involves both Chinese and English characters. We also benchmark multiple STR algorithms as the baselines for future works to compare. In addition, we propose a new event-based scene text recognition framework, termed SimC-ESTR. It first extracts the event features using a visual encoder and projects them into tokens using a Q-former module. More importantly, we propose to augment the vision tokens based on a memory mechanism before feeding into the large language models. A similarity-based error correction mechanism is embedded within the large language model to correct potential minor errors fundamentally based on contextual information. Extensive experiments on the newly proposed EventSTR dataset and two simulation STR datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We believe that the dataset and algorithmic model can innovatively propose an event-based STR task and are expected to accelerate the application of event cameras in various industries. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EventSTR</description>

      <title>Billet Number Recognition Based on Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the steel billet production process, it is essential to recognize machine-printed or manually written billet numbers on moving billets in real-time. To address the issue of low recognition accuracy for existing scene text recognition methods, caused by factors such as image distortions and distribution differences between training and test data, we propose a billet number recognition method that integrates test-time adaptation with prior knowledge. First, we introduce a test-time adaptation method into a model that uses the DB network for text detection and the SVTR network for text recognition. By minimizing the model's entropy during the testing phase, the model can adapt to the distribution of test data without the need for supervised fine-tuning. Second, we leverage the billet number encoding rules as prior knowledge to assess the validity of each recognition result. Invalid results, which do not comply with the encoding rules, are replaced. Finally, we introduce a validation mechanism into the CTC algorithm using prior knowledge to address its limitations in recognizing damaged characters. Experimental results on real datasets, including both machine-printed billet numbers and handwritten billet numbers, show significant improvements in evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Large Images are Gaussians: High-Quality Large Image Representation with Levels of 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have demonstrated significant success in image representation, they are often hindered by large training memory and slow decoding speed. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a promising solution in 3D reconstruction due to its high-quality novel view synthesis and rapid rendering capabilities, positioning it as a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of applications. In particular, a GS-based representation, 2DGS, has shown potential for image fitting. In our work, we present \textbf{L}arge \textbf{I}mages are \textbf{G}aussians (\textbf{LIG}), which delves deeper into the application of 2DGS for image representations, addressing the challenge of fitting large images with 2DGS in the situation of numerous Gaussian points, through two distinct modifications: 1) we adopt a variant of representation and optimization strategy, facilitating the fitting of a large number of Gaussian points; 2) we propose a Level-of-Gaussian approach for reconstructing both coarse low-frequency initialization and fine high-frequency details. Consequently, we successfully represent large images as Gaussian points and achieve high-quality large image representation, demonstrating its efficacy across various types of large images.

      <title>Evolution of Data-driven Single- and Multi-Hazard Susceptibility Mapping and Emergence of Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven susceptibility mapping of natural hazards has harnessed the advances in classification methods used on heterogeneous sources represented as raster images. Susceptibility mapping is an important step towards risk assessment for any natural hazard. Increasingly, multiple hazards co-occur spatially, temporally, or both, which calls for an in-depth study on multi-hazard susceptibility mapping. In recent years, single-hazard susceptibility mapping algorithms have become well-established and have been extended to multi-hazard susceptibility mapping. Deep learning is also emerging as a promising method for single-hazard susceptibility mapping. Here, we discuss the evolution of methods for a single hazard, their extensions to multi-hazard maps as a late fusion of decisions, and the use of deep learning methods in susceptibility mapping. We finally propose a vision for adapting data fusion strategies in multimodal deep learning to multi-hazard susceptibility mapping. From the background study of susceptibility methods, we demonstrate that deep learning models are promising, untapped methods for multi-hazard susceptibility mapping. Data fusion strategies provide a larger space of deep learning models applicable to multi-hazard susceptibility mapping.</description>

      <title>AIDE: Agentically Improve Visual Language Model with Domain Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement of Visual Language Models (VLMs) has traditionally relied on knowledge distillation from larger, more capable models. This dependence creates a fundamental bottleneck for improving state-of-the-art systems, particularly when no superior models exist. We introduce AIDE (Agentic Improvement through Domain Experts), a novel framework that enables VLMs to autonomously enhance their capabilities by leveraging specialized domain expert models. AIDE operates through a four-stage process: (1) identifying instances for refinement, (2) engaging domain experts for targeted analysis, (3) synthesizing expert outputs with existing data, and (4) integrating enhanced instances into the training pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MMMU, MME, MMBench, etc., demonstrate AIDE's ability to achieve notable performance gains without relying on larger VLMs nor human supervision. Our framework provides a scalable, resource-efficient approach to continuous VLM improvement, addressing critical limitations in current methodologies, particularly valuable when larger models are unavailable to access.</description>

      <title>Vision-Language In-Context Learning Driven Few-Shot Visual Inspection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose general visual inspection model using Vision-Language Model~(VLM) with few-shot images of non-defective or defective products, along with explanatory texts that serve as inspection criteria. Although existing VLM exhibit high performance across various tasks, they are not trained on specific tasks such as visual inspection. Thus, we construct a dataset consisting of diverse images of non-defective and defective products collected from the web, along with unified formatted output text, and fine-tune VLM. For new products, our method employs In-Context Learning, which allows the model to perform inspections with an example of non-defective or defective image and the corresponding explanatory texts with visual prompts. This approach eliminates the need to collect a large number of training samples and re-train the model for each product. The experimental results show that our method achieves high performance, with MCC of 0.804 and F1-score of 0.950 on MVTec AD in a one-shot manner.

      <title>StyleBlend: Enhancing Style-Specific Content Creation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing visually impressive images that seamlessly align both text prompts and specific artistic styles remains a significant challenge in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. This paper introduces StyleBlend, a method designed to learn and apply style representations from a limited set of reference images, enabling content synthesis of both text-aligned and stylistically coherent. Our approach uniquely decomposes style into two components, composition and texture, each learned through different strategies. We then leverage two synthesis branches, each focusing on a corresponding style component, to facilitate effective style blending through shared features without affecting content generation. StyleBlend addresses the common issues of text misalignment and weak style representation that previous methods have struggled with. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our approach.</description>

      <title>PTZ-Calib: Robust Pan-Tilt-Zoom Camera Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present PTZ-Calib, a robust two-stage PTZ camera calibration method, that efficiently and accurately estimates camera parameters for arbitrary viewpoints. Our method includes an offline and an online stage. In the offline stage, we first uniformly select a set of reference images that sufficiently overlap to encompass a complete 360{\deg} view. We then utilize the novel PTZ-IBA (PTZ Incremental Bundle Adjustment) algorithm to automatically calibrate the cameras within a local coordinate system. Additionally, for practical application, we can further optimize camera parameters and align them with the geographic coordinate system using extra global reference 3D information. In the online stage, we formulate the calibration of any new viewpoints as a relocalization problem. Our approach balances the accuracy and computational efficiency to meet real-world demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our robustness and superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on various real and synthetic datasets.

      <title>BevSplat: Resolving Height Ambiguity via Feature-Based Gaussian Primitives for Weakly-Supervised Cross-View Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of weakly supervised cross-view localization, where the goal is to estimate the pose of a ground camera relative to a satellite image with noisy ground truth annotations. A common approach to bridge the cross-view domain gap for pose estimation is Bird's-Eye View (BEV) synthesis. However, existing methods struggle with height ambiguity due to the lack of depth information in ground images and satellite height maps. Previous solutions either assume a flat ground plane or rely on complex models, such as cross-view transformers. We propose BevSplat, a novel method that resolves height ambiguity by using feature-based Gaussian primitives. Each pixel in the ground image is represented by a 3D Gaussian with semantic and spatial features, which are synthesized into a BEV feature map for relative pose estimation. Additionally, to address challenges with panoramic query images, we introduce an icosphere-based supervision strategy for the Gaussian primitives. We validate our method on the widely used KITTI and VIGOR datasets, which include both pinhole and panoramic query images. Experimental results show that BevSplat significantly improves localization accuracy over prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Implicit Shape representations for Sarcopenia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive loss of muscle mass and strength that significantly impacts daily life. A commonly studied criterion for characterizing the muscle mass has been the combination of 3D imaging and manual segmentations. In this paper, we instead study the muscles' shape. We rely on an implicit neural representation (INR) to model normal muscle shapes. We then introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection method to identify sarcopenic muscles based on the reconstruction error of the implicit model. Relying on a conditional INR with an auto-decoding strategy, we also learn a latent representation of the muscles that clearly separates normal from abnormal muscles in an unsupervised fashion. Experimental results on a dataset of 103 segmented volumes indicate that our double anomaly detection strategy effectively discriminates sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic muscles.</description>

      <title>From Visuals to Vocabulary: Establishing Equivalence Between Image and Text Token Through Autoregressive Pre-training in MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While MLLMs perform well on perceptual tasks, they lack precise multimodal alignment, limiting performance. To address this challenge, we propose Vision Dynamic Embedding-Guided Pretraining (VDEP), a hybrid autoregressive training paradigm for MLLMs. Utilizing dynamic embeddings from the MLP following the visual encoder, this approach supervises image hidden states and integrates image tokens into autoregressive training. Existing MLLMs primarily focused on recovering information from textual inputs, often neglecting the effective processing of image data. In contrast, the key improvement of this work is the reinterpretation of multimodal alignment as a process of recovering information from input data, with particular emphasis on reconstructing detailed visual features.The proposed method seamlessly integrates into standard models without architectural changes. Experiments on 13 benchmarks show VDEP outperforms baselines, surpassing existing methods.</description>

      <title>Pulling Back the Curtain: Unsupervised Adversarial Detection via Contrastive Auxiliary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are widely employed in safety-critical applications yet remain susceptible to adversarial attacks -- imperceptible perturbations that can significantly degrade model performance. Conventional defense mechanisms predominantly focus on either enhancing model robustness or detecting adversarial inputs independently. In this work, we propose an Unsupervised adversarial detection via Contrastive Auxiliary Networks (U-CAN) to uncover adversarial behavior within auxiliary feature representations, without the need for adversarial examples. U-CAN is embedded within selected intermediate layers of the target model. These auxiliary networks, comprising projection layers and ArcFace-based linear layers, refine feature representations to more effectively distinguish between benign and adversarial inputs. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, Mammals, and a subset of ImageNet) and architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT) demonstrate that our method surpasses existing unsupervised adversarial detection techniques, achieving superior F1 scores against four distinct attack methods. The proposed framework provides a scalable and effective solution for enhancing the security and reliability of deep learning systems.</description>

      <title>DenseSplat: Densifying Gaussian Splatting SLAM with Neural Radiance Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian SLAM systems excel in real-time rendering and fine-grained reconstruction compared to NeRF-based systems. However, their reliance on extensive keyframes is impractical for deployment in real-world robotic systems, which typically operate under sparse-view conditions that can result in substantial holes in the map. To address these challenges, we introduce DenseSplat, the first SLAM system that effectively combines the advantages of NeRF and 3DGS. DenseSplat utilizes sparse keyframes and NeRF priors for initializing primitives that densely populate maps and seamlessly fill gaps. It also implements geometry-aware primitive sampling and pruning strategies to manage granularity and enhance rendering efficiency. Moreover, DenseSplat integrates loop closure and bundle adjustment, significantly enhancing frame-to-frame tracking accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale datasets demonstrate that DenseSplat achieves superior performance in tracking and mapping compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Automatic Pruning via Structured Lasso with Class-wise Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most pruning methods concentrate on unimportant filters of neural networks. However, they face the loss of statistical information due to a lack of consideration for class-wise data. In this paper, from the perspective of leveraging precise class-wise information for model pruning, we utilize structured lasso with guidance from Information Bottleneck theory. Our approach ensures that statistical information is retained during the pruning process. With these techniques, we introduce two innovative adaptive network pruning schemes: sparse graph-structured lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (\textbf{sGLP-IB}) and sparse tree-guided lasso pruning with Information Bottleneck (\textbf{sTLP-IB}). The key aspect is pruning model filters using sGLP-IB and sTLP-IB to better capture class-wise relatedness. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods, our approaches demonstrate superior performance across three datasets and six model architectures in extensive experiments. For instance, using the VGG16 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we achieve a parameter reduction of 85%, a decrease in FLOPs by 61%, and maintain an accuracy of 94.10% (0.14% higher than the original model); we reduce the parameters by 55% with the accuracy at 76.12% using the ResNet architecture on ImageNet (only drops 0.03%). In summary, we successfully reduce model size and computational resource usage while maintaining accuracy. Our codes are at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IJCAI-8104.</description>

      <title>Feature-based Graph Attention Networks Improve Online Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online continual learning for image classification is crucial for models to adapt to new data while retaining knowledge of previously learned tasks. This capability is essential to address real-world challenges involving dynamic environments and evolving data distributions. Traditional approaches predominantly employ Convolutional Neural Networks, which are limited to processing images as grids and primarily capture local patterns rather than relational information. Although the emergence of transformer architectures has improved the ability to capture relationships, these models often require significantly larger resources. In this paper, we present a novel online continual learning framework based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which effectively capture contextual relationships and dynamically update the task-specific representation via learned attention weights. Our approach utilizes a pre-trained feature extractor to convert images into graphs using hierarchical feature maps, representing information at varying levels of granularity. These graphs are then processed by a GAT and incorporate an enhanced global pooling strategy to improve classification performance for continual learning. In addition, we propose the rehearsal memory duplication technique that improves the representation of the previous tasks while maintaining the memory budget. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and MiniImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Multimodal HIE Lesion Segmentation in Neonates: A Comparative Study of Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) lesions in neonatal MRI is a crucial but challenging task due to diffuse multifocal lesions with varying volumes and the limited availability of annotated HIE lesion datasets. Using the BONBID-HIE dataset, we implemented a 3D U-Net with optimized preprocessing, augmentation, and training strategies to overcome data constraints. The goal of this study is to identify the optimal loss function specifically for the HIE lesion segmentation task. To this end, we evaluated various loss functions, including Dice, Dice-Focal, Tversky, Hausdorff Distance (HausdorffDT) Loss, and two proposed compound losses -- Dice-Focal-HausdorffDT and Tversky-HausdorffDT -- to enhance segmentation performance. The results show that different loss functions predict distinct segmentation masks, with compound losses outperforming standalone losses. Tversky-HausdorffDT Loss achieves the highest Dice and Normalized Surface Dice scores, while Dice-Focal-HausdorffDT Loss minimizes Mean Surface Distance. This work underscores the significance of task-specific loss function optimization, demonstrating that combining region-based and boundary-aware losses leads to more accurate HIE lesion segmentation, even with limited training data.</description>

      <title>E-MD3C: Taming Masked Diffusion Transformers for Efficient Zero-Shot Object Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose E-MD3C ($\underline{E}$fficient $\underline{M}$asked $\underline{D}$iffusion Transformer with Disentangled $\underline{C}$onditions and $\underline{C}$ompact $\underline{C}$ollector), a highly efficient framework for zero-shot object image customization. Unlike prior works reliant on resource-intensive Unet architectures, our approach employs lightweight masked diffusion transformers operating on latent patches, offering significantly improved computational efficiency. The framework integrates three core components: (1) an efficient masked diffusion transformer for processing autoencoder latents, (2) a disentangled condition design that ensures compactness while preserving background alignment and fine details, and (3) a learnable Conditions Collector that consolidates multiple inputs into a compact representation for efficient denoising and learning. E-MD3C outperforms the existing approach on the VITON-HD dataset across metrics such as PSNR, FID, SSIM, and LPIPS, demonstrating clear advantages in parameters, memory efficiency, and inference speed. With only $\frac{1}{4}$ of the parameters, our Transformer-based 468M model delivers $2.5\times$ faster inference and uses $\frac{2}{3}$ of the GPU memory compared to an 1720M Unet-based latent diffusion model.</description>

Abstract: The detection of shot boundaries (hardcuts and short dissolves), sampling structure (progressive / interlaced / pulldown) and dynamic keyframes in a video are fundamental video analysis tasks which have to be done before any further high-level analysis tasks. We present a novel algorithm which does all these analysis tasks in an unified way, by utilizing a combination of inter-frame and intra-frame measures derived from the motion field and normalized cross correlation. The algorithm runs four times faster than real-time due to sparse and selective calculation of these measures. An initial evaluation furthermore shows that the proposed algorithm is extremely robust even for challenging content showing large camera or object motion, flashlights, flicker or low contrast / noise.</description>

      <title>DynSegNet:Dynamic Architecture Adjustment for Adversarial Learning in Segmenting Hemorrhagic Lesions from Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hemorrhagic lesion segmentation plays a critical role in ophthalmic diagnosis, directly influencing early disease detection, treatment planning, and therapeutic efficacy evaluation. However, the task faces significant challenges due to lesion morphological variability, indistinct boundaries, and low contrast with background tissues. To improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes, developing advanced segmentation techniques remains imperative. This paper proposes an adversarial learning-based dynamic architecture adjustment approach that integrates hierarchical U-shaped encoder-decoder, residual blocks, attention mechanisms, and ASPP modules. By dynamically optimizing feature fusion, our method enhances segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate a Dice coefficient of 0.6802, IoU of 0.5602, Recall of 0.766, Precision of 0.6525, and Accuracy of 0.9955, effectively addressing the challenges in fundus image hemorrhage segmentation.[* Corresponding author.]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing models typically segment either the entire 3D frame or 2D slices independently to derive clinical functional metrics from ventricular segmentation in cardiac cine sequences. While performing well overall, they struggle at the end slices. To address this, we leverage spatial continuity to extract global uncertainty from segmentation variance and use it as memory in our ensemble learning method, Streaming, for classifier weighting, balancing overall and end-slice performance. Additionally, we introduce the End Coefficient (EC) to quantify end-slice accuracy. Experiments on ACDC and M\&amp;Ms datasets show that our framework achieves near-state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and outperforms all models on end-slice performance, improving patient-specific segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>FLARES: Fast and Accurate LiDAR Multi-Range Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D scene understanding is a critical yet challenging task in autonomous driving, primarily due to the irregularity and sparsity of LiDAR data, as well as the computational demands of processing large-scale point clouds. Recent methods leverage the range-view representation to improve processing efficiency. To mitigate the performance drop caused by information loss inherent to the "many-to-one" problem, where multiple nearby 3D points are mapped to the same 2D grids and only the closest is retained, prior works tend to choose a higher azimuth resolution for range-view projection. However, this can bring the drawback of reducing the proportion of pixels that carry information and heavier computation within the network. We argue that it is not the optimal solution and show that, in contrast, decreasing the resolution is more advantageous in both efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we present a comprehensive re-design of the workflow for range-view-based LiDAR semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses data representation, augmentation, and post-processing methods for improvements. Through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we demonstrate that our pipeline significantly enhances the performance of various network architectures over their baselines, paving the way for more effective LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>ConsistentDreamer: View-Consistent Meshes Through Balanced Multi-View Gaussian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved 3D generation, enabling the use of assets generated from an image for embodied AI simulations. However, the one-to-many nature of the image-to-3D problem limits their use due to inconsistent content and quality across views. Previous models optimize a 3D model by sampling views from a view-conditioned diffusion prior, but diffusion models cannot guarantee view consistency. Instead, we present ConsistentDreamer, where we first generate a set of fixed multi-view prior images and sample random views between them with another diffusion model through a score distillation sampling (SDS) loss. Thereby, we limit the discrepancies between the views guided by the SDS loss and ensure a consistent rough shape. In each iteration, we also use our generated multi-view prior images for fine-detail reconstruction. To balance between the rough shape and the fine-detail optimizations, we introduce dynamic task-dependent weights based on homoscedastic uncertainty, updated automatically in each iteration. Additionally, we employ opacity, depth distortion, and normal alignment losses to refine the surface for mesh extraction. Our method ensures better view consistency and visual quality compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>FE-LWS: Refined Image-Text Representations via Decoder Stacking and Fused Encodings for Remote Sensing Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing image captioning aims to generate descriptive text from remote sensing images, typically employing an encoder-decoder framework. In this setup, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts feature representations from the input image, which then guide the decoder in a sequence-to-sequence caption generation process. Although much research has focused on refining the decoder, the quality of image representations from the encoder remains crucial for accurate captioning. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates features from two distinct CNN based encoders, capturing complementary information to enhance caption generation. Additionally, we propose a weighted averaging technique to combine the outputs of all GRUs in the stacked decoder. Furthermore, a comparison-based beam search strategy is incorporated to refine caption selection. The results demonstrate that our fusion-based approach, along with the enhanced stacked decoder, significantly outperforms both the transformer-based state-of-the-art model and other LSTM-based baselines.</description>

      <title>EmoAssist: Emotional Assistant for Visual Impairment Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large multi-modality models (LMMs) has significantly propelled the integration of artificial intelligence into practical applications. Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems, which can process multi-modal data including vision, text, and audio, hold great potential for assisting the Visual Impairment (VI) community in navigating complex and dynamic real-world environments. However, existing VI assistive LMMs overlook the emotional needs of VI individuals, and current benchmarks lack emotional evaluation of these LMMs. To address these gaps, this paper introduces the EmoAssist Benchmark, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the assistive performance of LMMs for the VI community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark that incorporates emotional intelligence as a key consideration. Furthermore, we propose the EmoAssist Model, an Emotion-Assistive LMM specifically designed for the VI community. The EmoAssist Model utilizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align outputs with human emotional preferences. Experiment results demonstrate that the EmoAssist Model significantly enhances the recognition of implicit emotions and intentions of VI users, delivers empathetic responses, and provides actionable guidance. Specifically, it shows respective improvements of 147.8% and 89.7% in the Empathy and Suggestion metrics on the EmoAssist Benchmark, compared to the pre-tuning LMM, and even outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Deep Learning Model for MRI Brain Motion Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: MRI is crucial for brain imaging but is highly susceptible to motion artifacts due to long acquisition times. This study introduces PI-MoCoNet, a physics-informed motion correction network that integrates spatial and k-space information to remove motion artifacts without explicit motion parameter estimation, enhancing image fidelity and diagnostic reliability. Materials and Methods: PI-MoCoNet consists of a motion detection network (U-net with spatial averaging) to identify corrupted k-space lines and a motion correction network (U-net with Swin Transformer blocks) to reconstruct motion-free images. The correction is guided by three loss functions: reconstruction (L1), perceptual (LPIPS), and data consistency (Ldc). Motion artifacts were simulated via rigid phase encoding perturbations and evaluated on IXI and MR-ART datasets against Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, and U-net using PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE. Results: PI-MoCoNet significantly improved image quality. On IXI, for minor artifacts, PSNR increased from 34.15 dB to 45.95 dB, SSIM from 0.87 to 1.00, and NMSE reduced from 0.55% to 0.04%. For moderate artifacts, PSNR improved from 30.23 dB to 42.16 dB, SSIM from 0.80 to 0.99, and NMSE from 1.32% to 0.09%. For heavy artifacts, PSNR rose from 27.99 dB to 36.01 dB, SSIM from 0.75 to 0.97, and NMSE decreased from 2.21% to 0.36%. On MR-ART, PI-MoCoNet achieved PSNR gains of ~10 dB and SSIM improvements of up to 0.20, with NMSE reductions of ~6%. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of data consistency and perceptual losses, yielding a 1 dB PSNR gain and 0.17% NMSE reduction. Conclusions: PI-MoCoNet effectively mitigates motion artifacts in brain MRI, outperforming existing methods. Its ability to integrate spatial and k-space information makes it a promising tool for clinical use in motion-prone settings. Code: https://github.com/mosaf/PI-MoCoNet.git.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the Impact of Prominent Position Shift in Drone-based RGBT Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drone-based RGBT object detection plays a crucial role in many around-the-clock applications. However, real-world drone-viewed RGBT data suffers from the prominent position shift problem, i.e., the position of a tiny object differs greatly in different modalities. For instance, a slight deviation of a tiny object in the thermal modality will induce it to drift from the main body of itself in the RGB modality. Considering RGBT data are usually labeled on one modality (reference), this will cause the unlabeled modality (sensed) to lack accurate supervision signals and prevent the detector from learning a good representation. Moreover, the mismatch of the corresponding feature point between the modalities will make the fused features confusing for the detection head. In this paper, we propose to cast the cross-modality box shift issue as the label noise problem and address it on the fly via a novel Mean Teacher-based Cross-modality Box Correction head ensemble (CBC). In this way, the network can learn more informative representations for both modalities. Furthermore, to alleviate the feature map mismatch problem in RGBT fusion, we devise a Shifted Window-Based Cascaded Alignment (SWCA) module. SWCA mines long-range dependencies between the spatially unaligned features inside shifted windows and cascaded aligns the sensed features with the reference ones. Extensive experiments on two drone-based RGBT object detection datasets demonstrate that the correction results are both visually and quantitatively favorable, thereby improving the detection performance. In particular, our CBC module boosts the precision of the sensed modality ground truth by 25.52 aSim points. Overall, the proposed detector achieves an mAP_50 of 43.55 points on RGBTDronePerson and surpasses a state-of-the-art method by 8.6 mAP50 on a shift subset of DroneVehicle dataset. The code and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for Crime Surveillance Video Analysis with Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis in surveillance videos is a crucial topic in computer vision. In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have outperformed task-specific models in various domains. Although MLLMs are particularly versatile, their abilities to understand anomalous concepts and details are insufficiently studied because of the outdated benchmarks of this field not providing MLLM-style QAs and efficient algorithms to assess the model's open-ended text responses. To fill this gap, we propose a benchmark for crime surveillance video analysis with large models denoted as UCVL, including 1,829 videos and reorganized annotations from the UCF-Crime and UCF-Crime Annotation datasets. We design six types of questions and generate diverse QA pairs. Then we develop detailed instructions and use OpenAI's GPT-4o for accurate assessment. We benchmark eight prevailing MLLMs ranging from 0.5B to 40B parameters, and the results demonstrate the reliability of this bench. Moreover, we finetune LLaVA-OneVision on UCVL's training set. The improvement validates our data's high quality for video anomaly analysis.</description>

      <title>Galileo: Learning Global and Local Features in Pretrained Remote Sensing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From crop mapping to flood detection, machine learning in remote sensing has a wide range of societally beneficial applications. The commonalities between remote sensing data in these applications present an opportunity for pretrained machine learning models tailored to remote sensing to reduce the labeled data and effort required to solve individual tasks. However, such models must be: (i) flexible enough to ingest input data of varying sensor modalities and shapes (i.e., of varying spatial and temporal dimensions), and (ii) able to model Earth surface phenomena of varying scales and types. To solve this gap, we present Galileo, a family of pretrained remote sensing models designed to flexibly process multimodal remote sensing data. We also introduce a novel and highly effective self-supervised learning approach to learn both large- and small-scale features, a challenge not addressed by previous models. Our Galileo models obtain state-of-the-art results across diverse remote sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>ImageRAG: Dynamic Image Retrieval for Reference-Guided Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality and diverse visual content synthesis. However, they struggle to generate rare or unseen concepts. To address this challenge, we explore the usage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with image generation models. We propose ImageRAG, a method that dynamically retrieves relevant images based on a given text prompt, and uses them as context to guide the generation process. Prior approaches that used retrieved images to improve generation, trained models specifically for retrieval-based generation. In contrast, ImageRAG leverages the capabilities of existing image conditioning models, and does not require RAG-specific training. Our approach is highly adaptable and can be applied across different model types, showing significant improvement in generating rare and fine-grained concepts using different base models.

      <title>A 3D Facial Reconstruction Evaluation Methodology: Comparing Smartphone Scans with Deep Learning Based Methods Using Geometry and Morphometry Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) facial shape analysis has gained interest due to its potential clinical applications. However, the high cost of advanced 3D facial acquisition systems limits their widespread use, driving the development of low-cost acquisition and reconstruction methods. This study introduces a novel evaluation methodology that goes beyond traditional geometry-based benchmarks by integrating morphometric shape analysis techniques, providing a statistical framework for assessing facial morphology preservation. As a case study, we compare smartphone-based 3D scans with state-of-the-art deep learning reconstruction methods from 2D images, using high-end stereophotogrammetry models as ground truth. This methodology enables a quantitative assessment of global and local shape differences, offering a biologically meaningful validation approach for low-cost 3D facial acquisition and reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Redistribute Ensemble Training for Mitigating Memorization in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, known for their tremendous ability to generate high-quality samples, have recently raised concerns due to their data memorization behavior, which poses privacy risks. Recent methods for memory mitigation have primarily addressed the issue within the context of the text modality in cross-modal generation tasks, restricting their applicability to specific conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for diffusion models from the perspective of visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating memorization. Directly exposing visual data to the model increases memorization risk, so we design a framework where models learn through proxy model parameters instead. Specially, the training dataset is divided into multiple shards, with each shard training a proxy model, then aggregated to form the final model. Additionally, practical analysis of training losses illustrates that the losses for easily memorable images tend to be obviously lower. Thus, we skip the samples with abnormally low loss values from the current mini-batch to avoid memorizing. However, balancing the need to skip memorization-prone samples while maintaining sufficient training data for high-quality image generation presents a key challenge. Thus, we propose IET-AGC+, which redistributes highly memorizable samples between shards, to mitigate these samples from over-skipping. Furthermore, we dynamically augment samples based on their loss values to further reduce memorization. Extensive experiments and analysis on four datasets show that our method successfully reduces memory capacity while maintaining performance. Moreover, we fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, and decrease the memorization score by 46.7\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Pixel-Level Reasoning Segmentation via Multi-turn Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing visual perception systems focus on region-level segmentation in single-turn dialogues, relying on complex and explicit query instructions. Such systems cannot reason at the pixel level and comprehend dynamic user intent that changes over interaction. Our work tackles this issue by introducing a novel task, Pixel-level Reasoning Segmentation (Pixel-level RS) based on multi-turn conversations, tracking evolving user intent via multi-turn interactions for fine-grained segmentation. To establish a benchmark for this novel task, we build a Pixel-level ReasonIng Segmentation Dataset Based on Multi-Turn Conversations (PRIST), comprising 24k utterances from 8.3k multi-turn conversational scenarios with segmentation targets. Building on PRIST, we further propose MIRAS, a Multi-turn Interactive ReAsoning Segmentation framework, integrates pixel-level segmentation with robust multi-turn conversation understanding, generating pixel-grounded explanations aligned with user intent. The PRIST dataset and MIRSA framework fill the gap in pixel-level reasoning segmentation. Experimental results on the PRIST dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current segmentation-specific baselines in terms of segmentation and LLM-based reasoning metrics.

      <title>Wholly-WOOD: Wholly Leveraging Diversified-quality Labels for Weakly-supervised Oriented Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating the orientation of visual objects with compact rotated bounding boxes (RBoxes) has become a prominent demand, which challenges existing object detection paradigms that only use horizontal bounding boxes (HBoxes). To equip the detectors with orientation awareness, supervised regression/classification modules have been introduced at the high cost of rotation annotation. Meanwhile, some existing datasets with oriented objects are already annotated with horizontal boxes or even single points. It becomes attractive yet remains open for effectively utilizing weaker single point and horizontal annotations to train an oriented object detector (OOD). We develop Wholly-WOOD, a weakly-supervised OOD framework, capable of wholly leveraging various labeling forms (Points, HBoxes, RBoxes, and their combination) in a unified fashion. By only using HBox for training, our Wholly-WOOD achieves performance very close to that of the RBox-trained counterpart on remote sensing and other areas, significantly reducing the tedious efforts on labor-intensive annotation for oriented objects. The source codes are available at https://github.com/VisionXLab/whollywood (PyTorch-based) and https://github.com/VisionXLab/whollywood-jittor (Jittor-based).</description>

      <title>Standardisation of Convex Ultrasound Data Through Geometric Analysis and Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of ultrasound in healthcare has seen increased diversity and importance. Unlike other medical imaging modalities, ultrasound research and development has historically lagged, particularly in the case of applications with data-driven algorithms. A significant issue with ultrasound is the extreme variability of the images, due to the number of different machines available and the possible combination of parameter settings. One outcome of this is the lack of standardised and benchmarking ultrasound datasets. The method proposed in this article is an approach to alleviating this issue of disorganisation. For this purpose, the issue of ultrasound data sparsity is examined and a novel perspective, approach, and solution is proposed; involving the extraction of the underlying ultrasound plane within the image and representing it using annulus sector geometry. An application of this methodology is proposed, which is the extraction of scan lines and the linearisation of convex planes. Validation of the robustness of the proposed method is performed on both private and public data. The impact of deformation and the invertibility of augmentation using the estimated annulus sector parameters is also studied. Keywords: Ultrasound, Annulus Sector, Augmentation, Linearisation.</description>

      <title>Prior-Constrained Association Learning for Fine-Grained Generalized Category Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses generalized category discovery (GCD), the task of clustering unlabeled data from potentially known or unknown categories with the help of labeled instances from each known category. Compared to traditional semi-supervised learning, GCD is more challenging because unlabeled data could be from novel categories not appearing in labeled data. Current state-of-the-art methods typically learn a parametric classifier assisted by self-distillation. While being effective, these methods do not make use of cross-instance similarity to discover class-specific semantics which are essential for representation learning and category discovery. In this paper, we revisit the association-based paradigm and propose a Prior-constrained Association Learning method to capture and learn the semantic relations within data. In particular, the labeled data from known categories provides a unique prior for the association of unlabeled data. Unlike previous methods that only adopts the prior as a pre or post-clustering refinement, we fully incorporate the prior into the association process, and let it constrain the association towards a reliable grouping outcome. The estimated semantic groups are utilized through non-parametric prototypical contrast to enhance the representation learning. A further combination of both parametric and non-parametric classification complements each other and leads to a model that outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. On multiple GCD benchmarks, we perform extensive experiments and validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>SQ-GAN: Semantic Image Communications Using Masked Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Semantically Masked VQ-GAN (SQ-GAN), a novel approach integrating generative models to optimize image compression for semantic/task-oriented communications. SQ-GAN employs off-the-shelf semantic semantic segmentation and a new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) to selectively encode semantically significant features of the images. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000 and BPG across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the post-decoding reconstructed image, at extreme low compression rates expressed in bits per pixel.</description>

      <title>SteROI-D: System Design and Mapping for Stereo Depth Inference on Regions of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have enabled high quality stereo depth estimation to run on Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices. However, high energy consumption across the full image processing stack prevents stereo depth algorithms from running effectively on battery-limited devices. This paper introduces SteROI-D, a full stereo depth system paired with a mapping methodology. SteROI-D exploits Region-of-Interest (ROI) and temporal sparsity at the system level to save energy. SteROI-D's flexible and heterogeneous compute fabric supports diverse ROIs. Importantly, we introduce a systematic mapping methodology to effectively handle dynamic ROIs, thereby maximizing energy savings. Using these techniques, our 28nm prototype SteROI-D design achieves up to 4.35x reduction in total system energy compared to a baseline ASIC.</description>

      <title>Long-Term TalkingFace Generation via Motion-Prior Conditional Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in conditional diffusion models have shown promise for generating realistic TalkingFace videos, yet challenges persist in achieving consistent head movement, synchronized facial expressions, and accurate lip synchronization over extended generations. To address these, we introduce the \textbf{M}otion-priors \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MCDM}), which utilizes both archived and current clip motion priors to enhance motion prediction and ensure temporal consistency. The model consists of three key elements: (1) an archived-clip motion-prior that incorporates historical frames and a reference frame to preserve identity and context; (2) a present-clip motion-prior diffusion model that captures multimodal causality for accurate predictions of head movements, lip sync, and expressions; and (3) a memory-efficient temporal attention mechanism that mitigates error accumulation by dynamically storing and updating motion features. We also release the \textbf{TalkingFace-Wild} dataset, a multilingual collection of over 200 hours of footage across 10 languages. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in maintaining identity and motion continuity for long-term TalkingFace generation. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrating Gaussian Splatting for Large Field of View Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a self-calibrating framework that jointly optimizes camera parameters, lens distortion and 3D Gaussian representations, enabling accurate and efficient scene reconstruction. In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we tackle industry challenges in video content classification by exploring and optimizing GPT-based models for zero-shot classification across seven critical categories of video quality. We contribute a novel approach to improving GPT's performance through prompt optimization and policy refinement, demonstrating that simplifying complex policies significantly reduces false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a new decomposition-aggregation-based prompt engineering technique, which outperforms traditional single-prompt methods. These experiments, conducted on real industry problems, show that thoughtful prompt design can substantially enhance GPT's performance without additional finetuning, offering an effective and scalable solution for improving video classification systems across various domains in industry.</description>

      <title>GAIA: A Global, Multi-modal, Multi-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous operation of Earth-orbiting satellites generates vast and ever-growing archives of Remote Sensing (RS) images. Natural language presents an intuitive interface for accessing, querying, and interpreting the data from such archives. However, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are predominantly trained on web-scraped, noisy image-text data, exhibiting limited exposure to the specialized domain of RS. This deficiency results in poor performance on RS-specific tasks, as commonly used datasets often lack detailed, scientifically accurate textual descriptions and instead emphasize solely on attributes like date and location. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce GAIA, a novel dataset designed for multi-scale, multi-sensor, and multi-modal RS image analysis. GAIA comprises of 205,150 meticulously curated RS image-text pairs, representing a diverse range of RS modalities associated to different spatial resolutions. Unlike existing vision-language datasets in RS, GAIA specifically focuses on capturing a diverse range of RS applications, providing unique information about environmental changes, natural disasters, and various other dynamic phenomena. The dataset provides a spatially and temporally balanced distribution, spanning across the globe, covering the last 25 years with a balanced temporal distribution of observations. GAIA's construction involved a two-stage process: (1) targeted web-scraping of images and accompanying text from reputable RS-related sources, and (2) generation of five high-quality, scientifically grounded synthetic captions for each image using carefully crafted prompts that leverage the advanced vision-language capabilities of GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments, including fine-tuning of CLIP and BLIP2 models, demonstrate that GAIA significantly improves performance on RS image classification, cross-modal retrieval and image captioning tasks.</description>

      <title>Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce SketchSeg, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach and will release it to promote further research in the field.

      <title>Latent Radiance Fields with 3D-aware 2D Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent 3D reconstruction has shown great promise in empowering 3D semantic understanding and 3D generation by distilling 2D features into the 3D space. However, existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between 2D feature space and 3D representations, resulting in degraded rendering performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates 3D awareness into the 2D latent space. The framework consists of three stages: (1) a correspondence-aware autoencoding method that enhances the 3D consistency of 2D latent representations, (2) a latent radiance field (LRF) that lifts these 3D-aware 2D representations into 3D space, and (3) a VAE-Radiance Field (VAE-RF) alignment strategy that improves image decoding from the rendered 2D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art latent 3D reconstruction approaches in terms of synthesis performance and cross-dataset generalizability across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing the radiance field representations constructed from 2D latent representations can yield photorealistic 3D reconstruction performance.</description>

      <title>RigAnything: Template-Free Autoregressive Rigging for Diverse 3D Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present RigAnything, a novel autoregressive transformer-based model, which makes 3D assets rig-ready by probabilistically generating joints, skeleton topologies, and assigning skinning weights in a template-free manner. Unlike most existing auto-rigging methods, which rely on predefined skeleton template and are limited to specific categories like humanoid, RigAnything approaches the rigging problem in an autoregressive manner, iteratively predicting the next joint based on the global input shape and the previous prediction. While autoregressive models are typically used to generate sequential data, RigAnything extends their application to effectively learn and represent skeletons, which are inherently tree structures. To achieve this, we organize the joints in a breadth-first search (BFS) order, enabling the skeleton to be defined as a sequence of 3D locations and the parent index. Furthermore, our model improves the accuracy of position prediction by leveraging diffusion modeling, ensuring precise and consistent placement of joints within the hierarchy. This formulation allows the autoregressive model to efficiently capture both spatial and hierarchical relationships within the skeleton. Trained end-to-end on both RigNet and Objaverse datasets, RigAnything demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse object types, including humanoids, quadrupeds, marine creatures, insects, and many more, surpassing prior methods in quality, robustness, generalizability, and efficiency.

      <title>LIFe-GoM: Generalizable Human Rendering with Learned Iterative Feedback Over Multi-Resolution Gaussians-on-Mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable rendering of an animatable human avatar from sparse inputs relies on data priors and inductive biases extracted from training on large data to avoid scene-specific optimization and to enable fast reconstruction. This raises two main challenges: First, unlike iterative gradient-based adjustment in scene-specific optimization, generalizable methods must reconstruct the human shape representation in a single pass at inference time. Second, rendering is preferably computationally efficient yet of high resolution. To address both challenges we augment the recently proposed dual shape representation, which combines the benefits of a mesh and Gaussian points, in two ways. To improve reconstruction, we propose an iterative feedback update framework, which successively improves the canonical human shape representation during reconstruction. To achieve computationally efficient yet high-resolution rendering, we study a coupled-multi-resolution Gaussians-on-Mesh representation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging THuman2.0, XHuman and AIST++ data. Our approach reconstructs an animatable representation from sparse inputs in less than 1s, renders views with 95.1FPS at $1024 \times 1024$, and achieves PSNR/LPIPS*/FID of 24.65/110.82/51.27 on THuman2.0, outperforming the state-of-the-art in rendering quality.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Encoder-free Architectures in 3D LMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoder-free architectures have been preliminarily explored in the 2D visual domain, yet it remains an open question whether they can be effectively applied to 3D understanding scenarios. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the potential of encoder-free architectures to overcome the challenges of encoder-based 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). These challenges include the failure to adapt to varying point cloud resolutions and the point features from the encoder not meeting the semantic needs of Large Language Models (LLMs). We identify key aspects for 3D LMMs to remove the encoder and enable the LLM to assume the role of the 3D encoder: 1) We propose the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding strategy in the pre-training stage, exploring the effects of various point cloud self-supervised losses. And we present the Hybrid Semantic Loss to extract high-level semantics. 2) We introduce the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation strategy in the instruction tuning stage. This incorporates inductive bias into the LLM early layers to focus on the local details of the point clouds. To the end, we present the first Encoder-free 3D LMM, ENEL. Our 7B model rivals the current state-of-the-art model, ShapeLLM-13B, achieving 55.0%, 50.92%, and 42.7% on the classification, captioning, and VQA tasks, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the encoder-free architecture is highly promising for replacing encoder-based architectures in the field of 3D understanding.

      <title>MME-CoT: Benchmarking Chain-of-Thought in Large Multimodal Models for Reasoning Quality, Robustness, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering questions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) still lacks a systematic assessment and in-depth investigation. In this paper, we introduce MME-CoT, a specialized benchmark evaluating the CoT reasoning performance of LMMs, spanning six domains: math, science, OCR, logic, space-time, and general scenes. As the first comprehensive study in this area, we propose a thorough evaluation suite incorporating three novel metrics that assess the reasoning quality, robustness, and efficiency at a fine-grained level. Leveraging curated high-quality data and a unique evaluation strategy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art LMMs, uncovering several key insights: 1) Models with reflection mechanism demonstrate a superior CoT quality, with Kimi k1.5 outperforming GPT-4o and demonstrating the highest quality results; 2) CoT prompting often degrades LMM performance on perception-heavy tasks, suggesting a potentially harmful overthinking behavior; and 3) Although the CoT quality is high, LMMs with reflection exhibit significant inefficiency in both normal response and self-correction phases. We hope MME-CoT serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mmecot.github.io/</description>

      <title>Embed Any NeRF: Graph Meta-Networks for Neural Tasks on Arbitrary NeRF Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm for representing 3D objects and scenes by encoding shape and appearance information into the weights of a neural network. Recent works have shown how such weights can be used as input to frameworks processing them to solve deep learning tasks. Yet, these frameworks can only process NeRFs with a specific, predefined architecture. In this paper, we present the first framework that can ingest NeRFs with multiple architectures and perform inference on architectures unseen at training time. We achieve this goal by training a Graph Meta-Network in a representation learning framework. Moreover, we show how a contrastive objective is conducive to obtaining an architecture-agnostic latent space. In experiments on both MLP-based and tri-planar NeRFs, our approach demonstrates robust performance in classification and retrieval tasks that either matches or exceeds that of existing frameworks constrained to single architectures, thus providing the first architecture-agnostic method to perform tasks on NeRFs by processing their weights.</description>

      <title>Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Content Preserving Perspective: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-to-image translation (I2I) transforms an image from a source domain to a target domain while preserving source content. Most computer vision applications are in the field of image-to-image translation, such as style transfer, image segmentation, and photo enhancement. The degree of preservation of the content of the source images in the translation process can be different according to the problem and the intended application. From this point of view, in this paper, we divide the different tasks in the field of image-to-image translation into three categories: Fully Content preserving, Partially Content preserving, and Non-Content preserving. We present different tasks, datasets, methods, results of methods for these three categories in this paper. We make a categorization for I2I methods based on the architecture of different models and study each category separately. In addition, we introduce well-known evaluation criteria in the I2I translation field. Specifically, nearly 70 different I2I models were analyzed, and more than 10 quantitative evaluation metrics and 30 distinct tasks and datasets relevant to the I2I translation problem were both introduced and assessed. Translating from simulation to real images could be well viewed as an application of fully content preserving or partially content preserving unsupervised image-to-image translation methods. So, we provide a benchmark for Sim-to-Real translation, which can be used to evaluate different methods. In general, we conclude that because of the different extent of the obligation to preserving content in various applications, it is better to consider this issue in choosing a suitable I2I model for a specific application.</description>

      <title>Color Universal Design Neural Network for the Color Vision Deficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information regarding images should be visually understood by anyone, including those with color deficiency. However, such information is not recognizable if the color that seems to be distorted to the color deficiencies meets an adjacent object. The aim of this paper is to propose a color universal design network, called CUD-Net, that generates images that are visually understandable by individuals with color deficiency. CUD-Net is a convolutional deep neural network that can preserve color and distinguish colors for input images by regressing the node point of a piecewise linear function and using a specific filter for each image. To generate CUD images for color deficiencies, we follow a four-step process. First, we refine the CUD dataset based on specific criteria by color experts. Second, we expand the input image information through pre-processing that is specialized for color deficiency vision. Third, we employ a multi-modality fusion architecture to combine features and process the expanded images. Finally, we propose a conjugate loss function based on the composition of the predicted image through the model to address one-to-many problems that arise from the dataset. Our approach is able to produce high-quality CUD images that maintain color and contrast stability. The code for CUD-Net is available on the GitHub repository</description>

      <title>LIR-LIVO: A Lightweight,Robust LiDAR/Vision/Inertial Odometry with Illumination-Resilient Deep Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose LIR-LIVO, a lightweight and robust LiDAR-inertial-visual odometry system designed for challenging illumination and degraded environments. The proposed method leverages deep learning-based illumination-resilient features and LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry (LIVO). By incorporating advanced techniques such as uniform depth distribution of features enabled by depth association with LiDAR point clouds and adaptive feature matching utilizing Superpoint and LightGlue, LIR-LIVO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and robustness with low computational cost. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including NTU-VIRAL, Hilti'22, and R3LIVE-Dataset. The corresponding results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other SOTA methods on both standard and challenging datasets. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates robust pose estimation under poor ambient lighting conditions in the Hilti'22 dataset. The code of this work is publicly accessible on GitHub to facilitate advancements in the robotics community.</description>

      <title>Skrr: Skip and Re-use Text Encoder Layers for Memory Efficient Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale text encoders in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performance in generating high-quality images from textual prompts. Unlike denoising modules that rely on multiple iterative steps, text encoders require only a single forward pass to produce text embeddings. However, despite their minimal contribution to total inference time and floating-point operations (FLOPs), text encoders demand significantly higher memory usage, up to eight times more than denoising modules. To address this inefficiency, we propose Skip and Re-use layers (Skrr), a simple yet effective pruning strategy specifically designed for text encoders in T2I diffusion models. Skrr exploits the inherent redundancy in transformer blocks by selectively skipping or reusing certain layers in a manner tailored for T2I tasks, thereby reducing memory consumption without compromising performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skrr maintains image quality comparable to the original model even under high sparsity levels, outperforming existing blockwise pruning methods. Furthermore, Skrr achieves state-of-the-art memory efficiency while preserving performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including the FID, CLIP, DreamSim, and GenEval scores.</description>

      <title>MRUCT: Mixed Reality Assistance for Acupuncture Guided by Ultrasonic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chinese acupuncture practitioners primarily depend on muscle memory and tactile feedback to insert needles and accurately target acupuncture points, as the current workflow lacks imaging modalities and visual aids. Consequently, new practitioners often learn through trial and error, requiring years of experience to become proficient and earn the trust of patients. Medical students face similar challenges in mastering this skill. To address these challenges, we developed an innovative system, MRUCT, that integrates ultrasonic computed tomography (UCT) with mixed reality (MR) technology to visualize acupuncture points in real-time. This system offers offline image registration and real-time guidance during needle insertion, enabling them to accurately position needles based on anatomical structures such as bones, muscles, and auto-generated reference points, with the potential for clinical implementation. In this paper, we outline the non-rigid registration methods used to reconstruct anatomical structures from UCT data, as well as the key design considerations of the MR system. We evaluated two different 3D user interface (3DUI) designs and compared the performance of our system to traditional workflows for both new practitioners and medical students. The results highlight the potential of MR to enhance therapeutic medical practices and demonstrate the effectiveness of the system we developed.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.</description>

      <title>Detecting Malicious Concepts Without Image Generation in AIGC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of text-to-image generation has achieved tremendous success in practice, with emerging concept generation models capable of producing highly personalized and customized content. Fervor for concept generation is increasing rapidly among users, and platforms for concept sharing have sprung up. The concept owners may upload malicious concepts and disguise them with non-malicious text descriptions and example images to deceive users into downloading and generating malicious content. The platform needs a quick method to determine whether a concept is malicious to prevent the spread of malicious concepts. However, simply relying on concept image generation to judge whether a concept is malicious requires time and computational resources. Especially, as the number of concepts uploaded and downloaded on the platform continues to increase, this approach becomes impractical and poses a risk of generating malicious content. In this paper, we propose Concept QuickLook, the first systematic work to incorporate malicious concept detection into research, which performs detection based solely on concept files without generating any images. We define malicious concepts and design two work modes for detection: concept matching and fuzzy detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Concept QuickLook can detect malicious concepts and demonstrate practicality in concept sharing platforms. We also design robustness experiments to further validate the effectiveness of the solution. We hope this work can initiate malicious concept detection tasks and provide some inspiration.</description>

      <title>On the Promise for Assurance of Differentiable Neurosymbolic Reasoning Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To create usable and deployable Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, there requires a level of assurance in performance under many different conditions. Many times, deployed machine learning systems will require more classic logic and reasoning performed through neurosymbolic programs jointly with artificial neural network sensing. While many prior works have examined the assurance of a single component of the system solely with either the neural network alone or entire enterprise systems, very few works have examined the assurance of integrated neurosymbolic systems. Within this work, we assess the assurance of end-to-end fully differentiable neurosymbolic systems that are an emerging method to create data-efficient and more interpretable models. We perform this investigation using Scallop, an end-to-end neurosymbolic library, across classification and reasoning tasks in both the image and audio domains. We assess assurance across adversarial robustness, calibration, user performance parity, and interpretability of solutions for catching misaligned solutions. We find end-to-end neurosymbolic methods present unique opportunities for assurance beyond their data efficiency through our empirical results but not across the board. We find that this class of neurosymbolic models has higher assurance in cases where arithmetic operations are defined and where there is high dimensionality to the input space, where fully neural counterparts struggle to learn robust reasoning operations. We identify the relationship between neurosymbolic models' interpretability to catch shortcuts that later result in increased adversarial vulnerability despite performance parity. Finally, we find that the promise of data efficiency is typically only in the case of class imbalanced reasoning problems.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Parrot on LLM's Shoulder: A Summative Assessment of Physical Concept Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a systematic way, we investigate a widely asked question: Do LLMs really understand what they say?, which relates to the more familiar term Stochastic Parrot. To this end, we propose a summative assessment over a carefully designed physical concept understanding task, PhysiCo. Our task alleviates the memorization issue via the usage of grid-format inputs that abstractly describe physical phenomena. The grids represents varying levels of understanding, from the core phenomenon, application examples to analogies to other abstract patterns in the grid world. A comprehensive study on our task demonstrates: (1) state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, o1 and Gemini 2.0 flash thinking, lag behind humans by ~40%; (2) the stochastic parrot phenomenon is present in LLMs, as they fail on our grid task but can describe and recognize the same concepts well in natural language; (3) our task challenges the LLMs due to intrinsic difficulties rather than the unfamiliar grid format, as in-context learning and fine-tuning on same formatted data added little to their performance.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable and intervenable neural network models, which explain their final label prediction by the intermediate prediction of high-level semantic concepts. However, they require target task training to learn input-to-concept and concept-to-label mappings, incurring target dataset collections and training resources. In this paper, we present \textit{zero-shot concept bottleneck models} (Z-CBMs), which predict concepts and labels in a fully zero-shot manner without training neural networks. Z-CBMs utilize a large-scale concept bank, which is composed of millions of vocabulary extracted from the web, to describe arbitrary input in various domains. For the input-to-concept mapping, we introduce concept retrieval, which dynamically finds input-related concepts by the cross-modal search on the concept bank. In the concept-to-label inference, we apply concept regression to select essential concepts from the retrieved concepts by sparse linear regression. Through extensive experiments, we confirm that our Z-CBMs provide interpretable and intervenable concepts without any additional training.

      <title>Improving Deep Regression with Tightness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For deep regression, preserving the ordinality of the targets with respect to the feature representation improves performance across various tasks. However, a theoretical explanation for the benefits of ordinality is still lacking. This work reveals that preserving ordinality reduces the conditional entropy $H(Z|Y)$ of representation $Z$ conditional on the target $Y$. However, our findings reveal that typical regression losses do little to reduce $H(Z|Y)$, even though it is vital for generalization performance. With this motivation, we introduce an optimal transport-based regularizer to preserve the similarity relationships of targets in the feature space to reduce $H(Z|Y)$. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet efficient strategy of duplicating the regressor targets, also with the aim of reducing $H(Z|Y)$. Experiments on three real-world regression tasks verify the effectiveness of our strategies to improve deep regression. Code: https://github.com/needylove/Regression_tightness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Continual Learning (OCL) methods train a model on a non-stationary data stream where only a few examples are available at a time, often leveraging replay strategies. However, usage of replay is sometimes forbidden, especially in applications with strict privacy regulations. Therefore, we propose Continual MultiPatches (CMP), an effective plug-in for existing OCL self-supervised learning strategies that avoids the use of replay samples. CMP generates multiple patches from a single example and projects them into a shared feature space, where patches coming from the same example are pushed together without collapsing into a single point. CMP surpasses replay and other SSL-based strategies on OCL streams, challenging the role of replay as a go-to solution for self-supervised OCL.</description>

      <title>Shortcut Learning Susceptibility in Vision Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shortcut learning, where machine learning models exploit spurious correlations in data instead of capturing meaningful features, poses a significant challenge to building robust and generalizable models. This phenomenon is prevalent across various machine learning applications, including vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition, where models may find unintended cues that minimize training loss but fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. Vision classifiers such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs) leverage distinct architectural principles to process spatial and structural information, making them differently susceptible to shortcut learning. In this study, we systematically evaluate these architectures by introducing deliberate shortcuts into the dataset that are positionally correlated with class labels, creating a controlled setup to assess whether models rely on these artificial cues or learn actual distinguishing features. We perform both quantitative evaluation by training on the shortcut-modified dataset and testing them on two different test sets -- one containing the same shortcuts and another without them -- to determine the extent of reliance on shortcuts. Additionally, qualitative evaluation is performed by using network inversion-based reconstruction techniques to analyze what the models internalize in their weights, aiming to reconstruct the training data as perceived by the classifiers. We evaluate shortcut learning behavior across multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10, to compare the susceptibility of different vision classifier architectures to shortcut reliance and assess their varying degrees of sensitivity to spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>Visual Graph Question Answering with ASP and LLMs for Language Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging problem that requires to process multimodal input. Answer-Set Programming (ASP) has shown great potential in this regard to add interpretability and explainability to modular VQA architectures. In this work, we address the problem of how to integrate ASP with modules for vision and natural language processing to solve a new and demanding VQA variant that is concerned with images of graphs (not graphs in symbolic form). Images containing graph-based structures are an ubiquitous and popular form of visualisation. Here, we deal with the particular problem of graphs inspired by transit networks, and we introduce a novel dataset that amends an existing one by adding images of graphs that resemble metro lines. Our modular neuro-symbolic approach combines optical graph recognition for graph parsing, a pretrained optical character recognition neural network for parsing labels, Large Language Models (LLMs) for language processing, and ASP for reasoning. This method serves as a first baseline and achieves an overall average accuracy of 73% on the dataset. Our evaluation provides further evidence of the potential of modular neuro-symbolic systems, in particular with pretrained models that do not involve any further training and logic programming for reasoning, to solve complex VQA tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design of adversarial attacks for deep neural networks, as well as methods of adversarial training against them, are subject of intense research. In this paper, we propose methods to train against distributional attack threats, extending the TRADES method used for pointwise attacks. Our approach leverages recent contributions and relies on sensitivity analysis for Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization problems. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning method which can be deployed on a previously trained model. We test our methods on a range of pre-trained models on RobustBench. These experimental results demonstrate the additional training enhances Wasserstein distributional robustness, while maintaining original levels of pointwise robustness, even for already very successful networks. The improvements are less marked for models pre-trained using huge synthetic datasets of 20-100M images. However, remarkably, sometimes our methods are still able to improve their performance even when trained using only the original training dataset (50k images).</description>

      <title>Metamorphic Testing for Pose Estimation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pose estimation systems are used in a variety of fields, from sports analytics to livestock care. Given their potential impact, it is paramount to systematically test their behaviour and potential for failure. This is a complex task due to the oracle problem and the high cost of manual labelling necessary to build ground truth keypoints. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that different applications require systems to focus on different subjects (e.g., human versus animal) or landmarks (e.g., only extremities versus whole body and face), which makes labelled test data rarely reusable. To combat these problems we propose MET-POSE, a metamorphic testing framework for pose estimation systems that bypasses the need for manual annotation while assessing the performance of these systems under different circumstances. MET-POSE thus allows users of pose estimation systems to assess the systems in conditions that more closely relate to their application without having to label an ad-hoc test dataset or rely only on available datasets, which may not be adapted to their application domain. While we define MET-POSE in general terms, we also present a non-exhaustive list of metamorphic rules that represent common challenges in computer vision applications, as well as a specific way to evaluate these rules. We then experimentally show the effectiveness of MET-POSE by applying it to Mediapipe Holistic, a state of the art human pose estimation system, with the FLIC and PHOENIX datasets. With these experiments, we outline numerous ways in which the outputs of MET-POSE can uncover faults in pose estimation systems at a similar or higher rate than classic testing using hand labelled data, and show that users can tailor the rule set they use to the faults and level of accuracy relevant to their application.</description>

      <title>DiffRenderGAN: Addressing Training Data Scarcity in Deep Segmentation Networks for Quantitative Nanomaterial Analysis through Differentiable Rendering and Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomaterials exhibit distinctive properties governed by parameters such as size, shape, and surface characteristics, which critically influence their applications and interactions across technological, biological, and environmental contexts. Accurate quantification and understanding of these materials are essential for advancing research and innovation. In this regard, deep learning segmentation networks have emerged as powerful tools that enable automated insights and replace subjective methods with precise quantitative analysis. However, their efficacy depends on representative annotated datasets, which are challenging to obtain due to the costly imaging of nanoparticles and the labor-intensive nature of manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffRenderGAN, a novel generative model designed to produce annotated synthetic data. By integrating a differentiable renderer into a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, DiffRenderGAN optimizes textural rendering parameters to generate realistic, annotated nanoparticle images from non-annotated real microscopy images. This approach reduces the need for manual intervention and enhances segmentation performance compared to existing synthetic data methods by generating diverse and realistic data. Tested on multiple ion and electron microscopy cases, including titanium dioxide (TiO$_2$), silicon dioxide (SiO$_2$)), and silver nanowires (AgNW), DiffRenderGAN bridges the gap between synthetic and real data, advancing the quantification and understanding of complex nanomaterial systems.</description>

      <title>When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires learning of shared representations already in intermediate layers and shared circuitry.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedBench: Comprehensive Benchmarking Multi-modal Large Language Models for Vision-Driven Embodied Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to create embodied agents offers a promising avenue for tackling real-world tasks. While language-centric embodied agents have garnered substantial attention, MLLM-based embodied agents remain underexplored due to the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we introduce EmbodiedBench, an extensive benchmark designed to evaluate vision-driven embodied agents. EmbodiedBench features: (1) a diverse set of 1,128 testing tasks across four environments, ranging from high-level semantic tasks (e.g., household) to low-level tasks involving atomic actions (e.g., navigation and manipulation); and (2) six meticulously curated subsets evaluating essential agent capabilities like commonsense reasoning, complex instruction understanding, spatial awareness, visual perception, and long-term planning. Through extensive experiments, we evaluated 13 leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs within EmbodiedBench. Our findings reveal that: MLLMs excel at high-level tasks but struggle with low-level manipulation, with the best model, GPT-4o, scoring only 28.9% on average. EmbodiedBench provides a multifaceted standardized evaluation platform that not only highlights existing challenges but also offers valuable insights to advance MLLM-based embodied agents. Our code is available at https://embodiedbench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Diffusing DeBias: a Recipe for Turning a Bug into a Feature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning model effectiveness in classification tasks is often challenged by the quality and quantity of training data which, whenever containing strong spurious correlations between specific attributes and target labels, can result in unrecoverable biases in model predictions. Tackling these biases is crucial in improving model generalization and trust, especially in real-world scenarios. This paper presents Diffusing DeBias (DDB), a novel approach acting as a plug-in for common methods in model debiasing while exploiting the inherent bias-learning tendency of diffusion models. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion models to generate synthetic bias-aligned images, used to train a bias amplifier model, to be further employed as an auxiliary method in different unsupervised debiasing approaches. Our proposed method, which also tackles the common issue of training set memorization typical of this type of tech- niques, beats current state-of-the-art in multiple benchmark datasets by significant margins, demonstrating its potential as a versatile and effective tool for tackling dataset bias in deep learning applications.</description>

      <title>Designing a Conditional Prior Distribution for Flow-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently shown impressive performance for conditional generation tasks, such as text-to-image generation. However, current methods transform a general unimodal noise distribution to a specific mode of the target data distribution. As such, every point in the initial source distribution can be mapped to every point in the target distribution, resulting in long average paths. To this end, in this work, we tap into a non-utilized property of conditional flow-based models: the ability to design a non-trivial prior distribution. Given an input condition, such as a text prompt, we first map it to a point lying in data space, representing an ``average" data point with the minimal average distance to all data points of the same conditional mode (e.g., class). We then utilize the flow matching formulation to map samples from a parametric distribution centered around this point to the conditional target distribution. Experimentally, our method significantly improves training times and generation efficiency (FID, KID and CLIP alignment scores) compared to baselines, producing high quality samples using fewer sampling steps.</description>

      <title>DexTrack: Towards Generalizable Neural Tracking Control for Dexterous Manipulation from Human References</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of developing a generalizable neural tracking controller for dexterous manipulation from human references. This controller aims to manage a dexterous robot hand to manipulate diverse objects for various purposes defined by kinematic human-object interactions. Developing such a controller is complicated by the intricate contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation and the need for adaptivity, generalizability, and robustness. Current reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization methods often fall short due to their dependence on task-specific rewards or precise system models. We introduce an approach that curates large-scale successful robot tracking demonstrations, comprising pairs of human references and robot actions, to train a neural controller. Utilizing a data flywheel, we iteratively enhance the controller's performance, as well as the number and quality of successful tracking demonstrations. We exploit available tracking demonstrations and carefully integrate reinforcement learning and imitation learning to boost the controller's performance in dynamic environments. At the same time, to obtain high-quality tracking demonstrations, we individually optimize per-trajectory tracking by leveraging the learned tracking controller in a homotopy optimization method. The homotopy optimization, mimicking chain-of-thought, aids in solving challenging trajectory tracking problems to increase demonstration diversity. We showcase our success by training a generalizable neural controller and evaluating it in both simulation and real world. Our method achieves over a 10% improvement in success rates compared to leading baselines. The project website with animated results is available at https://meowuu7.github.io/DexTrack/.</description>

      <title>Variational Rectified Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Variational Rectified Flow Matching, a framework that enhances classic rectified flow matching by modeling multi-modal velocity vector-fields. At inference time, classic rectified flow matching 'moves' samples from a source distribution to the target distribution by solving an ordinary differential equation via integration along a velocity vector-field. At training time, the velocity vector-field is learnt by linearly interpolating between coupled samples one drawn from the source and one drawn from the target distribution randomly. This leads to ''ground-truth'' velocity vector-fields that point in different directions at the same location, i.e., the velocity vector-fields are multi-modal/ambiguous. However, since training uses a standard mean-squared-error loss, the learnt velocity vector-field averages ''ground-truth'' directions and isn't multi-modal. In contrast, variational rectified flow matching learns and samples from multi-modal flow directions. We show on synthetic data, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet that variational rectified flow matching leads to compelling results.</description>

      <title>Can this Model Also Recognize Dogs? Zero-Shot Model Search from Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing numbers of publicly available models, there are probably pretrained, online models for most tasks users require. However, current model search methods are rudimentary, essentially a text-based search in the documentation, thus users cannot find the relevant models. This paper presents ProbeLog, a method for retrieving classification models that can recognize a target concept, such as "Dog", without access to model metadata or training data. Differently from previous probing methods, ProbeLog computes a descriptor for each output dimension (logit) of each model, by observing its responses on a fixed set of inputs (probes). Our method supports both logit-based retrieval ("find more logits like this") and zero-shot, text-based retrieval ("find all logits corresponding to dogs"). As probing-based representations require multiple costly feedforward passes through the model, we develop a method, based on collaborative filtering, that reduces the cost of encoding repositories by 3x. We demonstrate that ProbeLog achieves high retrieval accuracy, both in real-world and fine-grained search tasks and is scalable to full-size repositories.</description>

      <title>MonoDETR: Depth-guided Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13310v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has long been a challenging task in autonomous driving. Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity. Code is available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/MonoDETR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color vision is essential for human visual perception, but its impact on machine perception is still underexplored. There has been an intensified demand for understanding its role in machine perception for safety-critical tasks such as assistive driving and surgery but lacking suitable datasets. To fill this gap, we curate multipurpose datasets ColorSense, by collecting 110,000 non-trivial human annotations of foreground and background color labels from popular visual recognition benchmarks. To investigate the impact of color vision on machine perception, we assign each image a color discrimination level based on its dominant foreground and background colors and use it to study the impact of color vision on machine perception. We validate the use of our datasets by demonstrating that the level of color discrimination has a dominating effect on the performance of mainstream machine perception models. Specifically, we examine the perception ability of machine vision by considering key factors such as model architecture, training objective, model size, training data, and task complexity. Furthermore, to investigate how color and environmental factors affect the robustness of visual recognition in machine perception, we integrate our ColorSense datasets with image corruptions and perform a more comprehensive visual perception evaluation. Our findings suggest that object recognition tasks such as classification and localization are susceptible to color vision bias, especially for high-stakes cases such as vehicle classes, and advanced mitigation techniques such as data augmentation and so on only give marginal improvement. Our analyses highlight the need for new approaches toward the performance evaluation of machine perception models in real-world applications. Lastly, we present various potential applications of ColorSense such as studying spurious correlations.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Backbone to the Adversarial Robustness of Object Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection is a critical component of various security-sensitive applications, such as autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, existing object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses a significant challenge to their reliability and security. Through experiments, first, we found that existing works on improving the adversarial robustness of object detectors give a false sense of security. Second, we found that adversarially pre-trained backbone networks were essential for enhancing the adversarial robustness of object detectors. We then proposed a simple yet effective recipe for fast adversarial fine-tuning on object detectors with adversarially pre-trained backbones. Without any modifications to the structure of object detectors, our recipe achieved significantly better adversarial robustness than previous works. Finally, we explored the potential of different modern object detector designs for improving adversarial robustness with our recipe and demonstrated interesting findings, which inspired us to design state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust detectors. Our empirical results set a new milestone for adversarially robust object detection. Code and trained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/oddefense.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Asymmetric Contrastive Learning for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation Pre-training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the arduous process of acquiring large volumes of high-quality labeled data from experts. Contrastive learning offers a promising but still problematic solution to this dilemma. Firstly existing medical contrastive learning strategies focus on extracting image-level representation, which ignores abundant multi-level representations. Furthermore they underutilize the decoder either by random initialization or separate pre-training from the encoder, thereby neglecting the potential collaboration between the encoder and decoder. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-level asymmetric contrastive learning framework named MACL for volumetric medical image segmentation pre-training. Specifically, we design an asymmetric contrastive learning structure to pre-train encoder and decoder simultaneously to provide better initialization for segmentation models. Moreover, we develop a multi-level contrastive learning strategy that integrates correspondences across feature-level, image-level, and pixel-level representations to ensure the encoder and decoder capture comprehensive details from representations of varying scales and granularities during the pre-training phase. Finally, experiments on 8 medical image datasets indicate our MACL framework outperforms existing 11 contrastive learning strategies. i.e. Our MACL achieves a superior performance with more precise predictions from visualization figures and 1.72%, 7.87%, 2.49% and 1.48% Dice higher than previous best results on ACDC, MMWHS, HVSMR and CHAOS with 10% labeled data, respectively. And our MACL also has a strong generalization ability among 5 variant U-Net backbones. Our code will be released at https://github.com/stevezs315/MACL.</description>

      <title>Grid Jigsaw Representation with CLIP: A New Perspective on Image Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning for image clustering is essential in computer vision. Although the advancement of visual models has improved image clustering with efficient visual representations, challenges still remain. Firstly, existing features often lack the ability to represent the internal structure of images, hindering the accurate clustering of visually similar images. Secondly, finer-grained semantic labels are often missing, limiting the ability to capture nuanced differences and similarities between images. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on image clustering, the pretrain-based Grid Jigsaw Representation (pGJR). Inspired by human jigsaw puzzle processing, we modify the traditional jigsaw learning to gain a more sequential and incremental understanding of image structure. We also leverage the pretrained CLIP to extract the prior features which can benefit from the enhanced cross-modal representation for richer and more nuanced semantic information and label level differentiation. Our experiments demonstrate that using the pretrained model as a feature extractor can accelerate the convergence of clustering. We append the GJR module to pGJR and observe significant improvements on common-use benchmark datasets. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in the clustering task, as evidenced by improvements in the ACC, NMI, and ARI metrics, as well as the super-fast convergence speed.</description>

      <title>Boosting Segment Anything Model Towards Open-Vocabulary Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) has emerged as a new paradigmatic vision foundation model, showcasing potent zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting. Despite SAM finding applications and adaptations in various domains, its primary limitation lies in the inability to grasp object semantics. In this paper, we present Sambor to seamlessly integrate SAM with the open-vocabulary object detector in an end-to-end framework. While retaining all the remarkable capabilities inherent to SAM, we boost it to detect arbitrary objects from human inputs like category names or reference expressions. Building upon the SAM image encoder, we introduce a novel SideFormer module designed to acquire SAM features adept at perceiving objects and inject comprehensive semantic information for recognition. In addition, we devise an Open-set RPN that leverages SAM proposals to assist in finding potential objects. Consequently, Sambor enables the open-vocabulary detector to equally focus on generalizing both localization and classification sub-tasks. Our approach demonstrates superior zero-shot performance across benchmarks, including COCO and LVIS, proving highly competitive against previous state-of-the-art methods. We aspire for this work to serve as a meaningful endeavor in endowing SAM to recognize diverse object categories and advancing open-vocabulary learning with the support of vision foundation models.</description>

      <title>Learning Naturally Aggregated Appearance for Efficient 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural radiance fields, which represent a 3D scene as a color field and a density field, have demonstrated great progress in novel view synthesis yet are unfavorable for editing due to the implicitness. This work studies the task of efficient 3D editing, where we focus on editing speed and user interactivity. To this end, we propose to learn the color field as an explicit 2D appearance aggregation, also called canonical image, with which users can easily customize their 3D editing via 2D image processing. We complement the canonical image with a projection field that maps 3D points onto 2D pixels for texture query. This field is initialized with a pseudo canonical camera model and optimized with offset regularity to ensure the naturalness of the canonical image. Extensive experiments on different datasets suggest that our representation, dubbed AGAP, well supports various ways of 3D editing (e.g., stylization, instance segmentation, and interactive drawing). Our approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency by being at least 20 times faster per edit compared to existing NeRF-based editing methods.

      <title>Vision-LLMs Can Fool Themselves with Self-Generated Typographic Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typographic attacks, adding misleading text to images, can deceive vision-language models (LVLMs). The susceptibility of recent large LVLMs like GPT4-V to such attacks is understudied, raising concerns about amplified misinformation in personal assistant applications. Previous attacks use simple strategies, such as random misleading words, which don't fully exploit LVLMs' language reasoning abilities. We introduce an experimental setup for testing typographic attacks on LVLMs and propose two novel self-generated attacks: (1) Class-based attacks, where the model identifies a similar class to deceive itself, and (2) Reasoned attacks, where an advanced LVLM suggests an attack combining a deceiving class and description. Our experiments show these attacks significantly reduce classification performance by up to 60\% and are effective across different models, including InstructBLIP and MiniGPT4.

      <title>Boosting Semi-Supervised 2D Human Pose Estimation by Revisiting Data Augmentation and Consistency Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2D human pose estimation (HPE) is a basic visual problem. However, its supervised learning requires massive keypoint labels, which is labor-intensive to collect. Thus, we aim at boosting a pose estimator by excavating extra unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning (SSL). Most previous SSHPE methods are consistency-based and strive to maintain consistent outputs for differently augmented inputs. Under this genre, we find that SSHPE can be boosted from two cores: advanced data augmentations and concise consistency training ways. Specifically, for the first core, we discover the synergistic effects of existing augmentations, and reveal novel paradigms for conveniently producing new superior HPE-oriented augmentations which can more effectively add noise on unlabeled samples. We can therefore establish paired easy-hard augmentations with larger difficulty gaps. For the second core, we propose to repeatedly augment unlabeled images with diverse hard augmentations, and generate multi-path predictions sequentially for optimizing multi-losses in a single network. This simple and compact design is interpretable, and easily benefits from newly found augmentations. Comparing to state-of-the-art SSL approaches, our method brings substantial improvements on public datasets. And we extensively validate the superiority and versatility of our approach on conventional human body images, overhead fisheye images, and human hand images. The code is released in https://github.com/hnuzhy/MultiAugs.</description>

      <title>EventZoom: A Progressive Approach to Event-Based Data Augmentation for Enhanced Neuromorphic Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) capture event data with high temporal resolution and low power consumption, presenting a more efficient solution for visual processing in dynamic and real-time scenarios compared to conventional video capture methods. Event data augmentation serve as an essential method for overcoming the limitation of scale and diversity in event datasets. Our comparative experiments demonstrate that the two factors, spatial integrity and temporal continuity, can significantly affect the capacity of event data augmentation, which are guarantee for maintaining the sparsity and high dynamic range characteristics unique to event data. However, existing augmentation methods often neglect the preservation of spatial integrity and temporal continuity. To address this, we developed a novel event data augmentation strategy EventZoom, which employs a temporal progressive strategy, embedding transformed samples into the original samples through progressive scaling and shifting. The scaling process avoids the spatial information loss associated with cropping, while the progressive strategy prevents interruptions or abrupt changes in temporal information. We validated EventZoom across various supervised learning frameworks. The experimental results show that EventZoom consistently outperforms existing event data augmentation methods with SOTA performance. For the first time, we have concurrently employed Semi-supervised and Unsupervised learning to verify feasibility on event augmentation algorithms, demonstrating the applicability and effectiveness of EventZoom as a powerful event-based data augmentation tool in handling real-world scenes with high dynamics and variability environments.</description>

      <title>Open-YOLO 3D: Towards Fast and Accurate Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works on open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation show strong promise, but at the cost of slow inference speed and high computation requirements. This high computation cost is typically due to their heavy reliance on 3D clip features, which require computationally expensive 2D foundation models like Segment Anything (SAM) and CLIP for multi-view aggregation into 3D. As a consequence, this hampers their applicability in many real-world applications that require both fast and accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a fast yet accurate open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation approach, named Open-YOLO 3D, that effectively leverages only 2D object detection from multi-view RGB images for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. We address this task by generating class-agnostic 3D masks for objects in the scene and associating them with text prompts. We observe that the projection of class-agnostic 3D point cloud instances already holds instance information; thus, using SAM might only result in redundancy that unnecessarily increases the inference time. We empirically find that a better performance of matching text prompts to 3D masks can be achieved in a faster fashion with a 2D object detector. We validate our Open-YOLO 3D on two benchmarks, ScanNet200 and Replica, under two scenarios: (i) with ground truth masks, where labels are required for given object proposals, and (ii) with class-agnostic 3D proposals generated from a 3D proposal network. Our Open-YOLO 3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while obtaining up to $\sim$16$\times$ speedup compared to the best existing method in literature. On ScanNet200 val. set, our Open-YOLO 3D achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24.7\% while operating at 22 seconds per scene.

      <title>Interpreting the Second-Order Effects of Neurons in CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret the function of individual neurons in CLIP by automatically describing them using text. Analyzing the direct effects (i.e. the flow from a neuron through the residual stream to the output) or the indirect effects (overall contribution) fails to capture the neurons' function in CLIP. Therefore, we present the "second-order lens", analyzing the effect flowing from a neuron through the later attention heads, directly to the output. We find that these effects are highly selective: for each neuron, the effect is significant for &lt;2% of the images. Moreover, each effect can be approximated by a single direction in the text-image space of CLIP. We describe neurons by decomposing these directions into sparse sets of text representations. The sets reveal polysemantic behavior - each neuron corresponds to multiple, often unrelated, concepts (e.g. ships and cars). Exploiting this neuron polysemy, we mass-produce "semantic" adversarial examples by generating images with concepts spuriously correlated to the incorrect class. Additionally, we use the second-order effects for zero-shot segmentation, outperforming previous methods. Our results indicate that an automated interpretation of neurons can be used for model deception and for introducing new model capabilities.</description>

      <title>UEMM-Air: Make Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Perform More Multi-modal Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of multi-modal learning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) typically relies on a large amount of pixel-aligned multi-modal image data. However, existing datasets face challenges such as limited modalities, high construction costs, and imprecise annotations. To this end, we propose a synthetic multi-modal UAV-based multi-task dataset, UEMM-Air. Specifically, we simulate various UAV flight scenarios and object types using the Unreal Engine (UE). Then we design the UAV's flight logic to automatically collect data from different scenarios, perspectives, and altitudes. Furthermore, we propose a novel heuristic automatic annotation algorithm to generate accurate object detection labels. Finally, we utilize labels to generate text descriptions of images to make our UEMM-Air support more cross-modality tasks. In total, our UEMM-Air consists of 120k pairs of images with 6 modalities and precise annotations. Moreover, we conduct numerous experiments and establish new benchmark results on our dataset. We also found that models pre-trained on UEMM-Air exhibit better performance on downstream tasks compared to other similar datasets. The dataset is publicly available (https://github.com/1e12Leon/UEMM-Air) to support the research of multi-modal tasks on UAVs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to generate 3D objects in styles. Our method takes a text prompt and a style reference image as input and reconstructs a neural radiance field to synthesize a 3D model with the content aligning with the text prompt and the style following the reference image. To simultaneously generate the 3D object and perform style transfer in one go, we propose a stylized score distillation loss to guide a text-to-3D optimization process to output visually plausible geometry and appearance. Our stylized score distillation is based on a combination of an original pretrained text-to-image model and its modified sibling with the key and value features of self-attention layers manipulated to inject styles from the reference image. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrated the strong visual performance of our method, further supported by the quantitative results from our user study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently garnered significant attention thanks to the large multi-modality model Sora. However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, and diffusion-based models for image restoration have garnered significant attention due to their ability to produce realistic results. Restoration can be seen as a controllable generation conditioning on priors. However, due to the severity of image degradation, existing diffusion-based restoration methods cannot fully exploit priors from low-quality images and still have many challenges in perceptual quality, semantic fidelity, and structure accuracy. Based on the challenges, we introduce a novel image restoration method, SSP-IR. Our approach aims to fully exploit semantic and structure priors from low-quality images to guide the diffusion model in generating semantically faithful and structurally accurate natural restoration results. Specifically, we integrate the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (explicit) and the visual representations of the original image (implicit) to acquire accurate semantic prior. To extract degradation-independent structure prior, we introduce a Processor with RGB and FFT constraints to extract structure prior from the low-quality images, guiding the diffusion model and preventing the generation of unreasonable artifacts. Lastly, we employ a multi-level attention mechanism to integrate the acquired semantic and structure priors. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods overall on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2408.07422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, robotics, and embodied intelligence have necessitated 3D perception algorithms. However, current 3D perception methods, especially specialized small models, exhibit poor generalization in open scenarios. On the other hand, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in general capacity but underperform in 3D tasks, due to weak 3D local spatial object perception, poor text-based geometric numerical output, and inability to handle camera focal variations. To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions: Spatial-Enhanced Local Feature Mining for better spatial feature extraction, 3D Query Token-Derived Info Decoding for precise geometric regression, and Geometry Projection-Based 3D Reasoning for handling camera focal length variations. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for a pre-trained MLLM and develop LLMI3D, a powerful 3D perception MLLM. Additionally, we have constructed the IG3D dataset, which provides fine-grained descriptions and question-answer annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LLMI3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other methods by a large margin.</description>

      <title>Locate Anything on Earth: Advancing Open-Vocabulary Object Detection for Remote Sensing Community</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Object detection, particularly open-vocabulary object detection, plays a crucial role in Earth sciences, such as environmental monitoring, natural disaster assessment, and land-use planning. However, existing open-vocabulary detectors, primarily trained on natural-world images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing images due to a significant data domain gap. Thus, this paper aims to advance the development of open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing community. To achieve this, we first reformulate the task as Locate Anything on Earth (LAE) with the goal of detecting any novel concepts on Earth. We then developed the LAE-Label Engine which collects, auto-annotates, and unifies up to 10 remote sensing datasets creating the LAE-1M - the first large-scale remote sensing object detection dataset with broad category coverage. Using the LAE-1M, we further propose and train the novel LAE-DINO Model, the first open-vocabulary foundation object detector for the LAE task, featuring Dynamic Vocabulary Construction (DVC) and Visual-Guided Text Prompt Learning (VisGT) modules. DVC dynamically constructs vocabulary for each training batch, while VisGT maps visual features to semantic space, enhancing text features. We comprehensively conduct experiments on established remote sensing benchmark DIOR, DOTAv2.0, as well as our newly introduced 80-class LAE-80C benchmark. Results demonstrate the advantages of the LAE-1M dataset and the effectiveness of the LAE-DINO method.</description>

      <title>RenderWorld: World Model with Self-Supervised 3D Label</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving with vision-only is not only more cost-effective compared to LiDAR-vision fusion but also more reliable than traditional methods. To achieve a economical and robust purely visual autonomous driving system, we propose RenderWorld, a vision-only end-to-end autonomous driving framework, which generates 3D occupancy labels using a self-supervised gaussian-based Img2Occ Module, then encodes the labels by AM-VAE, and uses world model for forecasting and planning. RenderWorld employs Gaussian Splatting to represent 3D scenes and render 2D images greatly improves segmentation accuracy and reduces GPU memory consumption compared with NeRF-based methods. By applying AM-VAE to encode air and non-air separately, RenderWorld achieves more fine-grained scene element representation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in both 4D occupancy forecasting and motion planning from autoregressive world model.</description>

      <title>Two Stage Segmentation of Cervical Tumors using PocketNet</title>

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains the fourth most common malignancy amongst women worldwide.1 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) serves as the mainstay definitive treatment regimen for locally advanced cervical cancers and includes external beam radiation followed by brachytherapy.2 Integral to radiotherapy treatment planning is the routine contouring of both the target tumor at the level of the cervix, associated gynecologic anatomy and the adjacent organs at risk (OARs). However, manual contouring of these structures is both time and labor intensive and associated with known interobserver variability that can impact treatment outcomes. While multiple tools have been developed to automatically segment OARs and the high-risk clinical tumor volume (HR-CTV) using computed tomography (CT) images,3,4,5,6 the development of deep learning-based tumor segmentation tools using routine T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) addresses an unmet clinical need to improve the routine contouring of both anatomical structures and cervical cancers, thereby increasing quality and consistency of radiotherapy planning. This work applied a novel deep-learning model (PocketNet) to segment the cervix, vagina, uterus, and tumor(s) on T2w MRI. The performance of the PocketNet architecture was evaluated, when trained on data via five-fold cross validation. PocketNet achieved a mean Dice-Sorensen similarity coefficient (DSC) exceeding 70% for tumor segmentation and 80% for organ segmentation. Validation on a publicly available dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) demonstrated the models robustness, achieving DSC scores of 67.3% for tumor segmentation and 80.8% for organ segmentation. These results suggest that PocketNet is robust to variations in contrast protocols, providing reliable segmentation of the regions of interest.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Det: Learning Closed-Surface Gaussians for 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and recall.</description>

      <title>4-LEGS: 4D Language Embedded Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of neural representations has revolutionized our means for digitally viewing a wide range of 3D scenes, enabling the synthesis of photorealistic images rendered from novel views. Recently, several techniques have been proposed for connecting these low-level representations with the high-level semantics understanding embodied within the scene. These methods elevate the rich semantic understanding from 2D imagery to 3D representations, distilling high-dimensional spatial features onto 3D space. In our work, we are interested in connecting language with a dynamic modeling of the world. We show how to lift spatio-temporal features to a 4D representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. This enables an interactive interface where the user can spatiotemporally localize events in the video from text prompts. We demonstrate our system on public 3D video datasets of people and animals performing various actions.</description>

      <title>Sitcom-Crafter: A Plot-Driven Human Motion Generation System in 3D Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in human motion synthesis have focused on specific types of motions, such as human-scene interaction, locomotion or human-human interaction, however, there is a lack of a unified system capable of generating a diverse combination of motion types. In response, we introduce Sitcom-Crafter, a comprehensive and extendable system for human motion generation in 3D space, which can be guided by extensive plot contexts to enhance workflow efficiency for anime and game designers. The system is comprised of eight modules, three of which are dedicated to motion generation, while the remaining five are augmentation modules that ensure consistent fusion of motion sequences and system functionality. Central to the generation modules is our novel 3D scene-aware human-human interaction module, which addresses collision issues by synthesizing implicit 3D Signed Distance Function (SDF) points around motion spaces, thereby minimizing human-scene collisions without additional data collection costs. Complementing this, our locomotion and human-scene interaction modules leverage existing methods to enrich the system's motion generation capabilities. Augmentation modules encompass plot comprehension for command generation, motion synchronization for seamless integration of different motion types, hand pose retrieval to enhance motion realism, motion collision revision to prevent human collisions, and 3D retargeting to ensure visual fidelity. Experimental evaluations validate the system's ability to generate high-quality, diverse, and physically realistic motions, underscoring its potential for advancing creative workflows.

      <title>Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/prmudgal/CWAM_IC_ISVC. .</description>

      <title>Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive LiDAR sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of LiDAR sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of LiDAR sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves the vanilla TransL baseline and other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Heuristical Comparison of Vision Transformers Against Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently brought a new wave of research in the field of computer vision. These models have performed particularly well in image classification and segmentation. Research on semantic and instance segmentation has accelerated with the introduction of the new architecture, with over 80% of the top 20 benchmarks for the iSAID dataset based on either the ViT architecture or the attention mechanism behind its success. This paper focuses on the heuristic comparison of three key factors of using (or not using) ViT for semantic segmentation of remote sensing aerial images on the iSAID dataset. The experimental results observed during this research were analyzed based on three objectives. First, we studied the use of a weighted fused loss function to maximize the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) score and Dice score while minimizing entropy or class representation loss. Second, we compared transfer learning on Meta's MaskFormer, a ViT-based semantic segmentation model, against a generic UNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on mIoU, Dice scores, training efficiency, and inference time. Third, we examined the trade-offs between the two models in comparison to current state-of-the-art segmentation models. We show that the novel combined weighted loss function significantly boosts the CNN model's performance compared to transfer learning with ViT. The code for this implementation can be found at: https://github.com/ashimdahal/ViT-vs-CNN-Image-Segmentation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Video-LLM Reasoning via Agent-of-Thoughts Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of video question answering (VideoQA), a task that often requires multi-step reasoning and a profound understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics. While large video-language models perform well on benchmarks, they often lack explainability and spatial-temporal grounding. In this paper, we propose Agent-of-Thoughts Distillation (AoTD), a method that enhances models by incorporating automatically generated Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) into the instruction-tuning process. Specifically, we leverage an agent-based system to decompose complex questions into sub-tasks, and address them with specialized vision models, the intermediate results are then treated as reasoning chains. We also introduce a verification mechanism using a large language model (LLM) to ensure the reliability of generated CoTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AoTD improves the performance on multiple-choice and open-ended benchmarks.</description>

      <title>VIIS: Visible and Infrared Information Synthesis for Severe Low-light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Images captured in severe low-light circumstances often suffer from significant information absence. Existing singular modality image enhancement methods struggle to restore image regions lacking valid information. By leveraging light-impervious infrared images, visible and infrared image fusion methods have the potential to reveal information hidden in darkness. However, they primarily emphasize inter-modal complementation but neglect intra-modal enhancement, limiting the perceptual quality of output images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, dubbed visible and infrared information synthesis (VIIS), which aims to achieve both information enhancement and fusion of the two modalities. Given the difficulty in obtaining ground truth in the VIIS task, we design an information synthesis pretext task (ISPT) based on image augmentation. We employ a diffusion model as the framework and design a sparse attention-based dual-modalities residual (SADMR) conditioning mechanism to enhance information interaction between the two modalities. This mechanism enables features with prior knowledge from both modalities to adaptively and iteratively attend to each modality's information during the denoising process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms not only the state-of-the-art methods in relevant fields but also the newly designed baselines capable of both information enhancement and fusion.

      <title>Sa2VA: Marrying SAM2 with LLaVA for Dense Grounded Understanding of Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents Sa2VA, the first unified model for dense grounded understanding of both images and videos. Unlike existing multi-modal large language models, which are often limited to specific modalities and tasks, Sa2VA supports a wide range of image and video tasks, including referring segmentation and conversation, with minimal one-shot instruction tuning. Sa2VA combines SAM-2, a foundation video segmentation model, with LLaVA, an advanced vision-language model, and unifies text, image, and video into a shared LLM token space. Using the LLM, Sa2VA generates instruction tokens that guide SAM-2 in producing precise masks, enabling a grounded, multi-modal understanding of both static and dynamic visual content. Additionally, we introduce Ref-SAV, an auto-labeled dataset containing over 72k object expressions in complex video scenes, designed to boost model performance. We also manually validate 2k video objects in the Ref-SAV datasets to benchmark referring video object segmentation in complex environments. Experiments show that Sa2VA achieves state-of-the-art across multiple tasks, particularly in referring video object segmentation, highlighting its potential for complex real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Surface Vision Mamba: Leveraging Bidirectional State Space Model for Efficient Spherical Manifold Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attention-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in modelling long-range dependencies on spherical cortical surfaces, surpassing traditional Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) models. However, their extensive inference time and high memory demands pose challenges for application to large datasets with limited computing resources. Inspired by the state space model in computer vision, we introduce the attention-free Vision Mamba (Vim) to spherical surfaces, presenting a domain-agnostic architecture for analyzing data on spherical manifolds. Our method achieves surface patching by representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches derived from a subdivided icosphere. The proposed Surface Vision Mamba (SiM) is evaluated on multiple neurodevelopmental phenotype regression tasks using cortical surface metrics from neonatal brains. Experimental results demonstrate that SiM outperforms both attention- and GDL-based methods, delivering 4.8 times faster inference and achieving 91.7% lower memory consumption compared to the Surface Vision Transformer (SiT) under the Ico-4 grid partitioning. Sensitivity analysis further underscores the potential of SiM to identify subtle cognitive developmental patterns.

      <title>OmniHuman-1: Rethinking the Scaling-Up of One-Stage Conditioned Human Animation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation, has undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals). Video samples are provided on the ttfamily project page (https://omnihuman-lab.github.io)</description>

      <title>Evolving Symbolic 3D Visual Grounder with Weakly Supervised Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) is challenging because of the requirement of understanding on visual information, language and spatial relationships. While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high cost of 3D vision-language datasets. On the other hand, LLM/VLM based agents are proposed for 3DVG, eliminating the need for training data. However, these methods incur prohibitive time and token costs during inference. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel training-free symbolic framework for 3D visual grounding, namely Evolvable Symbolic Visual Grounder, that offers significantly reduced inference costs compared to previous agent-based methods while maintaining comparable performance. EaSe uses LLM generated codes to compute on spatial relationships. EaSe also implements an automatic pipeline to evaluate and optimize the quality of these codes and integrate VLMs to assist in the grounding process. Experimental results demonstrate that EaSe achieves 52.9% accuracy on Nr3D dataset and 49.2% Acc@0.25 on ScanRefer, which is top-tier among training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the inference time and cost, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present synthetic data generation framework for flood hazard detection system. For high fidelity and quality, we characterize several real-world properties into virtual world and simulate the flood situation by controlling them. For the sake of efficiency, recent generative models in image-to-3D and urban city synthesis are leveraged to easily composite flood environments so that we avoid data bias due to the hand-crafted manner. Based on our framework, we build the flood synthetic dataset with 5 levels, dubbed MultiFloodSynth which contains rich annotation types like normal map, segmentation, 3D bounding box for a variety of downstream task. In experiments, our dataset demonstrate the enhanced performance of flood hazard detection with on-par realism compared with real dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Feature-based Image Stitching for Endoscopic Videos in Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video endoscopy represents a major advance in the investigation of gastrointestinal diseases. Reviewing endoscopy videos often involves frequent adjustments and reorientations to piece together a complete view, which can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. Image stitching techniques address this issue by providing a continuous and complete visualization of the examined area. However, endoscopic images, particularly those of the esophagus, present unique challenges. The smooth surface, lack of distinct feature points, and non-horizontal orientation complicate the stitching process, rendering traditional feature-based methods often ineffective for these types of images. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing pipeline designed to enhance endoscopic image stitching through advanced computational techniques. Our approach converts endoscopic video data into continuous 2D images by following four key steps: (1) keyframe selection, (2) image rotation adjustment to correct distortions, (3) surface unwrapping using polar coordinate transformation to generate a flat image, and (4) feature point matching enhanced by Adaptive Histogram Equalization for improved feature detection. We evaluate stitching quality through the assessment of valid feature point match pairs. Experiments conducted on 20 pediatric endoscopy videos demonstrate that our method significantly improves image alignment and stitching quality compared to traditional techniques, laying a robust foundation for more effective panoramic image creation.</description>

      <title>Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Into Spectral Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling waves are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' problem -- which highlights how spectral modes encode geometric information -- we introduce a set of convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli. By applying a spectral decomposition to these wave-like activations, we obtain a powerful new representational space that outperforms equivalently local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism and spectral readouts solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, where local feed-forward models fail. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based representations in artificial networks, our findings suggest potential efficiency benefits and offer a new framework for connecting to biological recordings of neural activity.</description>

      <title>CANeRV: Content Adaptive Neural Representation for Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in video compression introduce implicit neural representation (INR) based methods, which effectively capture global dependencies and characteristics of entire video sequences. Unlike traditional and deep learning based approaches, INR-based methods optimize network parameters from a global perspective, resulting in superior compression potential. However, most current INR methods utilize a fixed and uniform network architecture across all frames, limiting their adaptability to dynamic variations within and between video sequences. This often leads to suboptimal compression outcomes as these methods struggle to capture the distinct nuances and transitions in video content. To overcome these challenges, we propose Content Adaptive Neural Representation for Video Compression (CANeRV), an innovative INR-based video compression network that adaptively conducts structure optimisation based on the specific content of each video sequence. To better capture dynamic information across video sequences, we propose a dynamic sequence-level adjustment (DSA). Furthermore, to enhance the capture of dynamics between frames within a sequence, we implement a dynamic frame-level adjustment (DFA). {Finally, to effectively capture spatial structural information within video frames, thereby enhancing the detail restoration capabilities of CANeRV, we devise a structure level hierarchical structural adaptation (HSA).} Experimental results demonstrate that CANeRV can outperform both H.266/VVC and state-of-the-art INR-based video compression techniques across diverse video datasets.</description>

      <title>Illegal Waste Detection in Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental crime currently represents the third largest criminal activity worldwide while threatening ecosystems as well as human health. Among the crimes related to this activity, improper waste management can nowadays be countered more easily thanks to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing images, which enable semi-automatic territory scanning in search of illegal landfills. This paper proposes a pipeline, developed in collaboration with professionals from a local environmental agency, for detecting candidate illegal dumping sites leveraging a classifier of Remote Sensing images. To identify the best configuration for such classifier, an extensive set of experiments was conducted and the impact of diverse image characteristics and training settings was thoroughly analyzed. The local environmental agency was then involved in an experimental exercise where outputs from the developed classifier were integrated in the experts' everyday work, resulting in time savings with respect to manual photo-interpretation. The classifier was eventually run with valuable results on a location outside of the training area, highlighting potential for cross-border applicability of the proposed pipeline.</description>

      <title>ArthroPhase: A Novel Dataset and Method for Phase Recognition in Arthroscopic Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to advance surgical phase recognition in arthroscopic procedures, specifically Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, by introducing the first arthroscopy dataset and developing a novel transformer-based model. We aim to establish a benchmark for arthroscopic surgical phase recognition by leveraging spatio-temporal features to address the specific challenges of arthroscopic videos including limited field of view, occlusions, and visual distortions. We developed the ACL27 dataset, comprising 27 videos of ACL surgeries, each labeled with surgical phases. Our model employs a transformer-based architecture, utilizing temporal-aware frame-wise feature extraction through a ResNet-50 and transformer layers. This approach integrates spatio-temporal features and introduces a Surgical Progress Index (SPI) to quantify surgery progression. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and Jaccard Index on the ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets. The proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 72.91% on the ACL27 dataset. On the Cholec80 dataset, the model achieved a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 92.4%. The SPI demonstrated an output error of 10.6% and 9.86% on ACL27 and Cholec80 datasets respectively, indicating reliable surgery progression estimation. This study introduces a significant advancement in surgical phase recognition for arthroscopy, providing a comprehensive dataset and a robust transformer-based model. The results validate the model's effectiveness and generalizability, highlighting its potential to improve surgical training, real-time assistance, and operational efficiency in orthopedic surgery. The publicly available dataset and code will facilitate future research and development in this critical field.</description>

Abstract: DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.</description>

      <title>NanoVLMs: How small can we go and still make coherent Vision Language Models?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT-4V and Llama 3.2 vision, have garnered significant research attention for their ability to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks. However, their potential is constrained by inherent challenges, including proprietary restrictions, substantial computational demands, and limited accessibility. Smaller models, such as GIT and BLIP, exhibit marked limitations, often failing to generate coherent and consistent text beyond a few tokens, even with extensive training. This underscores a pivotal inquiry: how small can a VLM be and still produce fluent and consistent text? Drawing inspiration from the exceptional learning process of 3-4 year old children, who rely heavily on visual cues for understanding and communication, we introduce two novel datasets: ShortDesc (featuring concise image descriptions) and LongDesc (containing more detailed image descriptions). These datasets consist of image-text pairs where the text is restricted to the simple vocabulary and syntax typically used by young children, generated with a scaled- down model, GPT-4o. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that it is possible to train VLMs that are significantly smaller, up to 10 times smaller than state of the art(SOTA) small VLMs while maintaining architectural simplicity. To evaluate the outputs, we leverage GPT-4o to grade the text, as if stories written by students, on creativity, meaningfulness, and consistency, assigning scores out of 10. This method addresses limitations of standard benchmarks by accommodating unstructured outputs and providing a multidimensional evaluation of the model capabilities. Our findings contribute to the development of lightweight, accessible multimodal models for resource constrained environments.</description>

      <title>MRS: A Fast Sampler for Mean Reverting Diffusion based on ODE and SDE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation.</description>

      <title>When do they StOP?: A First Step Towards Automatically Identifying Team Communication in the Operating Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Surgical performance depends not only on surgeons' technical skills but also on team communication within and across the different professional groups present during the operation. Therefore, automatically identifying team communication in the OR is crucial for patient safety and advances in the development of computer-assisted surgical workflow analysis and intra-operative support systems. To take the first step, we propose a new task of detecting communication briefings involving all OR team members, i.e. the team Time-out and the StOP?-protocol, by localizing their start and end times in video recordings of surgical operations. Methods: We generate an OR dataset of real surgeries, called Team-OR, with more than one hundred hours of surgical videos captured by the multi-view camera system in the OR. The dataset contains temporal annotations of 33 Time-out and 22 StOP?-protocol activities in total. We then propose a novel group activity detection approach, where we encode both scene context and action features, and use an efficient neural network model to output the results. Results: The experimental results on the Team-OR dataset show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art temporal action detection approaches. It also demonstrates the lack of research on group activities in the OR, proving the significance of our dataset. Conclusion: We investigate the Team Time-Out and the StOP?-protocol in the OR, by presenting the first OR dataset with temporal annotations of group activities protocols, and introducing a novel group activity detection approach that outperforms existing approaches.

      <title>Moment of Untruth: Dealing with Negative Queries in Video Moment Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a common task to evaluate the performance of visual-language models - it involves localising start and end times of moments in videos from query sentences. The current task formulation assumes that the queried moment is present in the video, resulting in false positive moment predictions when irrelevant query sentences are provided. In this paper we propose the task of Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval (NA-VMR), which considers both moment retrieval accuracy and negative query rejection accuracy. We make the distinction between In-Domain and Out-of-Domain negative queries and provide new evaluation benchmarks for two popular video moment retrieval datasets: QVHighlights and Charades-STA. We analyse the ability of current SOTA video moment retrieval approaches to adapt to Negative-Aware Video Moment Retrieval and propose UniVTG-NA, an adaptation of UniVTG designed to tackle NA-VMR. UniVTG-NA achieves high negative rejection accuracy (avg. $98.4\%$) scores while retaining moment retrieval scores to within $3.87\%$ Recall@1.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present PulseCheck457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.</description>

      <title>For Better or For Worse? Learning Minimum Variance Features With Label Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation has been pivotal in successfully training deep learning models on classification tasks over the past decade. An important subclass of data augmentation techniques - which includes both label smoothing and Mixup - involves modifying not only the input data but also the input label during model training. In this work, we analyze the role played by the label augmentation aspect of such methods. We first prove that linear models on binary classification data trained with label augmentation learn only the minimum variance features in the data, while standard training (which includes weight decay) can learn higher variance features. We then use our techniques to show that even for nonlinear models and general data distributions, the label smoothing and Mixup losses are lower bounded by a function of the model output variance. Lastly, we demonstrate empirically that this aspect of label smoothing and Mixup can be a positive and a negative. On the one hand, we show that the strong performance of label smoothing and Mixup on image classification benchmarks is correlated with learning low variance hidden representations. On the other hand, we show that Mixup and label smoothing can be more susceptible to low variance spurious correlations in the training data.</description>

Abstract: What does it take to build mobile manipulation systems that can competently operate on previously unseen objects in previously unseen environments? This work answers this question using opening of articulated objects as a mobile manipulation testbed. Specifically, our focus is on the end-to-end performance on this task without any privileged information, i.e. the robot starts at a location with the novel target articulated object in view, and has to approach the object and successfully open it. We first develop a system for this task, and then conduct 100+ end-to-end system tests across 13 real world test sites. Our large-scale study reveals a number of surprising findings: a) modular systems outperform end-to-end learned systems for this task, even when the end-to-end learned systems are trained on 1000+ demonstrations, b) perception, and not precise end-effector control, is the primary bottleneck to task success, and c) state-of-the-art articulation parameter estimation models developed in isolation struggle when faced with robot-centric viewpoints. Overall, our findings highlight the limitations of developing components of the pipeline in isolation and underscore the need for system-level research, providing a pragmatic roadmap for building generalizable mobile manipulation systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their recent success, are hardly comprehensively tested for their cognitive abilities. Inspired by the prevalent use of the Cookie Theft task in human cognitive tests, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to evaluate high-level cognitive abilities of LVLMs using images with rich semantics. The benchmark consists of 251 images along with comprehensive annotations. It defines eight reasoning capabilities and comprises an image description task and a visual question answering task. Our evaluation of well-known LVLMs shows that there is still a significant gap in cognitive abilities between LVLMs and humans.</description>

      <title>Image and Point-cloud Classification for Jet Analysis in High-Energy Physics: A survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11934</link>

Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), in both its experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different ML and DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and establishes guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing Jets that are reconstructed in high-energy collisions, mainly in proton-proton collisions at well-defined beam energies. This section covers various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HHC), such as the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future circular collider - hadron-hadron (FCChh). The authors then explore several AI techniques analyses designed specifically for both image and point-cloud (PC) data in HEP. Additionally, a closer look is taken at the classification associated with Jet tagging in hadron collisions. In this review, various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL are examined, with a focus on their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion addresses various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP using DL methodologies. It highlights the challenges and potential areas for future research, which are illustrated for each application.</description>

      <title>Explaining Explainability: Recommendations for Effective Use of Concept Activation Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept-based explanations translate the internal representations of deep learning models into a language that humans are familiar with: concepts. One popular method for finding concepts is Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which are learnt using a probe dataset of concept exemplars. In this work, we investigate three properties of CAVs: (1) inconsistency across layers, (2) entanglement with other concepts, and (3) spatial dependency. Each property provides both challenges and opportunities in interpreting models. We introduce tools designed to detect the presence of these properties, provide insight into how each property can lead to misleading explanations, and provide recommendations to mitigate their impact. To demonstrate practical applications, we apply our recommendations to a melanoma classification task, showing how entanglement can lead to uninterpretable results and that the choice of negative probe set can have a substantial impact on the meaning of a CAV. Further, we show that understanding these properties can be used to our advantage. For example, we introduce spatially dependent CAVs to test if a model is translation invariant with respect to a specific concept and class. Our experiments are performed on natural images (ImageNet), skin lesions (ISIC 2019), and a new synthetic dataset, Elements. Elements is designed to capture a known ground truth relationship between concepts and classes. We release this dataset to facilitate further research in understanding and evaluating interpretability methods.</description>

      <title>SkinGEN: an Explainable Dermatology Diagnosis-to-Generation Framework with Interactive Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of vision language models (VLMs) technology, remarkable research achievements have emerged in the dermatology field, the fourth most prevalent human disease category. However, despite these advancements, VLM still faces explainable problems to user in diagnosis due to the inherent complexity of dermatological conditions, existing tools offer relatively limited support for user comprehension. We propose SkinGEN, a diagnosis-to-generation framework that leverages the stable diffusion(SD) model to generate reference demonstrations from diagnosis results provided by VLM, thereby enhancing the visual explainability for users. Through extensive experiments with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we identify optimal strategies for skin condition image generation. We conduct a user study with 32 participants evaluating both the system performance and explainability. Results demonstrate that SkinGEN significantly improves users' comprehension of VLM predictions and fosters increased trust in the diagnostic process. This work paves the way for more transparent and user-centric VLM applications in dermatology and beyond.</description>

      <title>ADBM: Adversarial diffusion bridge model for reliable adversarial purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Diffusion-based Purification (DiffPure) has been recognized as an effective defense method against adversarial examples. However, we find DiffPure which directly employs the original pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial purification, to be suboptimal. This is due to an inherent trade-off between noise purification performance and data recovery quality. Additionally, the reliability of existing evaluations for DiffPure is questionable, as they rely on weak adaptive attacks. In this work, we propose a novel Adversarial Diffusion Bridge Model, termed ADBM. ADBM directly constructs a reverse bridge from the diffused adversarial data back to its original clean examples, enhancing the purification capabilities of the original diffusion models. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation across various scenarios, ADBM has proven to be a superior and robust defense mechanism, offering significant promise for practical applications.</description>

      <title>MDSGen: Fast and Efficient Masked Diffusion Temporal-Aware Transformers for Open-Domain Sound Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MDSGen, a novel framework for vision-guided open-domain sound generation optimized for model parameter size, memory consumption, and inference speed. This framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a redundant video feature removal module that filters out unnecessary visual information, and (2) a temporal-aware masking strategy that leverages temporal context for enhanced audio generation accuracy. In contrast to existing resource-heavy Unet-based models, \texttt{MDSGen} employs denoising masked diffusion transformers, facilitating efficient generation without reliance on pre-trained diffusion models. Evaluated on the benchmark VGGSound dataset, our smallest model (5M parameters) achieves $97.9$% alignment accuracy, using $172\times$ fewer parameters, $371$% less memory, and offering $36\times$ faster inference than the current 860M-parameter state-of-the-art model ($93.9$% accuracy). The larger model (131M parameters) reaches nearly $99$% accuracy while requiring $6.5\times$ fewer parameters. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://bit.ly/mdsgen.</description>

      <title>Fully Unsupervised Dynamic MRI Reconstruction via Diffeo-Temporal Equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic MRI image sequences from undersampled accelerated measurements is crucial for faster and higher spatiotemporal resolution real-time imaging of cardiac motion, free breathing motion and many other applications. Classical paradigms, such as gated cine MRI, assume periodicity, disallowing imaging of true motion. Supervised deep learning methods are fundamentally flawed as, in dynamic imaging, ground truth fully-sampled videos are impossible to truly obtain. We propose an unsupervised framework to learn to reconstruct dynamic MRI sequences from undersampled measurements alone by leveraging natural geometric spatiotemporal equivariances of MRI. Dynamic Diffeomorphic Equivariant Imaging (DDEI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods such as SSDU on highly accelerated dynamic cardiac imaging. Our method is agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture and can be used to adapt the latest models and post-processing approaches.

Abstract: Prototypical part networks offer interpretable alternatives to black-box deep learning models. However, many of these networks rely on Euclidean prototypes, which may limit their flexibility. This work provides a comprehensive overview of various prototype formulations.

      <title>Diffusion Transformer Policy: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist Vision-Language-Action Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large vision-language action models pretrained on diverse robot datasets have demonstrated the potential for generalizing to new environments with a few in-domain data. However, those approaches usually predict individual discretized or continuous action by a small action head, which limits the ability in handling diverse action spaces. In contrast, we model the continuous action sequence with a large multi-modal diffusion transformer, dubbed as Diffusion Transformer Policy, in which we directly denoise action chunks by a large transformer model rather than a small action head for action embedding. By leveraging the scaling capability of transformers, the proposed approach can effectively model continuous end-effector actions across large diverse robot datasets, and achieve better generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of Diffusion Transformer Policy on Maniskill2, Libero, Calvin and SimplerEnv, as well as the real-world Franka arm, achieving consistent better performance on Real-to-Sim benchmark SimplerEnv, real-world Franka Arm and Libero compared to OpenVLA and Octo. Specifically, without bells and whistles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a single third-view camera stream in the Calvin task ABC-&gt;D, improving the average number of tasks completed in a row of 5 to 3.6, and the pretraining stage significantly facilitates the success sequence length on the Calvin by over 1.2.

      <title>A Unified Model for Compressed Sensing MRI Across Undersampling Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16290v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compressed Sensing MRI reconstructs images of the body's internal anatomy from undersampled measurements, thereby reducing the scan time - the time subjects need to remain still. Recently, deep neural networks have shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements in the frequency space. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements.
  We propose a unified model robust to different measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions in compressed sensing MRI. Our model is based on neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture. Neural operators are employed in both image and measurement space, which capture local and global image features for MRI reconstruction. Empirically, we achieve consistent performance across different undersampling rates and patterns, with an average 11 percent SSIM and 4dB PSNR improvement over a state-of-the-art CNN, End-to-End VarNet. For efficiency, our inference speed is also 1,400x faster than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enhances zero-shot super-resolution and extended field of view in reconstructed images. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging. Our code is available at https://armeet.ca/nomri.</description>

      <title>ImDy: Human Inverse Dynamics from Imitated Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse dynamics (ID), which aims at reproducing the driven torques from human kinematic observations, has been a critical tool for gait analysis. However, it is hindered from wider application to general motion due to its limited scalability. Conventional optimization-based ID requires expensive laboratory setups, restricting its availability. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit the recently progressive human motion imitation algorithms to learn human inverse dynamics in a data-driven manner. The key insight is that the human ID knowledge is implicitly possessed by motion imitators, though not directly applicable. In light of this, we devise an efficient data collection pipeline with state-of-the-art motion imitation algorithms and physics simulators, resulting in a large-scale human inverse dynamics benchmark as Imitated Dynamics (ImDy). ImDy contains over 150 hours of motion with joint torque and full-body ground reaction force data. With ImDy, we train a data-driven human inverse dynamics solver ImDyS(olver) in a fully supervised manner, which conducts ID and ground reaction force estimation simultaneously. Experiments on ImDy and real-world data demonstrate the impressive competency of ImDyS in human inverse dynamics and ground reaction force estimation. Moreover, the potential of ImDy(-S) as a fundamental motion analysis tool is exhibited with downstream applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/ImDy/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlight the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.</description>

      <title>DM-Mamba: Dual-domain Multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction poses a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the significant undersampling in k-space. Deep neural networks, such as CNNs and ViT, have shown substantial performance improvements for this task while encountering the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation. To this end, this paper pioneers exploring Mamba, a new paradigm for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, for efficient and effective MRI reconstruction. However, directly applying Mamba to MRI reconstruction faces three significant issues: (1) Mamba's row-wise and column-wise scanning disrupts k-space's unique spectrum, leaving its potential in k-space learning unexplored. (2) Existing Mamba methods unfold feature maps with multiple lengthy scanning paths, leading to long-range forgetting and high computational burden. (3) Mamba struggles with spatially-varying contents, resulting in limited diversity of local representations. To address these, we propose a dual-domain multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction from the following perspectives: (1) We pioneer vision Mamba in k-space learning. A circular scanning is customized for spectrum unfolding, benefiting the global modeling of k-space. (2) We propose a multi-scale Mamba with an efficient scanning strategy in both image and k-space domains. It mitigates long-range forgetting and achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and performance. (3) We develop a local diversity enhancement module to improve the spatially-varying representation of Mamba. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets for MRI reconstruction under various undersampling patterns. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost. Implementation code will be available at https://github.com/XiaoMengLiLiLi/DM-Mamba.</description>

      <title>What if Eye...? Computationally Recreating Vision Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision systems in nature show remarkable diversity, from simple light-sensitive patches to complex camera eyes with lenses. While natural selection has produced these eyes through countless mutations over millions of years, they represent just one set of realized evolutionary paths. Testing hypotheses about how environmental pressures shaped eye evolution remains challenging since we cannot experimentally isolate individual factors. Computational evolution offers a way to systematically explore alternative trajectories. Here we show how environmental demands drive three fundamental aspects of visual evolution through an artificial evolution framework that co-evolves both physical eye structure and neural processing in embodied agents. First, we demonstrate computational evidence that task specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution - orientation tasks like navigation in a maze leads to distributed compound-type eyes while an object discrimination task leads to the emergence of high-acuity camera-type eyes. Second, we reveal how optical innovations like lenses naturally emerge to resolve fundamental tradeoffs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover systematic scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing, showing how task complexity drives coordinated evolution of sensory and computational capabilities. Our work introduces a novel paradigm that illuminates evolutionary principles shaping vision by creating targeted single-player games where embodied agents must simultaneously evolve visual systems and learn complex behaviors. Through our unified genetic encoding framework, these embodied agents serve as next-generation hypothesis testing machines while providing a foundation for designing manufacturable bio-inspired vision systems.
